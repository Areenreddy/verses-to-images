a love supreme, a love supreme

Sex fingers toes
in the marketplace
near your father's church
in Hamlet, North Carolina—
witness to this love
in this calm fallow
of these minds,
there is no substitute for pain:
genitals gone or going,
seed burned out,
you tuck the roots in the earth,
turn back, and move
by river through the swamps,
singing: a love supreme, a love supreme;
what does it all mean?
Loss, so great each black
woman expects your failure
in mute change, the seed gone.
You plod up into the electric city—
your song now crystal and
the blues. You pick up the horn
with some will and blow
into the freezing night:
a love supreme, a love supreme—

Dawn comes and you cook
up the thick sin 'tween
impotence and death, fuel
the tenor sax cannibal
heart, genitals, and sweat
that makes you clean—
a love supreme, a love supreme—

Why you so black?
cause I am
why you so funky?
cause I am
why you so black?
cause I am
why you so sweet?
cause I am
why you so black?
cause I am
a love supreme, a love supreme:

So sick
you couldn't play Naima,
so flat we ached
for song you'd concealed
with your own blood,
your diseased liver gave
out its purity,
the inflated heart
pumps out, the tenor kiss,
tenor love:
a love supreme, a love supreme—
a love supreme, a love supreme—","a love supreme, a love supreme. ""There is no substitute for pain"" ""Loss, so great each black woman expects your failure,"" says the poet. ""A love supreme"" is a ""love supreme"" with ""a heart, genitals, and sweat that makes you clean""","'Dear John, Dear Coltrane' by Michael S. Harper is a powerful poem that speaks to the importance of John Coltrane's music. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker begins by alluding to an act of violence perpetrated on a Black man in the American south. He immediately describes Coltrane growing up in the same area and leaving for Philadelphia to play music. As the poem progresses, the speaker introduces the reader to Coltrane's creative expression, his struggle with drugs and alcohol, and later, the liver disease that resulted."
1,"The old sick green parrot
High in a dingy cage
Sick with malevolent rage
Beadily glutted his furious eye
On the old dark
Chimneys of Noel Park
Far from his jungle green
Over the seas he came
To the yellow skies, to the dripping rain,
To the night of his despair.
And the pavements of his street
Are shining beneath the lamp
With a beauty that’s not for one
Born under a tropic sun.
He has croup. His feathered chest
Knows no minute of rest.
High on his perch he sits
And coughs and spits,
Waiting for death to come.
Pray heaven it won’t be long.","The parrot was born under a tropic sun. He has croup. His feathered chest knows no minute of rest. He coughs and spits, waiting for death to come.Pray heaven it won’t be long. He sits on his perch he sits.","‘Parrot‘ depicts the declining health of a wondrously beautiful bird in north London, where it appears to have been taken against its will. The poem begins by describing the unwell bird and its view over the houses near Noel Park in north London. The creature’s ill health is emphasized as early as the poem’s opening line. As the poem continues, Smith creates a sense of dislocation by contrasting the bird’s current surroundings with the tropical environment it came from. In the final stanza, the parrot appears close to death, and Smith appears to hope for its swift arrival so that the bird may be free from its suffering."
2,"The way a crow
Shook down on me
The dust of snow
From a hemlock tree

Has given my heart
A change of mood
And saved some part
Of a day I had rued.",The way a crow grabbed hold of me was like a change of mood. The dust of snow                From a hemlock tree                 has given my heart a new lease of life. The way a crows' talons closed around me was the way a man's heart closed around him.,"The simplicity, in the end, is the key element of the work as nature is shown as magnificent enough to bring a person into a pleasant mentality. It grounds the narrator in a satisfying place, like a “tree,” and this uncomplicated action is mirrored in the uncomplicated wording, techniques, and structure of ‘Dust of Snow.’ Together, these elements solidify the theme of ‘Dust of Snow’: that nature and simplicity, if appreciated and looked into, can be grounding factors in a time of stress."
3,"She practises a fugue, though it can matter
to no one now if she plays well or not.
Beside her on the floor two children chatter,
then scream and fight. She hushes them. A pot
boils over. As she rushes to the stove
too late, a wave of nausea overpowers
subject and counter-subject. Zest and love
drain out with soapy water as she scours
the crusted milk. Her veins ache. Once she played
for Rubinstein, who yawned. The children caper
round a sprung mousetrap where a mouse lies dead.
When the soft corpse won't move they seem afraid.
She comforts them; and wraps it in a paper
featuring: Tasty dishes from stale bread.","She practises a fugue, though it can matter to no one now if she plays well or not. Once she played for Rubinstein, who yawned. The children caperaround a sprung mousetrap where a mouse lies dead. She comforts them; and wraps it in a paper.","'Suburban Sonnet' by Gwen Harwood is a poem about the difficulties of motherhood and the mental and emotional struggles of a housewife. In the first lines of 'Suburban Sonnet,' the speaker describes a housewife who spends her time practicing a fugue, a specific type of musical composition. She knows that it doesn't matter to anyone whether or not she plays well, but she continues to. There are two children in the room, screaming at one another. This forces her to stop playing until she can quiet them down. Suddenly, another one of her duties as a housewife calls: a pot on the stove is boiling over. She suddenly feels completely overwhelmed, sick, and in pain. The poet compares the woman's happiness to the soap running down the drain. This leads to another personal music-related image. Her children are looking at a dead mouse in a trap, feeling scared despite it being dead. She disposes of the creature with an article featuring bread recipes."
4,"I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times…
In life after life, in age after age, forever.
My spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs,
That you take as a gift, wear round your neck in your many forms,
In life after life, in age after age, forever.

Whenever I hear old chronicles of love, its age-old pain,
Its ancient tale of being apart or together.
As I stare on and on into the past, in the end you emerge,
Clad in the light of a pole-star piercing the darkness of time:
You become an image of what is remembered forever.

You and I have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount.
At the heart of time, love of one for another.
We have played alongside millions of lovers, shared in the same
Shy sweetness of meeting, the same distressful tears of farewell-
Old love but in shapes that renew and renew forever.

Today it is heaped at your feet, it has found its end in you
The love of all man’s days both past and forever:
Universal joy, universal sorrow, universal life.
The memories of all loves merging with this one love of ours –
And the songs of every poet past and forever.","I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times…                In life after life, in age after age, forever.                My spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs,                That you take as a gift, wear round your neck in your many forms.","'Unending Love' by Rabindranath Tagore is a heartfelt poem about a speaker's devotional love for his beloved (the creator or his lady love). Tagore's poetic persona describes how his love merges with all the loves, past and forever. This piece of Rabindranath Tagore is another song in which, it seems, he speaks of his love for the creator. It can also be true that this poem can be written for a lady whom the speaker loves the most. His words reflect his deeper emotions and the devotional aspect of love between two souls. Tagore's persona gifts her with a “necklace of songs” which she wears in pride. He compares her to the polestar that pierces all the darkness of pessimism and enlightens him. Their love is old, yet it renews forever. In her, she has found universality and their memories of togetherness will last forever."
5,"When trees have lost remembrance of the leaves
that spring bequeaths to summer, autumn weaves
and loosens mournfully—this dirge, to whom
does it belong—who treads the hidden loom?

When peaks are overwhelmed with snow and ice,
and clouds with crepe bedeck and shroud the skies—
nor any sun or moon or star, it seems,
can wedge a path of light through such black dreams—

All motion cold, and dead all traces thereof:
What sudden shock below, or spark above,
starts torrents raging down till rivers surge—
that aid the first small crocus to emerge?

The earth will turn and spin and fairly soar,
that couldn't move a tortoise-foot before—
and planets permeate the atmosphere
till misery depart and mystery clear!—

And yet, so insignificant a hearse?—
who gave it the endurance so to brave
such elements?—shove winter down a grave?—
and then lead on again the universe?","When trees have lost remembrance of the leaves that spring bequeaths to summer, autumn weaves and loosens mournfully. When peaks are overwhelmed with snow and ice, clouds with crepe bedeck and shroud the skies, no sun or moon or star, it seems, can wedge a path of light through such black dreams.","'Crocus' by Alfred Kreymborg describes the vast darkness of winter and the immensely powerful “spark” which leads the world into spring. The poem begins with the speaker stating that now is the time in which spring and summer are so far in the past that the trees have forgotten they ever had left. The narrator is overwhelmed by the dark cold of the season and wants to know whose fault it is that the world is the way it is. He continues on to speak about the eventual “spark” that will come and set the Earth turning once more. It will set spring in motion, lead the crocuses to bloom, and overflow the rivers with water."
6,"Can someone make my simple wish come true?
Male biker seeks female for touring fun.

Gay vegetarian whose friends are few, vegetarian into music, Shakespeare and the sun. Executive in search of something new. Bisexual woman, arty, young. Attractive Jewish lady with a son.","'Lonely Hearts' by Wendy Cope is an ironic poem that reveals how a speaker is desperately searching for a life partner in a newspaper column. This poem begins with a speaker asking others whether they can find her a perfect partner. Her simple wish deals with only finding a partner with whom she can start a relationship. The speaker is middle-aged and has a son. She is inexperienced, cold, and fascinated by a new beginning. Her partner can be a biker or a gay vegetarian with few friends. She is also a lonely soul and takes interest in music and Shakespeare's poetry. The partner can be an executive who is searching for a bisexual woman with arty looks. Whatsoever, all she wants is a partner who resides in North London."
7,"All right. Try this,
Then. Every body
I know and care for,
And every body
Else is going
To die in a loneliness
I can't imagine and a pain
I don't know. We had
To go on living. We
Untangled the net, we slit
The body of this fish
Open from the hinge of the tail
To a place beneath the chin
I wish I could sing of.
I would just as soon we let
The living go on living.
An old poet whom we believe in
Said the same thing, and so
We paused among the dark cattails and prayed
For the muskrats,
For the ripples below their tails,
For the little movements that we knew the crawdads were making

under water,
For the right-hand wrist of my cousin who is a policeman.
We prayed for the game warden's blindness.
We prayed for the road home.
We ate the fish.
There must be something very beautiful in my body,
I am so happy.","An old poet whom we believe in said the same thing, and so. We paused among the dark cattails and prayed. We ate the fish. There must be something very beautiful in my body, I am so happy. I wish I could sing of it. We had to let the living go on living.","'Northern Pike' by James Wright is a peaceful poem about a fishing trip and a speaker's appreciation for nature and life. The poem describes the images he saw on a fishing trip and his experience with the fish itself. He notes the beautiful, life-affirming sights and sounds in his vicinity and how killing and eating the fish made him feel. The poem ends on an optimistic note, suggesting that happiness can be found through simple pleasures in the natural world."
8,"Somewhere in the dark sky is a beautiful fight,
one-two, cha cha chá—all our knuckles rapping

against the stars’ edges for the dancing master,
for a flying sidekick to our bodies’ centers.

My father called you Little Dragon Lee, told me
how you swiveled your hips across the floor—

three-four, cha cha chá—then you both wrote
love poems for a girl in your English class.

I practiced throwing roundhouse kicks as a boy,
feet aimed at my reflection in store windows,

at street signs, at parked cars, everything I knew
I could break. Now, my feet cannot leave

the ground, and I write love poems for the dead.
The last time I watched Enter the Dragon,

I imagined it was my father emerging victorious
from the hall of mirrors, my father hustling

on the dance floor, because the last time
I saw my father, he had been waiting for me

the whole day in the morgue. Hold me,
he said, and I did until his body stopped

acting like it was alive. There is no fight
where there is no spark, no wretched cock crow

in the dark, just this cha cha chá—grief is a fist
and a promise to hurt someone. Just give it

an inch between knuckle and breastbone.
It will punch through everyone.","Somewhere in the dark sky is a beautiful fight, one-two, cha cha chá. My father called you Little Dragon Lee, told me how you swiveled your hips across the floor. Now, my feet cannot leave the ground, and I write love poems for the dead.","'Elegy for Bruce Lee' by W. Todd Kaneko begins with the measured 'one-two, ch cha chá' that echoes as a beat throughout the poem. The rhythm is reflecting the steady pace of throwing punches, Kaneko reflecting Bruce Lee's fighting practice. Kaneko discusses his father in relation to Bruce Lee, using him as an example of how to fight, but also how to live life. When Kaneko's father dies, he remembers the feeling of grief, expressing it through the practice of fighting. The final lines reflect on this fusion of grief and fighting, drawing the two images together in a somber combination."
9,"born gorgeous with nerves, with brains
the pink of silver polish or
jellyfish wafting ornately
through the body below.
An invertebrate cooing
on the mother
tongue shushes and lulls them into thinking
all is well. As they grow they learn

salvage: tear-out
guides to happiness say apologies can outshine
lies, guilt be lickspittled from their lives, bad
glycerined to good. Like a child’s first school pencils
in their formal brilliance
and sharp new smells, they lie

as lovers. Maybe one cries
the wrong name and the night skinning
them pleasantly alive
leaps away in shards.
Then it’s time for restitution:
a tin of homebaked,
holding gingham safety, fetal
as the light through mason jars of beets and brine,
or jewelry, clasping and unclasping
aisles of fluorescence from great department stores,
a distracting plenitude, and tempting.

Still, the beloved may stay bitter as an ear
the tongue pressed
into, unwanted.
And the word end: spiney, finally-formed,
indents them and is
understood. They learn

the hard way as hurts
accrue, and the brain is cratered as a rock
by rain that fell ages past
on unprotected mud. An insult keeps
despite apologies. When it vaporizes at last,
its space fills with grains that harden
to a fossil shaped exactly
like the insult.
They grow up when they know that

sometimes
only a gesture responsive as a heart-
shaped parachute above a jump
a life depends on
to be perfect

The beloved may stay bitter as an ear and the tongue pressed into unwanted.","'Babies' by Alice Fulton is a powerful poem filled with images that describe what it's like to age from childhood into adulthood. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker describes what a child is like when they're born. They are lulled by their mother's soothing voice into thinking that everything is going to be all right. Life feels simple when one is young. But, as a child ages, they learn that not all lies or mistakes can be erased. The poet uses an example of a scorned lover, called by the wrong name while in bed, whose affections cannot be regained. One simple mistake can ruin someone's chances at happiness. The poem concludes with a very effective image comparing life, or at least some parts of it, to a parachuter jumping out of a plane. One has a single chance to get things right."
10,"Love is like water or the air
my townspeople;
it cleanses, and dissipates evil gases.
It is like poetry too
and for the same reasons.
Love is so precious
my townspeople
that if I were you I would
have it under lock and key—

It's like poetry too, and for the same reasons.","Riposte' by William Carlos Williams is a short poem about the power of love and how impossible it is to sustain or control it. In the lines of 'Riposte,' the speaker addresses “townspeople,” a group he refers to as “my townspeople.” He's giving these men and women a lesson in love. He tells them that it is the same as water, air, and poetry. Meaning, it clears the air of poisonous gasses and makes life all-around easier to live. Through the poem, the poet also alludes to humanity's inability to capture and control love, just as they can't control the Atlantic ocean, air, or poetry."
11,"The apes yawn and adore their fleas in the sun.
The parrots shriek as if they were on fire, or strut
Like cheap tarts to attract the stroller with the nut.
Fatigued with indolence, tiger and lion

Lie still as the sun. The boa-constrictor’s coil
Is a fossil. Cage after cage seems empty, or
Stinks of sleepers from the breathing straw.
It might be painted on a nursery wall.

But who runs like the rest past these arrives
At a cage where the crowd stands, stares, mesmerized,
As a child at a dream, at a jaguar hurrying enraged
Through prison darkness after the drills of his eyes
On a short fierce fuse. Not in boredom—
The eye satisfied to be blind in fire,
By the bang of blood in the brain deaf the ear—
He spins from the bars, but there’s no cage to him

More than to the visionary his cell:
His stride is wildernesses of freedom:
The world rolls under the long thrust of his heel.
Over the cage floor the horizons come.","The apes yawn and adore their fleas in the sun. The parrots shriek as if they were on fire, or strut. Like cheap tarts to attract the stroller with the nut. The boa-constrictor’s coil                Is a fossil. Cage after cage seems empty, or smells of sleepers.","The Jaguar' by Ted Hughes is a powerful poem that describes a zoo, its sorrowful inhabitants, and the one creature that hasn't given into despair. In the first two stanzas of 'The Jaguar,' Hughes speaker describes a few of the many depressed animals that make up a zoo. They include parrots shrieking for food, apes, and lethargic lions and tigers. He also makes sure, within these lines, to emphasize how “un-wild” these animals are, suggesting that something more, besides their freedom, has been taken from them. In the middle of the poem, he brings in a young child visiting the zoo and uses him to draw the poem towards the jaguar, the centerpiece of the zoo. The cat appears to be, by the speaker's account, the only animal that has a depressed representative of its species. Its power is on full display as the speaker alludes to the wildness that still resides within the cat's eyes and heart."
12,"I saw a little elephant standing in my garden,
I said 'You don't belong in here', he said 'I beg your pardon?',
I said 'This place is England, what are you doing here?',
He said 'Ah, then I must be lost' and then 'Oh dear, oh dear'.

'I should be back in Africa, on Saranghetti's Plain',
'Pray, where is the nearest station where I can catch a train?'.
He caught the bus to Finchley and then to Mincing lane,
And over the Embankment, where he got lost, again.

The police they put him in a cell, but it was far too small,
So they tied him to a lampost and he slept against the wall.
But as the policemen lay sleeping by the twinkling light of dawn,
The lampost and the wall were there, but the elephant was gone!

So if you see an elephant, in a Jumbo Jet,
You can be sure that Africa's the place he's trying to get!","I saw a little elephant standing in my garden. I said 'You don't belong in here', he said 'I beg your pardon?'

But as the policemen lay sleeping by the twinkling light of dawn, the elephant was gone!","'Jumbo Jet' by Spike Milligan tells the story of an elephant that is in London and trying to make its way back to Africa. In the first lines of this piece, the speaker begins by telling the reader how he went outside one day and found an elephant in his garden. He was shocked to see him there and told him immediately that he shouldn't be there. The elephant was confused but eventually realized how lost he is. In the next lines, the elephant asks for the speaker's help getting back to Africa and the plains on which he should be roaming. The poem concludes with the speaker describing how the elephant got lost after getting to the Thames Embankment. He was then caught by police, tied up outside to a lamppost, and then become lost once more when he wandered off during the early morning hours. In the final couplet the speaker, in an upbeat tone, assures the reader that if they see an elephant on a “Jumbo Jet” plane that he is simply trying to get home to Africa."
13,"Lovely dainty Spanish needle
With your yellow flower and white,
Dew bedecked and softly sleeping,
Do you think of me to-night?
Shadowed by the spreading mango,
Nodding o'er the rippling stream,
Tell me, dear plant of my childhood,
Do you of the exile dream?
Do you see me by the brook's side
Catching crayfish 'neath the stone,

Coming from the woodland spring
With a bamboo on my shoulder
And a pail slung from a string?
Do you see me all expectant
Lying in an orange grove,
While the swee-swees sing above me,
Waiting for my elf-eyed love?
Lovely dainty Spanish needle,
Source to me of sweet delight,
In your far-off sunny southland
Do you dream of me to-night?","Lovely dainty Spanish needle is a poem about a young boy's first love. The poem is written in rhyming couplets. It is set to the tune of ""The Wheels on the Bus"" by The Beatles. The song was written in the 1960s and 1970s and was written by Henry James.","'The Spanish Needle' by Claude McKay is a beautiful, nostalgic poem that looks back on a speaker's childhood. In the stanzas, the speaker asks the Spanish needle, a type of plant, if it remembers him during his youth. He has fond memories of spending time outside, near a river, carrying water, and spending time with his love. It's clear he's feeling nostalgic about his past and hoping that through the plant, a tiny bit of himself still exists in the past."
14,"When we talk about when to tell the kids,
we are so together, so concentrated.
I mutter, “I feel like a killer.” “I’m
the killer”—taking my wrist—he says,
holding it. He is sitting on the couch,
the old indigo chintz around him,
rich as a night sea with jellies,
I am sitting on the floor. I look up at him,
as if within some chamber of matedness,
some dust I carry around me. Tonight,
to breathe its Magellanic field is less
painful, maybe because he is drinking
a wine grown where I was born—fog,
eucalyptus, sempervirens—and I’m
sharing the glass with him. “Don’t catch
my cold,” he says, “—oh that’s right, you want
to catch my cold.” I should not have told him that,
I tell him I will try to fall out of
love with him, but I feel I will love him
all my life. He says he loves me
as the mother of our children, and new troupes
of tears mount to the acrobat platforms
of my ducts and do their burning leaps.
Some of them jump straight sideways, and, for a
moment, I imagine a flurry
of tears like a whirra of knives thrown
at a figure, to outline it—a heart’s spurt
of rage. It glitters, in my vision, I nod
to it, it is my hope.","When we talk about when to tell the kids, we are so together, so concentrated. I tell him I will try to fall out of love with him, but I feel I will love him all my life.

The poem explores the end of love, relationships coming to an end, and how that can impact people. Olds moves through many emotions in the poem, beginning with worry and ending with anger. The poem is melancholic, Olds not quite knowing how to deal with the conversation. The poet's partner is pragmatic, planning their future conversation with careful certainty. The final section of the poem focuses on Olds' emotions, her sadness transforming into anger. This anger is the only thing Olds has left now, focusing on that to try and drown out the pain of falling out of love. She has to adapt to the situation as it is, surprised by things that have changed between them."
15,"When I looked up, the black man was there,
staring into my face,
as if he had always been there,
as if he and I went a long way back.
He looked into the dark pool of my eyes
as the train slid out of Euston.
For a long time this went on
the stranger and I looking at each other,
a look that was like something being given
from one to the other.
My whole childhood, l'm quite sure,
passed before him, the worst things
I've ever done, the biggest lies I've ever told.
And he was a little boy on a red dust road.
He stared into the dark depth of me,
and then he spoke:
'lbo
,' he said. 'lbo, definitely.'
Our train rushed through the dark.
'You are an Ibo!' he said, thumping the table.
My coffee jumped and spilled.
Several sleeping people woke.
The night train boasted and whistled
through the English countryside,
past unwritten stops in the blackness.
'That nose is an Ibo nose.
Those teeth are Ibo teeth,' the stranger said,
his voice getting louder and louder.
l had no doubt, from the way he said it,
that Ibo noses are the best noses in the world,
that lbo teeth are perfect pearls.
People were walking down the trembling aisle
to come and look
as the night rain babbled against the window.
There was a moment when
my whole face changed into a map,
and the stranger on the train
located even, the name
of my village in Nigeria
in the lower part of my jaw.
I told him what I'd heard was my father's name.
Okafor. He told me what it meant,
something stunning,
something so apt and astonishing.
Tell me, I asked the black man on the train
who was himself transforming,
at roughly the same speed as the train,
and could have been
at any stop, my brother, my father as a young man,
or any member of my large clan,
Tell me about the lbos.
His face had a look
I've seen on a MacLachlan, a MacDonell, a MacLeod,
the most startling thing, pride,
a quality of being certain.
'Now that I know you are an Ibo, we will eat.'
He produced a spicy meat patty,
ripping it into two.
Tell me about the lbos.
'The lbos are small in stature
Not tall like the Yoruba or Hausa.
The lbos are clever, reliable,
dependable, faithful, true.
The Ibos should be running Nigeria.
There would be none of this corruption.'
And what, I asked, are the lbos faults?
I smiled my newly acquired lbo smile,
flashed my gleaming lbo teeth.
The train grabbed at a bend,
'Faults? No faults. Not a single one.'
'If you went back,' he said brightening,
'The whole village would come out for you.
Massive celebrations. Definitely.
Definitely,' he opened his arms wide.
'The eldest grandchild- fantastic welcome.
If the grandparents are alive.'
I saw myself arriving
the hot dust, the red road,
the trees heavy with other fruits,
the bright things, the flowers.
I saw myself watching
Jackie Kay
Lucozade, The Shoes of Dead Comrades, Pride
the old people dance towards me
dressed up for me in happy prints.
And I found my feet.
I started to dance.
I danced a dance I never knew I knew.
Words and sounds fell out of my mouth like seeds.
I astonished myself.
My grandmother was like me exactly, only darker.

Only my own face startled me in the dark train window.","When I looked up, the black man was there, staring into my face. He looked into the dark pool of my eyes as the train slid out of Euston.

She meets a black man on the train with whom she has an instant connection. She feels as though he can see into her mind and her past. To an extent, this proves to be true. They speak, and he explains that she is Ibo or that she comes from a specific tribe in Africa. This is highly relevant to the speaker, who is on a journey of self-discovery. They converse further, and he makes her feel as though her identity is something to be incredibly proud of. When the poem concludes, it becomes clear that the speaker has imagined this entire interaction."
16,"Miss Helen Slingsby was my maiden aunt,
And lived in a small house near a fashionable square
Cared for by servants to the number of four.
Now when she died there was silence in heaven
And silence at her end of the street.
The shutters were drawn and the undertaker wiped his feet—
He was aware that this sort of thing had occurred before.
The dogs were handsomely provided for,
But shortly afterwards the parrot died too.
The Dresden clock continued ticking on the mantelpiece,
And the footman sat upon the dining-table
Holding the second housemaid on his knees—
Who had always been so careful while her mistress lived.","Miss Helen Slingsby was my maiden aunt. She lived in a small house near a fashionable square. She was cared for by servants to the number of four. When she died there was silence in heaven and silence at her end of the street.

Eliot takes a look into the life of a recently deceased woman who appears to have been unloved while she was alive. The poem details the aftermath of this woman's death. Eliot's speaker discusses the silence on the street and alludes to the lack of mourners around the woman. Despite being her nephew, the speaker does not show any emotion. He is not grieving for her in this elegy, he is simply noting the facts of her death. The strongest emotion in the poem comes at the end when the speaker mentions the housemaid flirting with the footman."
17,"I wonder how it all got started, this business
about seeing your life flash before your eyes
while you drown, as if panic, or the act of submergence,
could startle time into such compression, crushing
decades in the vice of your desperate, final seconds.

After falling off a steamship or being swept away
in a rush of floodwaters, wouldn't you hope
for a more leisurely review, an invisible hand
turning the pages of an album of photographs-
you up on a pony or blowing out candles in a conic hat.

How about a short animated film, a slide presentation?
Your life expressed in an essay, or in one model photograph?
Wouldn't any form be better than this sudden flash?
Your whole existence going off in your face
in an eyebrow-singeing explosion of biography-
nothing like the three large volumes you envisioned.

Survivors would have us believe in a brilliance
here, some bolt of truth forking across the water,
an ultimate Light before all the lights go out,
dawning on you with all its megalithic tonnage.
But if something does flash before your eyes
as you go under, it will probably be a fish,

a quick blur of curved silver darting away,
having nothing to do with your life or your death.
The tide will take you, or the lake will accept it all
as you sink toward the weedy disarray of the bottom,
leaving behind what you have already forgotten,
the surface, now overrun with the high travel of clouds.","I wonder how it all got started, this business about seeing your life flash before your eyes.

The poem begins with the speaker asking why and how the idea of life flashing before one's eyes came into being. He is mystified by it and encourages the reader to consider the same question. As the poem progresses he discusses how inadequate and distressing this experience would be. He also proposes a number of alternatives, such as a photo album being turned slowly or an essay. 'The Art of Drowning' ends with the speaker discusses one death by drowning and how one's memories would quickly be forgotten. They'd remain at the surface as one's body drifted to the bottom of a lake."
18,"I used to think that grown-up people chose
To have stiff backs and wrinkles round their nose,
And veins like small fat snakes on either hand,
On purpose to be grand.
Till through the banisters I watched one day
My great-aunt Etty’s friend who was going away,
And how her onyx beads had come unstrung.
I saw her grope to find them as they rolled;
And then I knew that she was helplessly old,
As I was helplessly young.","I used to think that grown-up people chose. to have stiff backs and wrinkles round their nose,                And veins like small fat snakes on either hand,                On purpose to be grand.

The poem begins from a point of scepticism on behalf of the narrator who is a small child. They do not believe the cosmetic reminders of age on people they encounter to be anything more than deliberate choices, like the clothes they wear. It is only after they witness an elderly person in distress that they begin to realise that age is something genuinely debilitating and they can no longer return to their earlier ignorance of it."

The final lines are addressed to Christ himself and implore him to continue guiding human beings down a righteous path, one that follows Christ's teachings."
20,"Now that I have your face by heart, I look Less at its features than its darkening frame Where quince and melon, yellow as young flame, Lie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd’s crook. Beyond, a garden. There, in insolent ease
The lead and marble figures watch the show Of yet another summer loath to go
Although the scythes hang in the apple trees.
Now that I have your face by heart, I look.
Now that I have your voice by heart, I read In the black chords upon a dulling page Music that is not meant for music’s cage,
Whose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed. The staves are shuttled over with a stark Unprinted silence. In a double dream I must spell out the storm, the running stream. The beat’s too swift. The notes shift in the dark.
Now that I have your voice by heart, I read.
Now that I have your heart by heart, I see
The wharves with their great ships and architraves; The rigging and the cargo and the slaves
On a strange beach under a broken sky.
O not departure, but a voyage done!
The bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps
Its red rust downward, and the long vine creeps Beside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that she knows her partner so well, their face is memorized on her heart. She will go on to say the same about their heart and voice. She has spent a great deal of time with this person, so much so she has neglected the rest of the world. 'Song for the Last Act' works as a mental and emotional stopping point for the speaker in this relationship. She is finally looking beyond her partner to everything fading and changing. The season of summer, a pattern of music, and a ship's voyage all mark the end of something. The speaker does not give a clear description of whether or not this is a happy or sad ending. One can infer from the description of the anchor in the final stanza and the descriptions of fading warmth and music that the change is painful."
21,"Traveling through the dark I found a deer
dead on the edge of the Wilson River road.
It is usually best to roll them into the canyon:
that road is narrow; to swerve might make more dead.
By glow of the tail-light I stumbled back of the car and stood by the heap, a doe, a recent killing; she had stiffened already, almost cold.
I dragged her off; she was large in the belly.
My fingers touching her side brought me the reason—
her side was warm; her fawn lay there waiting, alive, still, never to be born.
Beside that mountain road I hesitated.
The car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights; under the hood purred the steady engine.
I stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red; around our group I could hear the wilderness listen.
I thought hard for us all—my only swerving—, then pushed her over the edge into the river.","Traveling through the dark I found a deer dead on the edge of the road.

The speaker starts the poem by describing how he saw a deer on the side of the road and decided to stop and roll the body off and out of the way. This, he says, could save someone from losing their life. Before he can roll the deer into the river, he realizes that she's pregnant and that the fawn is still alive. This makes him pause. He considers what he's supposed to do in this scenario while the wilderness listens. He chooses to go ahead with his original plan and rolls her into the river."
22,"I’ve known rivers:
I’ve known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins.

My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he knows rivers very well. There are a few in particular he wants to share with the reader. All of them are among the largest and longest on the planet. They have also all played host to some of the most important historical events and civilizations on the planet. The speaker has seen humankind's first moments alongside the Euphrates, participated in the building of the pyramids, and listened to the Mississippi while Abraham Lincoln was sibling down it. The poem concludes with a repetition of the opening lines, making sure a reader is aware of the speaker's deep connection to the bodies of water."
23,"How do you like to go up in a swing,
Up in the air so blue?
Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing
Ever a child can do!
Up in the air and over the wall,
Till I can see so wide,
Rivers and trees and cattle and all
Over the countryside—
Till I look down on the garden green,
Down on the roof so brown—
Up in the air I go flying again,
Up in the air and down!","How do you like to go up in a swing, says the author. ""Up in the air so blue? I do think it the pleasantest thing a child can do,"" he writes. ""I can see so wide, I can see rivers and trees and cattle and all,"" he adds.","'The Swing' by Robert Louis Stevenson is a simple profession of love for the joys of swinging told from the perspective by a young speaker. The poem begins with the speaker asking the listener how much they like to swing up into the blue air. This is a rhetorical question, as seen by the speaker's quick response. They love it more than anything and think it's the best thing a child could spend their time doing. In the next stanza, the child speaker describes how when they are swinging at their highest height they are able to see over a wall and into the countryside beyond. There are farmlands and farm animals, all waiting to be discovered. On the way back down they see the brown roof of their home. The descent is dragged out by the long “o” sounds utilized by Stevenson, but once they reach the bottom they quickly escape from the mundane and travel back up into the sky."
24,"Go to the western gate, Luke Havergal,
There where the vines cling crimson on the wall,
And in the twilight wait for what will come.

Like flying words, will strike you as they fall;
But go, and if you listen she will call.
Go to the western gate, Luke Havergal—
Luke Havergal.


No, there is not a dawn in eastern skies
To rift the fiery night that’s in your eyes;
But there, where western glooms are gathering,

And hell is more than half of paradise.

Out of a grave I come to quench the kiss
That flames upon your forehead with a glow
That blinds you to the way that you must go.

Bitter, but one that faith may never miss.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that it is time for Luke Havergal to go to the “western gate.” It is here he will leave his present unsatisfactory life and find a new one. If he does cross over, which the speaker believes is inevitable, he will have a new lover. There is a woman waiting for him. In the following lines, the speaker describes a light in Luke Havergal's head. It is blinding him to his correct path. She intends to put it out and steer him to the gate. The speaker makes it clear she has come from the other side to guide him. The poem concludes with the speaker reiterating the text of the first stanza and making sure that Luke Havergal understands that his chance to find this woman is not unlimited. He must go now if he ever wants to be happy."

She was attacked on the bridge with eggs and stones in response to political discontent."
26,"THE frost has settled down upon the trees
And ruthlessly strangled off the fantasies
Of leaves that have gone unnoticed, swept like old
Romantic stories now no more to be told.
The trees down the boulevard stand naked in
thought,
Their abundant summery wordage silenced, caught
In the grim undertow; naked the trees confront
Implacable winter's long, cross-questioning brunt.
Has some hand balanced more leaves in the depths
of the twigs?
Some dim little efforts placed in the threads of the
birch?—
It is only the sparrows, like dead black leaves on
the sprigs,
Sitting huddled against the cerulean, one flesh with
their perch.
The clear, cold sky coldly bethinks itself.
Like vivid thought the air spins bright, and all
Trees, birds, and earth, arrested in the after-thought
Awaiting the sentence out from the welkin brought.","The trees down the boulevard stand naked in thought, their abundant summery wordage silenced. The clear, cold sky coldly bethinks itself.

Lawrence describes the coming of the winter frost and the perilous position it places all life on the “Boulevard.” The poem begins with the speaker stating that the frost has landed on the trees and started to strangle the reaming leaves from their branches. They are cut down, blown away, and buried in the snow. Their “fantasies” of making it through the season are no more. Within the next lines, the speaker describes how the now naked trees are forced to confront the coming season. They are at risk from the weather and know it. In the third stanza, the speaker notices a few tiny sparrows huddled together amongst the leaves and twigs. They attempt to keep warm and serve as a reminder that life still exists during this season. The poem concludes with the speaker stating that all life on earth is at the mercy of the “welkin,” or sky and heavens. There is nothing on can do to truly contend with the frost, when it decides to come."
27,"A fortnight before Christmas Gypsies were everywhere:
Vans were drawn up on wastes, women trailed to the fair.
'My gentleman,' said one, 'you've got a lucky face.'
'And you've a luckier,' I thought, 'if such a grace
And impudence in rags are lucky.' 'Give a penny
For the poor baby's sake.' 'Indeed I have not any
Unless you can give change for a sovereign, my dear.'
'Then just half a pipeful of tobacco can you spare?'
I gave it. With that much victory she laughed content.
I should have given more, but off and away she went
With her baby and her pink sham flowers to rejoin
The rest before I could translate to its proper coin
Gratitude for her grace. And I paid nothing then,
As I pay nothing now with the dipping of my pen
For her brother's music when he drummed the tambourine
And stamped his feet, which made the workmen passing grin,
While his mouth-organ changed to a rascally Bacchanal dance
'Over the hills and far away.' This and his glance
Outlasted all the fair, farmer, and auctioneer,
Cheap-jack, balloon-man, drover with crooked stick, and steer,
Pig, turkey, goose, and duck, Christmas Corpses to be.
Not even the kneeling ox had eyes like the Romany.
That night he peopled for me the hollow wooded land,
More dark and wild than stormiest heavens, that I searched and scanned
Like a ghost new-arrived. The gradations of the dark
Were like an underworld of death, but for the spark
In the Gypsy boy's black eyes as he played and stamped his tune,
'Over the hills and far away', and a crescent moon.","A fortnight before Christmas Gypsies were everywhere:Vans were drawn up on wastes, women trailed to the fair.

The poem begins with the speaker talking to one gypsy woman. He ends up giving her some tobacco, but wishes he had given her more, especially after hearing her brother play. The majority of the poem is focused on the sights and sounds around the woman's brother. He stamps his feet and sings and plays the “mouth-organ.” The speaker describes the festivities in the camp as “Bacchanal.” In the last lines, the speaker wishes that he could've thanked the family sufficiently for the way he was transported out of his life and into an emotional, dark, and intense mental landscape. This experience has given him something to write about, and he can't pay them back for that."

29,"They laughed at one I loved-
The triangular hill that hung
Under the Big Forth. They said
That I was bounded by the whitethorn hedges
Of the little farm and did not know the world.
But I knew that love's doorway to life
Is the same doorway everywhere.
Ashamed of what I loved
I flung her from me and called her a ditch
Although she was smiling at me with violets.

But now I am back in her briary arms
The dew of an Indian Summer lies
On bleached potato-stalks

Nothing of cities,
I cannot die

I flung her from me and called her a ditch. But now I am back in her briary arms.,"'Innocence' by Patrick Kavanagh describes the deep connection a farmer has to his land and the farmer's immortal sense of being. The poem begins with the speaker stating that there are those who have in the past made fun of the “one” he loves. This “one” is a patch of land. It is not particularly big, but it is special to the speaker. Others see the farm as too contained and separate from the rest of the world though. It is “innocent” and has made the speaker “innocent” as well. There were times that this thought bothered the speaker, but he always came back to the land in the end. In the last two stanzas, the speaker admires the land he has and considers his own agelessness. His continual existence within this one spot has taken him beyond a mortal understanding of time. Now, he is without age or death. The only way he could die is if he left the land he loves."
30,"Since I am coming to that holy room,
Where, with thy choir of saints for evermore,
I shall be made thy music; as I come
I tune the instrument here at the door,
And what I must do then, think here before.

Flat on this bed, that by them may be shown
That this is my south-west discovery,

I joy, that in these straits I see my west;
For, though their currents yield return to none,
What shall my west hurt me? As west and east
In all flat maps (and I am one) are one,
So death doth touch the resurrection.

The eastern riches? Is Jerusalem?

As the first Adam's sweat surrounds my face,
May the last Adam's blood my soul embrace.
So, in his purple wrapp'd, receive me, Lord;
By these his thorns, give me his other crown;

The poem begins with the speaker describing the room in which he is dying. He will soon leave it for the “holy room.” Here he will become a music-filled saint, tuned to God's liking. The words he is speaking are used as preparation for what is to come later. He is bracing himself for his own death and entry to Heaven. The speaker describes how there are physicians around him mapping out his body as if they are “Cosmographers.” They are seeking out their own answers and he is seeking the discovery of another world. Death is not something he is afraid of. In fact, he sees it as being an integral part of life, just as the crucifixion was a part of the resurrection. In the last stanzas, he asks that God recognize his goodness and the good he has done on earth through his written works. If God can do this, perhaps he will enter into Heaven just like Christ."
31,"It doesn’t interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart’s longing.

It doesn’t interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love, for your dream, for the adventure of being alive.

It doesn’t interest me what planets are squaring your moon. I want to know if you have touched the centre of your own sorrow, if you have been opened by life’s betrayals or have become shrivelled and closed from fear of further pain.

I want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or your own, without moving to hide it, or fade it, or fix it.

I want to know if you can be with joy, mine or your own; if you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful, be realistic, remember the limitations of being human.

It doesn’t interest me if the story you are telling me is true. I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself. If you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul. If you can be faithless and therefore trustworthy.

I want to know if you can see Beauty even when it is not pretty every day. And if you can source your own life from its presence.

I want to know if you can live with failure, yours and mine, and still stand at the edge of the lake and shout to the silver of the full moon, ‘Yes.’

It doesn’t interest me to know where you live or how much money you have. I want to know if you can get up after the night of grief and despair, weary and bruised to the bone and do what needs to be done to feed the children.

It doesn’t interest me who you know or how you came to be here. I want to know if you will stand in the centre of the fire with me and not shrink back.

It doesn’t interest me where or what or with whom you have studied. I want to know what sustains you from the inside when all else falls away.

I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments.",It doesn’t interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart’s longing. If you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul. And if you can see Beauty even when it is not pretty every day.,"The Invitation' by Oriah Mountain Dreamer is made up of a speaker's interests and disinterests when it comes to a possible relationship. The poem begins with the speaker making two initial statements about what she does and does not want to know about a possible lover. First, she does not care what they do for a living. She does care about their dreams and what their heart aches for secretly. The speaker goes on to add that she wants her life and that of her lover to be filled with the great adventure of being alive. One of the most poignant metaphors crafted by Dreamer in the text is the comparison between the listener's interests and planets. They circle around this person, making up their exterior image. This is a perfect example of the type of information the speaker doesn't care about. She continues on to develop another important aspect of the text, how the listener stands up to scrutiny, loss, and disaster. Her lover's strength mentally and emotionally is crucial. They must not flinch from the “flames” and be willing to stand up to their own, and even her, failures. As 'The Invitation' progresses she adds that she doesn't care about her listener's children, past, or the mask they wear in public. Everything she needs to know comes from within her lover's soul. The poem concludes with the speaker expressing her interest in knowing if her listener could live within their own mind, without the company of others. Their interior fortitude is a deal-breaker for her."
32,"Today the ghetto knows a different fear,
Close in it grip, death weilds an icy scythe.
An sickeness spreads a terror in its wake,
The victims of its shadow weep and writhe.

Today fathers heartbeat tell his fright.
And Mother's bend their heads into their hands,
Now children choke and die with typhus here,
A bitter tax is taken ftom their hands.

My heart still beats inside my breast
While friends depart for other worlds.
Perhaps its better-who can say?
Than watching this, to die today?

No,No, my God we want to live.
Not watch our numbers melt away.

We want to work-we must not die!","Today the ghetto knows a different fear, the fear of death. The victims of its shadow weep and writhe. Children choke and die with typhus here,                A bitter tax is taken ftom their hands. My heart still beats inside my breast, while friends depart for other worlds.","Fear' by Eva Picková is a haunting and memorable poem that focuses on one young girl's experiences during the Holocaust. The poem details the impact of typhus on her community as those she cares for suffering and die around her. The lines clearly convey her terrified tone and the fear that she experiences on a daily basis. In the third stanza, she considers whether or not it would be better to die than to continue on this way but quickly changes her mind. She decides instead that she wants to, and her friends and family need to, live to make the world better."

'To A Louse' by Robert Burns is a verse describing a louse and its features. The poet has seen it crawling impudently over the gauzes and laces of a fair lady's bonnet. Bonnet is a woman's hat tied under the chin and with a brim framing the face. Ladies put on this hat as an accompaniment. However, in this poem, the poet finds the louse at once crawling and at times hiding. Sometimes it tries to peep out showing its blood-filled belly and its noticeable legs. The poet talks with it as if it's a little devil sinning the sanctified environment of a church! It is destined to feed on some poor lady or boy's blood, not of that beautiful lady. Moreover, the poet thinks that louse symbolizes the nature of human vanity. The louse in its ugly form proves the futility of one's thinking about oneself. "
34,"The panther is like a leopard,
Except it hasn't been peppered.
Should you behold a panther crouch,
Prepare to say Ouch.
Better yet, if called by a panther,

Don’t anther!","'The Panther' by Ogden Nash is a short children's poem that uses humor to describe a leopard and a panther. The poem addresses the similarities between panthers and leopards and then notes, with humor, that the panther is different because it hasn't been “peppered.” Its coat is solid versus the leopard whose coat is spotted. The speaker also says that if “you,” the reader, ever see a panther “crouch,” that you need to be prepared to say “ouch.” The poem concludes with one more humorous moment that suggests readers should stay away from these powerful animals."
35,"Move him into the sun—
Gently its touch awoke him once,
At home, whispering of fields half-sown.
Always it woke him, even in France,
Until this morning and this snow.
If anything might rouse him now
The kind old sun will know.

Think how it wakes the seeds—
Woke once the clays of a cold star.
Are limbs, so dear-achieved, are sides
Full-nerved, still warm, too hard to stir?
Was it for this the clay grew tall?

To break earth's sleep at all?","Move him into the sun. The kind old sun will know. It woke him, even in France, until this morning and this snow. The clay grew tall for this.

A soldier has died, and his companions reminisce on death and its proximity to wakefulness. Images of death and life are intertwined throughout the poem, and the final effect is of a poem that is close to Biblical, tortured, and beautiful, but ultimately a lament on the waste of innocent lives."
36,"Sing a song of sixpence,
A pocket full of rye,
Four and twenty blackbirds
Baked in a pie.

When the pie was opened
The birds began to sing—

To set before the king?

Counting out his money,

There is historical evidence that suggests the act of putting a live bird in a pie was something that really happened. There are records of a recipe calling for that very thing from 1549. It was also referred to in another cookbook by John Nott in 1725. The bird was meant to remain alive and fly out when the pie was cut. Iona and Peter Opie's The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes from 1951 acknowledges a variety of historical events that could be tied to the rhyme. The moon and sun could represent a queen and king, they say, the blackbirds the hours of the day or an allusion to monks. Unsurprisingly, the rhyme has also been connected to Henry VIII and his marriages Anne Boleyn is suggested to be the maid and Catherine of Aragon, the queen. There is no hard evidence for this theory."

nine a.m. downtown San Francisco
a bright yellow garbage truck
with two garbagemen in red plastic blazers

with an elegant couple in it

in a hip three-piece linen suit

and hunched back
looking down like some
gargoyle Quasimodo
And the younger of the two
also with sunglasses and long hair
about the same age as the Mercedes driver

And both scavengers gazing down
as from a great distance
at the cool couple
as if they were watching some odourless TV ad
in which everything is always possible

And the very red light for an instant

The class differences and economic circumstances could not be juxtaposed to a greater degree. The poem ends with an allusion to the fact that the “gulf” shouldn't exist within the United States."

The poem takes the reader through a series of images that set out a world that is less about omens, dead birds, drowned men, and dreams than it is about analysis and photographs. She juxtaposes crime scenes with ants feasting on the corpse of a dead bird in the first lines and then goes on to discuss her personal dreams and what they may or may not say about life in general."

Writing deposit slips and checks

He taught me how.
This is the form,
he must have said:
the way it is done.
I learned to see
bits of paper
as a way
to escape
the life he knew
and even in high school
had a savings
account.


He taught me
that telling the truth
did not always mean
a beating;
though many of my truths
must have grieved him
before the end.

How I miss my father!
He cooked like a person
dancing
in a yoga meditation
and craved the voluptuous
sharing
of good food.

Now I look and cook just like him:
my brain light;
tossing this and that
into the pot;
seasoning none of my life
the same way twice; happy to feed
whoever strays my way.

to admire
the women I've become:
cooking, writing, chopping wood,
staring into the fire.","How i miss my father. He taught me how to write deposit slips and checks. He cooked like a person.

The poem begins with the speaker clearly stating how much she misses her father and how she regrets the hard life he had to live. She describes the ways that her father taught her. These range from how to cook to how to save money for a better future. She closely associates her father with money and banking slips. He was frugal from a young age and passed that trait onto her. She describes his movements in the kitchen and how now, after he is gone, she has taken on his eccentricities, sharing food as liberally as he did and never living the same day twice. Poem at Thirty-Nine concludes with the speaker finding peace in her memories and the thought that her father would be proud of the woman she has become."

Some say in ice.

But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great

But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate to say that for destruction ice is also great.","Throughout history, there has always been a seeming fascination with how the world will end. In recent years, these discussions have centered around nuclear disaster, immense climate change, and general cynicism. Two thousand years ago (give or take), the Revelations chapter was added into the Christian Bible, detailing a prophetic vision of the end of the world. This has long been a topic embedded in the human psyche. At some point between the present and Revelations’ authorship (closer to the present though), Robert Frost added his own ideas to the mix, and the result was ‘Fire and Ice’, one of his most well-known poems, and certainly one of his most powerful ones. This poem is known for its simplicity and biting message, as well as its call to stop and think, offering a different perspective on the end of everything."
41,"Between my finger and my thumb The squat pen rests; snug as a gun.
Under my window, a clean rasping sound When the spade sinks into gravelly ground: My father, digging. I look down
Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds Bends low, comes up twenty years away Stooping in rhythm through potato drills Where he was digging.
The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft Against the inside knee was levered firmly.
He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep
To scatter new potatoes that we picked,
Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
By God, the old man could handle a spade. Just like his old man.
My grandfather cut more turf in a day
Than any other man on Toner’s bog.
Once I carried him milk in a bottle
Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up
To drink it, then fell to right away
Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods
Over his shoulder, going down and down
For the good turf. Digging.
The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap
Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge
Through living roots awaken in my head.
But I’ve no spade to follow men like them.
Between my finger and my thumb
The squat pen rests.
I’ll dig with it.","Between my finger and my thumb The squat pen rests; snug as a gun. Under my window, a clean rasping sound When the spade sinks into gravelly ground: My father, digging. I look down until his straining rump among the flowerbeds comes up twenty years away.","This poem is autobiographical in nature. The speaker, presumably Heaney, is sitting at his writing desk, preparing to write, when he hears his father working in the garden outside. This conjures memories of the speaker as a young boy, listening and watching as his father digs in the potato garden. The speaker marvels at how well his father digs, which conjures an even older memory of his grandfather, his father's father, completing the arduous task of digging through peat moss. Toward the end of the poem, the speaker writes as though he can smell the potatoes from the garden and the peat moss his grandfather has dug. He confesses that he does not have a spade like the two generations before him, but he does have a pen which he will use to “dig.”"

In the first lines of this poem the speaker, who is unnamed, describes Aunt Jennifer's work. She's creating a needlepoint image of tigers. They're beautiful, described as brightly shining gemstones living in green canvas. There is also the addition of men in the image. They're watching the tigers who move without fear. The speaker spends time describing how fast Jennifer's fingers move and the weight of the wedding ring on her finger. The speaker looks to the future at the end of the poem. One day Jennifer is going to die and her frightened hands will stop moving. But, the tigers will not."
43,"Trust me. The world is run on a shoestring.
They have no time to return the calls in hell

But by then it will be too late.,"Hard Times' by John Ashbery is a poem where the speaker openly ponders upon life, mortality, and the way people live in the 20th-century world. In the first verse, Ashbery's speaker expresses that people have busy lives and miss out on spending time with the dear ones in their lives. He says that someday, they will have time, but by then, it will not matter anymore because life is short and random. In the last two verses, the poet's tone becomes dystopian as he describes how the planets around the earth are “decoration,” which speaks to the peculiar way in which the speaker thinks. Lastly, the speaker describes how the couple completed their trip to California successfully. They can deem themselves as different from other people because they spent time together in California. It is clear whether they did not make memories they would cherish for the rest of their lives. Instead, the memories of living there would come to haunt them. "
44,"Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)

But cheerly still; and said, ""I pray thee, then,
Write me as one that loves his fellow men.""

In the first lines of this poem, Hunt starts out the story of Abou Ben Adhem by blessing him. He has just woken up from a “deep dream of peace” to a lovely room that's filled with moonlight. It turns out that it was an angel that woke him. The angel is writing in a book, taking down the names of all those who love God. Adhem realizes that his name is not on the list. So, rather than ask to be added, he tells the angel to make a list of people who love their “fellow men” and put his name on it. Through this request, his name gets added to a list of those blessed by God."

They are seen as frail and unachieved, yet there is still much that they hope to finish in their lives. Fearing suggests that old men have the potential that society doesn't really understand. The first stanza is designated to explore the stereotype of old men. Particularly, Fearing looks at how they are forgotten, fading into the background. Yet, stanza two focuses on the promise of the future. Many of these forgotten old men have the potential to do great things. Fearing suggests that they can achieve their dreams and should not be underestimated."

And dew still glistened on the tangled thorn,
And lingered on the branches of the lime,

And nymphs and satyrs vanished from your clime.
Then maidens bearing parsley in their hands

When all the world was waking into morn, dew still glistened on the tangled thorn, and lingered on the branches of the lime.Oh peerless singer of  the golden rhyme,Happy wert thou to live ere doubt was born.","'To Sappho I' by Sara Teasdale speaks on the beauty of the past as seen from a tainted future that has lost its joy and magic. The poem begins with the speaker addressing Sappho, a female poet of ancient Greece, and describing the world in which she must have lived. It was a happy time in which nature was pristine and there was no “doubt” present in everyday life. The doubt that the speaker is describing can refer to doubt in oneself or doubt in one's purpose in the world. This is backed up in the next lines as the speaker refers to the earth as being half worn out by the progress that humankind has made. There is no more need for magic or myths and “nymphs and satyrs” have vanished from the eye of the people. The poem concludes with the speaker comparing Sappho's world to that of the modern age. There is no longer the dedication to gods and goddesses, nor is there the desire to explore the mysteries of the Earth as they have already been mapped. The time in which the ancient poet lived was before Venus, or Aphrodite, was lost from the water, and before Ceres, or Demeter, lost Persephone to Hades. These myths form a before and after wall to the two worlds of these poets."

Silent Noon” by Dante Gabriel Rossetti describes an “inarticulate” moment of peace that two lovers spend within the grass of a pasture. The poem begins with the speaker stating a simple fact about his lover's hand, that it appears to him like “rosy blooms” as it peeks through the long grass in which they are reclining. He can tell from her eyes that she, as he does, appreciates the peace of this moment. They both know that it is not going to last forever, but that only increases the beauty. As the speaker describes their surroundings it is as if everything has been enhanced. The pasture is “gleam[ing] and gloom[ing]” as the clouds “scatter and amass” in front of the sun. The couple has buried themselves amongst the grasses, creating a sort of nest from which they are able to look out at the flowers and plants that surround them. The silence they are existing in is so still, it is like an hourglass. In the second stanza, the speaker describes his appreciation for this moment. He and his lover “clasp” the time they have together to their chests and take none of it for granted. They know that soon it will be over and they will have to depart again. In the final lines, the speaker describes the presence of silence as being a physical representation of the love the two share."

Sweet-voiced they sang beneath the sunset sky,
Their mother's home was near.
Plump Gertrude passed me with her basket full,
A stronger hand than hers helped it along;
A voice talked with her through the shadows cool
More sweet to me than song.
Ah Willie, Willie, was my love less worth
Than apples with their green leaves piled above?
I counted rosiest apples on the earth
Of far less worth than love.
So once it was with me you stooped to talk
Laughing and listening in this very lane:
To think that by this way we used to walk
We shall not walk again!

And groups; the latest said the night grew chill,
And hastened: but I loitered, while the dews
Fell fast I loitered still.",I plucked pink blossoms from mine apple-tree and wore them all that evening in my hair. But in due season when I went to see                I found no apples there. With dangling basket all along the grass I went the selfsame track.My neighbours mocked me while they saw me pass                So empty-handed back.,"An Apple Gathering' by Christina Rossetti describes the plight of a woman who had a relationship before marriage, effectively ending her chance at a good life. The poem begins with the speaker describing how she chose to pick the pink flowers from her apple tree. This choice changed the course of her life. Rather than wait for marriage and gather her apples when they were ripe, she engaged in a sexual relationship with a man who did not love her. When she returns to the tree, and there are no apples to harvest, she falls into a deep depression. She realizes that the prospect of her having a good life is virtually zero. The speaker returns to the path she traveled and becomes more dejected and overwhelmed as she passes others with full baskets."

for the lady who has gone,
fertile source of guilt and pain.
The worst birth in the annals of Brooklyn,
that was my cue to come on,
my first claim to fame.

Naturally, she longed for a girl,
and all my infant curls of brown
couldn’t excuse my double blunder
coming out the wrong sex,
and the wrong way around.
Not readily forgiven,

So you never nursed me
and when all my father’s songs
couldn’t sweeten the lack of money,
when poverty comes throught the door
love flies up your chimney,
your favourite saying,

might never have known me,
if I had not cycled down
to court you like a young man,
teasingly untying your apron,
drinking by the fire, yarning

Of your wild, young days
which didn’t last long, for you,
lovely Molly, the belle of your small town,
landed up mournful and chill
as the constant rain that lashes it
wound into your cocoon of pain.

Standing in that same hallway,
Don’t come again.you say, roughly,
I start to get fond of you, John,
and then you are up and gone;
the harsh logic of a forlorn woman
resigned to being alone.

And still, mysterious blessing,
I never knew, until you were gone,
that, always around your neck
you wore an oval locket
with an old picture in it,
of a child in Brooklyn.","Sing a last song for the lady who has gone, a source of guilt and pain.

The poem takes the reader through a series of moments, from his birth to his mother's death. Their relationship was fraught from the moments of his birth. Montague describes how from the start his mother was disappointed and pained by him. He felt guilt over this and tried throughout his life to make her love him. She sent him away in his youth but he continued to visit her for a time until she told him to stop. The poem concludes with the revelation that throughout her life she wore a locket with the poet's picture inside."

The poem begins with the speaker telling his lover, someone with whom he has been in love with, that he wants to mount their head on the wall. This violent statement speaks to a need to destroy, but also to own. It is an idea that thrills the speaker, as it would allow him to take back something from the listener. Their love is not what it used to be, as is seen through the cold tone of these lines. In the second half of 'I am Trying to Break Your Heart' the emotions are more confused. There is some tenderness in his heart. This is seen through his desire to nurture what remains of the love, to put the taxidermy lover back together, and make sure he doesn't lose any skin."
51,"How many dawns, chill from his rippling rest
The seagull’s wings shall dip and pivot him,
Shedding white rings of tumult, building high
Over the chained bay waters Liberty—
Then, with inviolate curve, forsake our eyes As apparitional as sails that cross
Some page of figures to be filed away;
—Till elevators drop us from our day ...
I think of cinemas, panoramic sleights
With multitudes bent toward some flashing scene
Never disclosed, but hastened to again,
Foretold to other eyes on the same screen;
And Thee, across the harbor, silver paced
As though the sun took step of thee yet left
Some motion ever unspent in thy stride,—
Implicitly thy freedom staying thee!
Out of some subway scuttle, cell or loft
A bedlamite speeds to thy parapets,
Tilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning,
A jest falls from the speechless caravan.

A rip-tooth of the sky’s acetylene;
All afternoon the cloud flown derricks turn ...

Of anonymity time cannot raise:
Vibrant reprieve and pardon thou dost show.

Prayer of pariah, and the lover’s cry,
Again the traffic lights that skim thy swift
Unfractioned idiom, immaculate sigh of stars,
Beading thy path—condense eternity:
And we have seen night lifted in thine arms.
Under thy shadow by the piers I waited
Only in darkness is thy shadow clear.
The City’s fiery parcels all undone,
Already snow submerges an iron year ...

Vaulting the sea, the prairies’ dreaming sod, Unto us lowliest sometime sweep, descend
And of the curveship lend a myth to God.","How many dawns, chill from his rippling rest, the seagull’s wings shall dip and pivot him. Thee, across the harbor, silver paced.

'To Brooklyn Bridge' by Hart Crane begins with the image of the seagulls flying over the bridge at dawn. Thereafter the poet goes on to refer to the modern images such as some page of figures filed away and the cinema screen. Moreover, the poet presents a picture of the silvery bridge at dawn. Then, again the poet shifts from the description of the bridge to an insane who jumps off the bridge. In the following stanzas, the poet associates spiritual elements with the bridge. Moreover, he thinks that the bridge connects earth to heaven. At last, there is a request to the bridge for coming down from its height and be one of them."
52,"Sex, as they harshly call it,

I fell into this morning

at ten o'clock, a drizzling hour

of traffic and wet newspapers.

I thought of him who yesterday

clearly didn't

turn me to a hot field

and longing for that young man

pierced me to the roots

bathing every vein, etc.

All day he appears to me

touchingly desirable,

a prize one could wreck one's peace for.

didn't take so many years

but lust too is a jewel

a sweet flower and what

pure happiness to know

all our high-toned questions

breed in a lively animal.

That ""old last act""!

And yet sometimes

all seems post coitum triste

and I a mere bystander.

Somebody else is going off,

getting shot to the moon.

Or, a moon-race!

Split seconds after

my opposite number lands

I make it---

we lie fainting together

at a crater-edge

heavy as mercury in our moonsuits

till he speaks---

in a different language

yet one I've picked up

through cultural exchanges. . .

In the first song, the speaker shares the incident directly. It occurred to her on a morning at about ten o'clock. It was drizzling outside and within she felt a craving for the young man. She made love with him, whom she did not love. Rich uses the plowing metaphor in order to describe the act of lovemaking. In the second song, the speaker focuses on the “old last act” or the culmination of the act. She can vividly remember how they fainted together in the bed. She felt as if they shot for the moon during lovemaking. In the end, she talks about how they thanked each other as if they both were invested in a mechanical act, devoid of the emotion of love. "

The Greek story of Philomena can be found here. To summarize, Philomena was the sister of Procne, who married the Thracian king, Tereus. After being married for a number of years and living in Thrace, Procne wanted to see her sister, Philomena. Tereus went to retrieve Philomena from Athens and on the way back Tereus assaulted Philomena in a small cabin in the woods. He then abandoned her and cut out her tongue. After this tragedy had befallen Philomena she wove her story into a tapestry and had it delivered to her sister in Thrace. Procne, wanting to take revenge on her husband, killed her son by Tereus and served the boy to his father during a meal. Tereus found out what had happened and attempted to kill Procne. The gods saved the two women by turning Philomena into a nightingale and Procne into a swallow. Tereus was transformed into a hoopoe, another type of bird."

The poem starts with the speaker telling whoever is reading the poem to remember that mirrors are untrustworthy. They show someone looking into them what's on the surface. But, they have no access to what's inside one's mind or heart. Nor can they see “you” when you're living in the happiest moments of life or sleeping peacefully. One should be wary of basing their self-worth off of what they see in the mirror."

No one she knows can afford to spend time on dreams, not when there are much more important things to focus on like “rent” and family needs."
56,"Yet once an earlier David took
Smooth pebbles from the brook:
Out between the lines he went
To that one-sided tournament,
A shepherd boy who stood out fine
And young to fight a Philistine
Clad all in brazen mail. He swears
That he's killed lions, he's killed bears,
And those that scorn the God of Zion
Shall perish so like bear or lion.
But ... the historian of that fight
Had not the heart to tell it right.

Striding within javelin range,
Goliath marvels at this strange
Goodly-faced boy so proud of strength.
David's clear eye measures the length;
With hand thrust back, he cramps one knee,
Poises a moment thoughtfully,
And hurls with a long vengeful swing.
The pebble, humming from the sling
Like a wild bee, flies a sure line
For the forehead of the Philistine;
Then ... but there comes a brazen clink,
And quicker than a man can think
Goliath's shield parries each cast.
Clang! clang! and clang! was David's last.
Scorn blazes in the Giant's eye,
Towering unhurt six cubits high.
Says foolish David, ""Damn your shield!
And damn my sling! but I'll not yield.""
He takes his staff of Mamre oak,
A knotted shepherd-staff that's broke
The skull of many a wolf and fox
Come filching lambs from Jesse's flocks.
Loud laughs Goliath, and that laugh
Can scatter chariots like blown chaff
To rout; but David, calm and brave,
Holds his ground, for God will save.
Steel crosses wood, a flash, and oh!
Shame for beauty's overthrow!
(God's eyes are dim, His ears are shut.)
One cruel backhand sabre-cut
""I'm hit! I'm killed!"" young David cries,
Throws blindly forward, chokes ... and dies.
And look, spike-helmeted, grey, grim,
Goliath straddles over him.","The historian of that fight had not the heart to tell it right. Yet once an earlier David took Smooth pebbles from the brook. He stood out fine, young to fight a PhilistineClad all in brazen mail. He swears that he's killed lions, bears, and wolves.","Goliath and David' by Robert Graves retells the story of “David and Goliath” in a darker, more realistic manner in which David does not prevail over the giant. The poem begins with the speaker describing the actions of the young David before the battle. In this short stanza, he gathers pebbles from a stream and tries to gain strength from his previous endeavors. In the second part of 'Goliath and David', in which all of the action is contained, the speaker tells a different story of the battle between a giant and a shepherd. As in the traditional manner, David throws a pebble at Goliath's head with his sling. But rather than knock him dead, the giant deflects it with his shield. David throws another, and another, with the same outcome. At this point, he is frustrated and terrified. He “damns” his weapon and takes up another—his staff which is used in his duties as a shepherd's son. The two come to blows, Goliath's metal sword against the wooden staff. With only one swing the boy is felled. His death comes quick and Goliath straddles his body in an act of domination. This retelling of a traditional story shows that in all situations an underdog cannot prevail. In the real world, that which is not contained within fiction, death comes for those with lesser means."

The speaker takes the reader through some of the many things in life that bore him. He knows he shouldn't say so, but life itself is boring. He takes no pleasure from books or peoples. The great stories of people like Achilles also bore him. It's not until the last lines of the poem that it becomes relatively clear that the speaker is so bored because he's lost something integral to his life—companionship. A dog is used as a symbol of that missing companionship and the mark it's left behind. "

Only a question less or a question more.Nothing to match the flight of wild birds flying. Tiresome heart, forever living and dying, house without air.","Wild Swans' by Edna St. Vincent Millay tells of a speaker's desperation to get out of her current physical and emotional space and find a new, bird-like freedom. The poem begins with the speaker feeling shocked at the sight of wild swans flying over her home. There is something about their shapes on this day that strikes her. She is suddenly determined to look into her heart and pick out the parts of herself that have confined her. The speaker sees her current life as “Tiresome.” She is metaphorically chained to her daily emotional pattern and would like to fly over the town, just like the swans. By the end of the poem the speaker has decided that she is going to leave the suffocating home she's been stuck in for so long. She is also desperate for the swans to come back and show her again how to fly over the town. When this happens her heart will be free, her old life will sit far below her, and all the possibilities the swans have access to will be hers as well."
59,"f you don't know the kind of person I am
and I don't know the kind of person you are
a pattern that others made may prevail in the world
and following the wrong god home we may miss our star.

a shrug that lets the fragile sequence break
sending with shouts the horrible errors of childhood
storming out to play through the broken dike.

And as elephants parade holding each elephant's tail,
but if one wanders the circus won't find the park,
I call it cruel and maybe the root of all cruelty
to know what occurs but not recognize the fact.

And so I appeal to a voice, to something shadowy,
a remote important region in all who talk:
though we could fool each other, we should consider—
lest the parade of our mutual life get lost in the dark.

The poem begins with the speaker imagining a scenario in which he does not know his listener and they do not know him. If this was the case between them, or between any other couple in a relationship, there is a chance they will “miss [their] star.” One's shot at creating a fulfilling life can easily slip away if the “wrong god” is followed. He goes on to describe how relationships fall apart through the explosion of childhood experiences and the indifferent “shrug.” These things can be avoided if one is only willing to make their own path. The poem concludes with the speaker asking that everyone listening to the text of the poem make their “signals” clear to one another. Human beings should help each other through the “deep” darkness of life."

In the first stanza, the child spends the lines talking about his Halloween costume. He's dressed up as Dracula and is clearly very proud of that fact. He elaborates on what he looks like and what he's wearing. The second stanza is similar to the first, but it goes into more detail about what he looks like, all the way down to his fingernails. Finally, in the third stanza, it becomes clear that the speaker has made a big mistake. He thought the Halloween part was “today,” but it is not actually until next week. This is something that immediately confronts the speaker when he walks into a school and sees that no one else is wearing a costume. He feels foolish and completely embarrassed about this mistake."

Where bodies are drawn into grass
That feeds no flocks, and into evergreens
That bear no fruit —
There where along the shaded walks
Vain sighs are heard,
And vainer dreams are dreamed
Of close communion with departed souls —
But here under the apple tree
I loved and watched and pruned
With gnarled hands
In the long, long years;
Here under the roots of this northern-spy
To move in the chemic change and circle of life,
Into the soil and into the flesh of the tree,
And into the living epitaphs
Of redder apples!","Not in that wasted garden where bodies are drawn into grass that feeds no flocks, and into evergreens that bear no fruit. But here under the apple tree.

'Conrad Siever' by Edgar Lee Masters is a poem based on the theme of autumn. Death and decay features from the beginning of the poem. The poet feels for the withering trees and rotting plants the farm has turned into a graveyard. But, the poet isn't sitting there. He sits under the northern-spy apple tree which still has its time. Winter is not far ahead. Then everything will be changed, even the poet's favorite apple tree. However, at last, the poet feels satisfied with the red apples that he can still enjoy at that time of the year and imagines those apples to be the “living epitaphs” of the northern-spy."
65,"I don’t love you as if you were a rose of salt, topaz, or arrow of carnations that propagate fire: I love you as one loves certain obscure things, secretly, between the shadow and the soul.
I love you as the plant that doesn’t bloom but carries the light of those flowers, hidden, within itself, and thanks to your love the tight aroma that arose from the earth lives dimly in my body.
I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where, I love you directly without problems or pride:
I love you like this because I don’t know any other way to love,
except in this form in which I am not nor are you, so close that your hand upon my chest is mine, so close that your eyes close with my dreams.","I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where, I love you directly without problems or pride.

I loveYou as the plant that doesn't bloom but carries the light of those flowers, hidden, within itself.","'One Hundred Love Sonnets: XVII' by Pablo Neruda describes the love he feels and how it surpasses any previous definition of what love could be. In the first stanza, the speaker lists out a few things that his love is not like. These objects, a rose and a flaming arrow are traditional representatives of love. His emotions go far beyond the physical. They exist deeper and are present in the “shadow and the soul.” This makes it seem as if his emotions are forbidden or ephemeral. They cannot be pegged down to anything as trite as a rose. The next section describes how his love is going to exist, no matter what. It is like the love one would feel for a flower that is not blooming, existing needless of exterior beauty. In the final lines, the speaker gives up trying to define his love through metaphor. He admits that he loves this person, and that is that. There is no better way to put it."
66,"The difference between poetry and rhetoric
is being ready to kill
yourself
instead of your children.

I am trapped on a desert of raw gunshot wounds
and a dead child dragging his shattered black
face off the edge of my sleep
blood from his punctured cheeks and shoulders
is the only liquid for miles
and my stomach
churns at the imagined taste while
my mouth splits into dry lips
without loyalty or reason
thirsting for the wetness of his blood
as it sinks into the whiteness
of the desert where I am lost
without imagery or magic
trying to make power out of hatred and destruction
trying to heal my dying son with kisses
only the sun will bleach his bones quicker.

A policeman who shot down a ten year old in Queens
stood over the boy with his cop shoes in childish blood
and a voice said “Die you little motherfucker” and
there are tapes to prove it. At his trial
this policeman said in his own defense
“I didn't notice the size nor nothing else
only the color”. And
there are tapes to prove that, too.

Today that 37 year old white man
with 13 years of police forcing
was set free
by eleven white men who said they were satisfied
justice had been done
and one Black Woman who said
“They convinced me” meaning
they had dragged her 4'10'' black Woman's frame
over the hot coals
of four centuries of white male approval
until she let go
the first real power she ever had
and lined her own womb with cement
to make a graveyard for our children.

I have not been able to touch the destruction
within me.
But unless I learn to use
the difference between poetry and rhetoric
my power too will run corrupt as poisonous mold
or lie limp and useless as an unconnected wire
and one day I will take my teenaged plug
and connect it to the nearest socket
raping an 85 year old white woman
who is somebody's mother
and as I beat her senseless and set a torch to her bed
a greek chorus will be singing in 3/4 time

Within the text of 'Power' Lorde addresses the murder of Clifford Glover and the court was that did not bring justice for the child or his family. She speaks on her rage and how that rage is connected to the anger of all of those abused at the hands of white oppressors throughout time. The poet uses disturbing images of violence and death to strike at the heart of the rhetoric around whiteness and blackness. She also compares that rhetoric to the power that poetry has to do in the face of these injustices."
67,"You that are dear, O you above the rest!
Forgive him his evasive moods and cold;
The absence that belied him oft of old,
The war upon sad speech, the desperate jest,
And pity’s wildest gush but half-confessed,

Some written word once tender and once bold,
Or service done shamefacedly at best,
Whereby to judge him. All his days he spent,
Like one who with an angel wrestled well,
O’ermastering Love with show of light disdain;
And whatso’er your spirits underwent,
He, wounded for you, worked no miracle
To make his heart’s allegiance wholly plain.","You that are dear, O you above the rest! Forgive him his evasive moods and cold. The absence that belied him oft of old. The war upon sad speech, the desperate jest, and pity’s wildest gush but half-confessed.","'Reserve' by Louise Imogen Guiney tells of a man's love for a listener to whom he has done some irreconcilable wrong. The speaker begins by stating her love and appreciation for an unknown listener. This listener has started to sever ties with someone that they both know. It does not become clear until the end of the poem, but the male figure in this piece (who is in need of forgiveness) is in a relationship with the listener. He has done something undefined to the intended listener and he/she has not been able to forgive him. The speaker takes on the role of mediator and asks that the listener recall his/her memories of the times they had in the past and find some way to forgive him for what he has done. She also reminds the listener of the love that he holds for her/him and the “plainness” of his feelings."
68,"To unearth the roots

The poem begins with the speaker referring to a banyan tree and how hard it is to unroot it. The only way to get rid of it is to cut it down. This occurs later on in the text, but in the meantime, the language surrounding the tree is expanding to describe a specific city in India. It too is old, weathered, and becoming more and more dilapidated as time passes. Eventually, the tree is cut down, metaphorically alluding to the end of the city itself. But, the poem ends optimistically with the speaker describing rebirth and the possibilities of the future."

your words like stones!

The poem takes the reader through the speaker's need to separate her “beloved” from their words and thoughts. She encourages this person to come with her to the garden to see the lilies, the view, and quiet their words. They need quiet time and a few moments to contemplate one another and life itself."
70,"Hark to the Sourdough story, told at sixty below,
When the pipes are lit and we smoke and spit
Into the campfire glow.
Rugged are we and hoary, and statin' a general rule,
A genooine Sourdough story
Ain't no yarn for the Sunday School.
A Sourdough came to stake his claim in Heav'n one morning early.
Saint Peter cried: ""Who waits outside them gates so bright and pearly?""
""I'm recent dead,"" the Sourdough said, ""and crave to visit Hades,
Where haply pine some pals o' mine, includin' certain ladies.""
Said Peter: ""Go, you old Sourdough, from life so crooly riven;
And if ye fail to find their trail, we'll have a snoop round Heaven.""
He waved, and lo! that old Sourdough dropped down to Hell's red spaces;
But though 'twas hot he couldn't spot them old familiar faces.
The bedrock burned, and so he turned, and climbed with footsteps fleeter,
The stairway straight to Heaven's gate, and there, of course, was Peter.
""I cannot see my mates,"" sez he, ""among those damned forever.
I have a hunch some of the bunch in Heaven I'll discover.""
Said Peter: ""True; and this I'll do (since Sourdoughs are my failing)
You see them guys in Paradise, lined up against the railing -
As bald as coots, in birthday suits, with beards below the middle . . .
Well, I'll allow you in right now, if you can solve a riddle:
Among that gang of stiffs who hang and dodder round the portals,
Is one whose name is know to Fame; it's Adam, first of mortals.
For quiet's sake he makes a break from Eve, which is his Madame. . . .
Well, there's the gate; To crash it straight, just spy the guy that's Adam.""
The old Sourdough went down the row of greybeards ruminatin'
With optics dim they peered at him, and pressed agin the gratin'.
In every face he sought some trace of our ancestral father;
But though he stared, he soon despaired the faintest clue to gather.
Then suddenly he whooped with glee: ""Ha! Ha! an inspiration.""
And to and fro along the row he ran with animation.
To Peter, bold he cried: ""Behold, all told there are eleven.
Suppose I fix on Number Six; say Boy! How's that for Heaven?""
""By gosh! you win,"" said Pete. ""Step in. But tell me how you chose him.
They're like as pins; all might be twins. There's nothing to disclose him.""
The Sourdough said: ""'Twas hard; my head was seething with commotion.
I felt a dunce; then all at once I had a gorgeous notion.
I stooped and peered beneath each beard that drooped like fleece of mutton.
My search was crowned. . . . That bird I found; ain't got no belly button.""","Hark to the Sourdough story, told at sixty below, when the pipes are lit and we smoke and spit                Into the campfire glow. A sourdough came to stake his claim in Heav'n one morning early. The bedrock burned, and so he turned, and climbed with footsteps fleeter, the stairway straight to Heaven's gate.","Historical Context 'A Sourdough Story' was initially published in Service's 1940 volume, Bar-Room Ballads, which was published after Service moved from country to country in Europe before finally arriving in California, in the United States, to settle for the remainder of World War Two. Although 'A Sourdough Story' was published several decades after Service left the Yukon for the final time, there is clear reference to his time there, beginning with the title of the poem. “Sourdough,” a kind of bread, was a term that began to be used to describe Alaskan and Yukon prospectors, the most experienced of whom began to carry bread starters to nourish them during the more difficult or distant areas searched through during the gold rush. So, a “sourdough story” is one told about a Klondike prospector, one of the many people Service would have met and befriended during his time in the Yukon. The biblical references throughout this poem are somewhat more numerous than the sourdough ones, though they are also as easy to follow. Saint Peter appears in this poem; historically, he was one of the twelve disciples of Jesus, and after Jesus' execution, became one of the forefront leaders of Christianity, making himself a significant aspect of the creation of the Christian Church, to a point where he is considered today to be its first Pope. The Christian Bible attributes a number of letters and writings to Peter, though there are many religious scholars who doubt the full extent of his authorship to the New Testament. Another important element of Peter's connection to Christianity is that he is seen as the “gatekeeper” to Heaven; tradition suggests that souls that pass away will be unable to enter Heaven unless Saint Peter allows them entry. This is based on an account of a conversation between Jesus and Peter recorded in the Book of Matthew in the Christian Bible. Peter's role in 'A Sourdough Story' reflects his position as Heaven's gatekeeper."

The speaker wants to be a meaningful part of his life by doing splendid things for him. All he has is his heart-warming poetic art that can paint his sky blue.

73,"Ay, tear her tattered ensign down!
Long has it waved on high,
And many an eye has danced to see
That banner in the sky;
Beneath it rung the battle shout,
And burst the cannon’s roar;—
The meteor of the ocean air
Shall sweep the clouds no more!
Her deck, once red with heroes’ blood
Where knelt the vanquished foe,
When winds were hurrying o’er the flood
And waves were white below,
No more shall feel the victor’s tread,
Or know the conquered knee;—
The harpies of the shore shall pluck
The eagle of the sea!
O, better that her shattered hulk
Should sink beneath the wave;
Her thunders shook the mighty deep,
And there should be her grave;
Nail to the mast her holy flag,
Set every thread-bare sail,
And give her to the god of storms,—
The lightning and the gale!","Ay, tear her tattered ensign down! tear down! down! her deck, once red with heroes’ blood, where knelt the vanquished foe, when winds were hurrying o’er the flood, and waves were white below. No more shall feel the victor’s tread, or know the conquered knee;— the harpies of the shore shall pluck the eagle of the sea!","Old Ironsides' by Oliver Wendell Holmes speaks on the glory of the USS Constitution on the eve of its decommissioning. The poem begins with the speaker agreeing that the ship should be decommissioned. He asks that the “ensign” be torn down and eventually nailed to the mast of the ship. The Constitution has sailed for too long and seen too much. It is time for the battles of the past to be put to rest and for the ship to find a grave on the bottom of the sea. While the speaker's words seem passionate, it is clear the poet has the opposite goal in mind. He is actually, through the honouring of the ship, campaigning for its preservation and continuation in the service. By the end of the piece, a reader should come to the same conclusion; that the ship's history is too important to ignore and that it must be allowed to remain on the sea."
74,"Swerving east, from rich industrial shadows
And traffic all night north; swerving through fields
Too thin and thistled to be called meadows,
And now and then a harsh—named halt, that shields
Workmen at dawn; swerving to solitude
Of skies and scarecrows, haystacks, hares and pheasants,
And the widening river’s slow presence,
The piled gold clouds, the shining gull—marked mud,
 
Gathers to the surprise of a large town:
Here domes and statues, spires and cranes cluster
Beside grain—scattered streets, barge—crowded water,
And residents from raw estates, brought down
The dead straight miles by stealing flat—faced trolleys,
Push through plate—glass swing doors to their desires —
Cheap suits, red kitchen—ware, sharp shoes, iced lollies,
Electric mixers, toasters, washers, driers—
 
A cut—price crowd, urban yet simple, dwelling
Where only salesmen and relations come
Within a terminate and fishy—smelling
Pastoral of ships up streets, the slave museum,
Tattoo—shops, consulates, grim head—scarfed wives;
And out beyond its mortgaged half—built edges
Fast—shadowed wheat—fields, running high as hedges,
Isolate villages, where removed lives
 
Loneliness clarifies. Here silence stands
Like heat. Here leaves unnoticed thicken,
Hidden weeds flower, neglected waters quicken,
Luminously—peopled air ascends;
And past the poppies bluish neutral distance
Ends the land suddenly beyond a beach
Of shapes and shingle. Here is unfenced existence:
Facing the sun, untalkative, out of reach.","Swerving east, from rich industrial shadows                And traffic all night north; swerving through fields                Too thin and thistled to be called meadows,                And now and then a harsh—named halt, that shields                Workmen at dawn; swerve to solitude.","‘Here‘ by Philip Larkin captures the evolving journey of the poet’s emotional connection to his surroundings. Progressing from urban shadows and bustling towns to isolated landscapes, the poem illustrates the poet’s evolving perception of places and belongingness. In the poem ‘Here,’ Philip Larkin, the poet embarks on a very detailed exploration of shifting landscapes and the emotional fervor they evoke. The poem begins amidst the urban hustle and industrial shadows before steering eastward to meager fields and solitary spaces. As dawn breaks, the scene transforms into a quaint town, where domes, statues, and barges intermingle with bustling streets. This town stands as a curious blend of simplicity and urbanity, where residents pursue their desires amidst the hum of commerce. Larkin’s skillful imagery captures the essence of a world in transition, where loneliness finds its voice amidst hidden beauty. As the poem, ‘Here‘ progresses, the urban ambiance gives way to an isolated existence. The verses reflect the tranquility that resides in these quieter surroundings — neglected waters coming to life, the air that was weighed down by so many people lifting up, and distant landscapes yielding to the sun’s embrace. Yet, even in this solitude, a stark sense of hope prevails. The imagery of an unfenced existence facing the unreachable sun encapsulates the unspoken distance between the self and the external world. Through its expertly crafted scenes and lyrical language, ‘Here’ becomes a poignant meditation on the interplay between changing landscapes, inner contemplation, and the perennial quest for connection."
75,"TIS a dull sight
To see the year dying,
When winter winds
Set the yellow wood sighing:
Sighing, O sighing!
When such a time cometh
I do retire
Into an old room
Beside a bright fire:
O, pile a bright fire!
And there I sit
Reading old things,
Of knights and lorn damsels,
While the wind sings—
O, drearily sings!
I never look out
Nor attend to the blast;
For all to be seen
Is the leaves falling fast:
Falling, falling!
But close at the hearth,
Like a cricket, sit I,
Reading of summer
And chivalry—
Gallant chivalry!
Then with an old friend
I talk of our youth—
How 'twas gladsome, but often
Foolish, forsooth:
But gladsome, gladsome!
Or, to get merry,
We sing some old rhyme
That made the wood ring again
In summer time—
Sweet summer time!
Then go we smoking,
Silent and snug:
Naught passes between us,
Save a brown jug—
Sometimes!
And sometimes a tear
Will rise in each eye,
Seeing the two old friends
So merrily—
So merrily!
And ere to bed
Go we, go we,
Down on the ashes
We kneel on the knee,
Praying together!
Thus, then, live I
Till, 'mid all the gloom,
By Heaven! the bold sun
Is with me in the room
Shining, shining!
Then the clouds part,
Swallows soaring between;
The spring is alive,
And the meadows are green!
I jump up like mad,
Break the old pipe in twain,
And away to the meadows,
The meadows again!","The author has written a book about his life. The book is called ""A Man of Words"" and is published by Penguin Books. It is published in English as ""The Man ofwords"" (with a foreword by William Makepeace Thackeray)","Old Song' by Edward FitzGerald describes a speaker depression over the long weeks of winter, and eventual joy over the coming spring. The poem begins with the speaker giving a brief description of the world outside his window. It is not something he wants to dwell on and only gives the reader enough detail for them to know it is winter, and the wind is blowing drearily. He decides to retreat to his room, by the fireplace, until the season is over. There is meets with a friend, reminisces on the past, drinks, smokes, and prays until finally summer returns. At the moment warmth enters back into the world the speaker runs like “mad” out into the meadows he has so desperately missed."

While it could simply be about a lover, I argue that the unconscious pull of love 'determined' suggests a motherly bond. The poem begins with 'I love you', and continues by examining why she has this emotion. The first stanza focuses on the 'natural order of things', the seasons and weather all flowing just because they must – a comparison Giovanni draws to her state of love. The second stanza focuses on the habits Giovanni has built throughout her life, with love slipping into her life and staying. The third stanza focuses on how happy Giovanni is to be in love, idolising her child's voice and how their presence makes her feel. The fourth stanza explores the safety a relationship provides, Giovanni enjoying waking up and finding her child there in the morning. The final stanza discusses how they met, with the baby seeing Giovanni and 'decided that I [Giovanni] would love you', relating to the natural order of loving your child, and how Giovanni's whole life has changed because of it."

Her mother has brought her to see the body of her recently deceased cousin. She observes the portraits of royalty hanging around the body and speculates that they have called him to you to be the youngest page in court. Also near the body stands a stuffed loon, sitting on a “marble-topped table.” The speaker describes how the body appears, how he was “all white, like a doll” and “Jack Frost had started to paint him.” At the conclusion of the poem the speaker expresses concern over how Arthur will make it to court with the royals with his “eyes shut up so tight.”"
78,"Little Lamb who made thee
Dost thou know who made thee
Gave thee life & bid thee feed.

Making all the vales rejoice!

The lamb is a universal symbol of selfless innocence, Jesus the Lamb is the gentle imagination, the Divine Humanity. The Lamb identifies with Christ to form a Trinity of child, Lamb, and Redeemer. Throughout the two stanzas of this poem, the poet speaks to the lamb, asking it if it knows who was responsible for creating it. He goes into vague detail about Christ, his nature, while using repetition to emphasize these features."
79,"He climbed toward the blinding light
and when his eyes adjusted
he looked down and could see

his fellow prisoners captivated
by shadows; everything he had believed
was false. And he was suddenly

in the 20th century, in the sunlight
and violence of history, encumbered
by knowledge. Only a hero

would dare return with the truth.
So from the cave's upper reaches,
removed from harm, he called out

the disturbing news.
What lovely echoes, the prisoners said,
what a fine musical place to live.

He spelled it out, then, in clear prose
on paper scraps, which he floated down.
But in the semi-dark they read his words

with the indulgence of those who seldom read:
It's about my father's death, one of them said.
No, said the others, it's a joke.

By this time he no longer was sure
of what he'd seen. Wasn't sunlight a shadow too?
Wasn't there always a source

behind a source? He just stood there,
confused, a man who had moved
to larger errors, without a prayer.","He climbed toward the blinding light. He looked down and could see his fellow prisoners captivated by shadows. He spelled it out, then, in clear prose, on paper scraps, which he floated down. But in the semi-dark they read his words with the indulgence of those who seldom read.","'Allegory of the Cave' by Stephen Dunn describes a cave dweller's search for the “real” and his reaction after encountering the harsh reality. This piece directly begins with the episode where one of the cave dwellers (in Plato's allegory, the philosopher or the greatest individual) attempts to break the shackles of darkness and face the sun or the light of knowledge. The piercing light not only blinds his eyes but also teaches him something greater than he previously believed in. Besides, he learns the ravages of history and where the world is leading. When he tries to communicate the message to other dwellers, they find it quite unbelievable and false. It makes him question even the reality around him."
80,"And God stepped out on space,
And he looked around and said:
I'm lonely—
I'll make me a world.
And far as the eye of God could see
Darkness covered everything,
Blacker than a hundred midnights
Down in a cypress swamp.
Then God smiled,
And the light broke,
And the darkness rolled up on one side,
And the light stood shining on the other,
And God said: That's good!
Then God reached out and took the light in his hands,
And God rolled the light around in his hands
Until he made the sun;
And he set that sun a-blazing in the heavens.
And the light that was left from making the sun
God gathered it up in a shining ball
And flung it against the darkness,
Spangling the night with the moon and stars.
Then down between
The darkness and the light
He hurled the world;
And God said: That's good!
Then God himself stepped down—
And the sun was on his right hand,
And the moon was on his left;
The stars were clustered about his head,
And the earth was under his feet.
And God walked, and where he trod
His footsteps hollowed the valleys out
And bulged the mountains up.
Then he stopped and looked and saw
That the earth was hot and barren.
So God stepped over to the edge of the world
And he spat out the seven seas—
He batted his eyes, and the lightnings flashed—
He clapped his hands, and the thunders rolled—
And the waters above the earth came down,
The cooling waters came down.
Then the green grass sprouted,
And the little red flowers blossomed,
The pine tree pointed his finger to the sky,
And the oak spread out his arms,
The lakes cuddled down in the hollows of the ground,
And the rivers ran down to the sea;
And God smiled again,
And the rainbow appeared,
And curled itself around his shoulder.
Then God raised his arm and he waved his hand
Over the sea and over the land,
And he said: Bring forth! Bring forth!
And quicker than God could drop his hand,
Fishes and fowls
And beasts and birds
Swam the rivers and the seas,
Roamed the forests and the woods,
And split the air with their wings.
And God said: That's good!
Then God walked around,
And God looked around
On all that he had made.
He looked at his sun,
And he looked at his moon,
And he looked at his little stars;
He looked on his world
With all its living things,
And God said: I'm lonely still.
Then God sat down—
On the side of a hill where he could think;
By a deep, wide river he sat down;
With his head in his hands,
God thought and thought,
Till he thought: I'll make me a man!
Up from the bed of the river
God scooped the clay;
And by the bank of the river
He kneeled him down;
And there the great God Almighty
Who lit the sun and fixed it in the sky,
Who flung the stars to the most far corner of the night,
Who rounded the earth in the middle of his hand;
This great God,
Like a mammy bending over her baby,
Kneeled down in the dust
Toiling over a lump of clay
Till he shaped it in is his own image;
Then into it he blew the breath of life,
And man became a living soul.
Amen. Amen.","And God stepped out on space, and he looked around and said:   I'm lonely—                I'll make me a world. And far as the eye of God could see, darkness covered everything. But God smiled, and the light broke. And the darkness rolled up on one side,                And the light stood shining on the other.","'The Creation' by James Weldon Johnson is a retelling of the story of Genesis. This poem depicts a human-like image of God, the man behind the creation. This poem starts with a sense of continuity. According to the poet, God might have felt lonely. For this reason, he created the earth. But, he was not satisfied until he made humans. In the body of the poem, readers can find how God made this creation bit by bit. Firstly, he brought light into the world by creating, sun, moon, and stars. Thereafter he cooled the temperature of the earth by creating rain and made several creatures fill the space with the spontaneity of life. After this long process, he thought he would be happy. But, he was not. Hence, he created humans from the “lump of clay.”"
81,"If all the world and love were young,
And truth in every Shepherd’s tongue,
These pretty pleasures might me move,
To live with thee, and be thy love.

Time drives the flocks from field to fold,
When Rivers rage and Rocks grow cold,
And Philomel becometh dumb,
The rest complains of cares to come.

The flowers do fade, and wanton fields,
To wayward winter reckoning yields,
A honey tongue, a heart of gall,
Is fancy’s spring, but sorrow’s fall.

Thy cap, thy kirtle, and thy posies
Soon break, soon wither, soon forgotten:
In folly ripe, in reason rotten.

Thy belt of straw and Ivy buds,
The Coral clasps and amber studs,
All these in me no means can move
To come to thee and be thy love.

But could youth last, and love still breed,
Had joys no date, nor age no need,
Then these delights my mind might move
To live with thee, and be thy love.","If all the world and love were young, and truth in every Shepherd’s tongue,These pretty pleasures might me move,                To live with thee, and be thy love.

Throughout this poem, the nymph describes how time, pleasure, and all possessions, are fleeting. These joys won't last forever, nor will impetuous choices and sweet words. All of these things are like “spring” to “fall”. They might be beautiful now but when it comes time for the season to change they are going to fade like everything else."
82,"I marvel how Nature could ever find space
For so many strange contrasts in one human face:
There's thought and no thought, and there's paleness and bloom
And bustle and sluggishness, pleasure and gloom.

There's weakness, and strength both redundant and vain;
Such strength as, if ever affliction and pain
Could pierce through a temper that's soft to disease,
Would be rational peace--a philosopher's ease.

There's indifference, alike when he fails or succeeds,
And attention full ten times as much as there needs;
Pride where there's no envy, there's so much of joy;
And mildness, and spirit both forward and coy.

There's freedom, and sometimes a diffident stare
Of shame scarcely seeming to know that she's there,
There's virtue, the title it surely may claim,
Yet wants heaven knows what to be worthy the name.

This picture from nature may seem to depart,
Yet the Man would at once run away with your heart;
And I for five centuries right gladly would be
Such an odd such a kind happy creature as he.","I marvel how Nature could ever find space for so many strange contrasts in one human face.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that “Nature” has found a way to imbue the face of “man” with an endless array of emotions. He is able to read these emotions and sees them as being both contrasting and complementary. The speaker points out “thought and no thought” as well as “pleasure and gloom.” In the following lines, the speaker moves from describing all of humanity to a small portion he calls “man.” This word ends up standing in for a particular type of man he fears will run away with his listener's heart. It is his goal with this piece to expose the flaws in their moral character and steer her away from them and towards him."
83,"She kept an antique shop – or it kept her.
Among Apostle spoons and Bristol glass,
The faded silks, the heavy furniture,
She watched her own reflection in the brass
Salvers and silver bowls, as if to prove
Polish was all, there was no need of love.
And I remember how I once refused
To go out with her, since I was afraid.
It was perhaps a wish not to be used
Like antique objects. Though she never said
That she was hurt, I still could feel the guilt
Of that refusal, guessing how she felt.

Later, too frail to keep a shop, she put
All her best things in one narrow room.
The place smelt old, of things too long kept shut,
The smell of absences where shadows come
That can’t be polished. There was nothing then
To give her own reflection back again.

And when she died I felt no grief at all,
Only the guilt of what I once refused.
I walked into her room among the tall
Sideboards and cupboards – things she never used
But needed; and no finger marks were there,
Only the new dust falling through the air.","She kept an antique shop – or it kept her. Among Apostle spoons and Bristol glass, the faded silks, the heavy furniture.

The poem begins with the speaker describing the antique shop that her grandmother used to have. In the shop, she would collect and polish items that the speaker found a little value in. The speaker also recalls a time when her grandmother invited her out on a shopping trip, something that she refused. To this day, she still feels guilt over this refusal. Eventually, the grandmother becomes too frail to care for her shop and has to close it. She moves a few items she's able to into a narrow room in her home. She dies, and the speaker is left walking through her possessions and considering her grandmother's life."
84,"Swiftly walk o'er the western wave,
Spirit of Night!
Out of the misty eastern cave,
Where, all the long and lone daylight,
Thou wovest dreams of joy and fear,
Which make thee terrible and dear,—
Swift be thy flight!
Wrap thy form in a mantle gray,
Star-inwrought!
Blind with thine hair the eyes of Day;
Kiss her until she be wearied out,
Then wander o'er city, and sea, and land,
Touching all with thine opiate wand—
Come, long-sought!
When I arose and saw the dawn,
I sighed for thee;
When light rode high, and the dew was gone,
And noon lay heavy on flower and tree,
And the weary Day turned to his rest,
Lingering like an unloved guest.
I sighed for thee.
Thy brother Death came, and cried,
Wouldst thou me?
Thy sweet child Sleep, the filmy-eyed,
Murmured like a noontide bee,
Shall I nestle near thy side?
Wouldst thou me?—And I replied,
No, not thee!
Death will come when thou art dead,
Soon, too soon—
Sleep will come when thou art fled;
Of neither would I ask the boon
I ask of thee, belovèd Night—
Swift be thine approaching flight,
Come soon, soon!","Swiftly walk o'er the western wave, the Spirit of Night!                Out of the misty eastern cave!                Thou wovest dreams of joy and fear, which make thee terrible and dear.                Swift be thy flight!                Wrap thy form in a mantle gray,                Star-inwrought!                Blind with thine hair the eyes of Day!                Kiss her until she be wearied out,                Touching all withThou opiate wand!","To Night Analysis Swiftly walk o'er the western wave, Spirit of Night! Out of the misty eastern cave, Where, all the long and lone daylight, Thou wovest dreams of joy and fear, Which make thee terrible and dear,— Swift be thy flight! The poet here makes an appeal to Night which has been personified. Night seems to the poet to be a living being, capable of acting in accordance with its own will and capable of listening to the poet. Shelly has, therefore, created a myth here. He appeals to Night to spread itself over the western sky where the sun sets. He imagines that Night spends the hours of daylight in some misty eastern cave, all alone, and that it keeps busy during that time, manufacturing or weaving dreams of joy and fear for human beings. These dreams are seen by human beings during their sleep. Sweet dreams, which human beings see, make Night dear to them; but the frightening dreams, which they see, make Night terrible to them. Thus, human beings are in love with Night and yet, at the same time, they are afraid of Night. The poet is in love with Night without being afraid of it. He wants Night to come swiftly and without delay. Wrap thy form in a mantle gray, Star-inwrought! The poet calls upon Night to wrap itself in a gray-colored cloak which has stars woven in its texture. The dark sky is regarded here as the mantle of Night and the stars that shine in the sky are supposed to be woven in the texture of that mantle. Blind with thine hair the eyes of Day; Kiss her until she be wearied out, Here Day is also personified. The poet asks Night to come and spread its black hair over the eyes of Day, so that Day may no longer be able to see. Then the poet asks Night to overwhelm Day with kisses. Let Day be kissed so vehemently and repeatedly that Day feels tired of these kisses and flees from the world. This is a poetic fancy. What the poet means is that, with the coming of Night, Day withdraws from this world. Then wander o'er city, and sea, and land, Touching all with thine opiate wand— Come, long-sought! We are to imagine that Night carries in its hand magic staffs, which has the power of sending everyone, who is touched with it, to sleep. When Night comes, all creatures fall asleep. When I arose and saw the dawn, I sighed for thee; When light rode high, and the dew was gone, And noon lay heavy on flower and tree, And the weary Day turned to his rest, Lingering like an unloved guest. I sighed for thee. When Day was tired of its stay on the earth, it felt like resting. And yet Day stayed on for some time more, just as a guest might prolong his stay in a house where he is no longer welcome. Here is the use of simile (Lingering like an unloved guest) is made very appropriately. Thy brother Death came, and cried, Wouldst thou me? Thy sweet child Sleep, the filmy-eyed, Murmured like a noontide bee, Shall I nestle near thy side? Wouldst thou me?—And I replied, No, not thee! The poet is interested neither in Death nor in Sleep. He looks upon Death as the brother of Night, and he calls Sleep a child of Night. Death is also the brother of Night because Night stands for darkness, and Death takes human beings into the unknown dark region. Sleep is the child of Night because it is during night that human beings are overcome by Sleep. Both Death and Sleep offer to come to him. Death is prepared to take him away from this world in case he is sick of life. Sleep, which makes the eyelids close, speaks to the poet every sweetly and softly like the murmuring of a bee at noon-time. Sleep offers to creep close to the poet and to send him into a state of temporary forgetfulness. But the poet rejects both these offers, because he is attracted only by Night. Death will come when thou art dead, Soon, too soon— Sleep will come when thou art fled; Of neither would I ask the boon I ask of thee, belovèd Night— Swift be thine approaching flight, Come soon, soon! Death would come to the poet in its own time. It would not take long in coming to the poet. (Here is an unconscious prophecy of Shelley's premature death. It was at the age of 29 that he was drowned in the sea). The poet does not accept the offer of Sleep, because Sleep can come to him when Night is gone. He would not like to waste his time in sleeping. He can sleep permanently after death."

Weak wretched sinner though I be,

O Let Me Call Thee Mine!' by Anne Brontë is a spiritual poem portraying a person's ultimate desire to please God, despite their little faith and great fears. 'My God! O Let Me Call Thee Mine!' kicks off with the persona's passionate cry to God. The poet persona asks that they and God belong to each other as lovers do. The speaker goes on to outline reasons they are undeserving of God—those reasons being their weak faith, dark pasts, sinful nature, and anxiety about the future. Nonetheless, their request remains because they believe God's presence in their life can fix those issues. As the poem progresses, the speaker alternates these two “prayer points”: reverencing God than asking He relieves them of their worries. The persona concludes with a final request that God makes them live in a way that pleases Him, not themselves. Although the speaker says their faith is weak, they, no doubt, believe firmly in God. Their anxiety about the future and grief from the past challenge their faith throughout the poem. However, that faith persists, as seen in the speaker's tone and mood at the poem's conclusion."

The poem takes the reader through several amusing statements about the nature of very basic things. These include flowers, bread, and stars. He asserts that he is troubled by their nature. They are too red, too full of bread, and too bright. The obvious humour in these lines is made meaningful in the last stanza when he describes the trouble he has with himself. This is where the reader comes to understand the main themes of this piece and their commentary on one's opinion of one's self."

Blew into air; then, hearing us beside,

He was alone and blinded by war. There are no details about who he was, where he fought, or what happened that made him lose his eyes. A few young soldiers came up to him and asked for his advice. He gave it, sharing something of the horrors he encountered. 

At the end of ‘The Veteran’ Cole surprises the reader by revealing, through the veteran’s words, that he is only eighteen. It’s only after concluding the poem that a reader can assess the themes. They include age, experience, and of course, war."

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker asks several rhetorical questions in regard to how much more there is for him to write about his love. He's written so much and knows that he's touched on every possible subject. Despite this, he isn't bored. He continues to write, taking just as much pleasure from the process as ever. He and his lover, the Fair Youth, belong to one another in the same way they did when their love was young. He intends for that to remain the same as they both age, and outward appearances suggest that their love should be “dead.”"
89,"Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.

All the animals that had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.

They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster. You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.

Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together…","When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge.

90,"Like a sculptor chipping away at bits of wood,
Time chisels away bits of their memory
It strips away lyrics of the women of my Land
Leaving only a fading tune echoing the song,
they sang in the forlorn fields
about their lives; songs
of how they ploughed the terrain of their landscape
for memories of lyrics lost in the vast void of time,
in those days when a song beheld their lives;
when servitude cuffed the ankles of their soul,
and dereliction decapitated the epic of their lives.
With a song, they sponged off their anguish,
to behold their collective pain,
to celebrate their gains,
give lyrics to the tune of their lives,
cheat the tyranny of tit
and commune with the yet unborn
to give meaning to an epoch lost in antiquity,
Yet time strips the lyrics and scars the tune,
leaving a dying song.

Who ploughed their soil and soul

left in the memory of my mind.
Now feeding the verses of poets, it echoes in
Wriggling in the rhythms and melodies,
Hollering in distant tunes
In places far afield the forlorn fields,
where the song of their lives died.
The stuttering lips of my pen
And the screeching voice of my rib
try to sing the song of the women of my Land
In verses far from the theatre of toil
where they left a song that now roams the land
stripped of lyrics like a scorned ghost.

The poem begins with the poet utilizing similes and metaphors to speak on the way that time is able to chip away at memory and experiences. It has done its job on the “memory” of the women of his land, Sierra Leone, and now it is stripping away the “lyrics of the song” they used to sing. In the past, their individual experiences came together to form a unifying, uplifting tune that helped them fight back emotionally and mentally against the oppression and slavery they were enduring. Time has taken its toll though, and the song is slowly being lost to the ages, just as these women were. Now, all that's left is a tune that, through personification, is able to wander the “forlorn fields”. It searches out someone who might hear and appreciate it. Luckily, it appears that some do. It is there as inspiration for poets to write new songs based around its sound, just as Farouk wrote this one."
91,"Darkness came early, though not yet cold;
Stars were strung on the telegraph wires;
Street lamps spilled pools of liquid gold;
The breeze was spiced with garden fires.
That smell of burnt leaves, the early dark.
Can still excite me but not as it did
So long ago when we met in the park-
Myself, John Peters and David Kidd.
We moved out of town to the district where
The lucky and wealthy had their homes
with garages, gardens and apples to spare
Clustered in the trees' green domes
We chose the place we meant to plunder
And climbed the wall and tip-toed through
The secret dark. Apples crunched under Our feet as we moved through the grass and dew.
We found the lower boughs of a tree
That were easy to reach. We stored the fruit
in pockets and jerseys until all three
Boys were heavy with their tasty loot.
Safe on the other side of the wall
We moved back to town and munched as we went.
I wonder if David remembers at all That little adventure, the apples' fresh scent?
Strange to think that he's fifty years old,
That though little boy with scabs on his knees;
Stranger to think that John Pieters lies cold
In an orchard in France beneath apple trees.","John Pieters grew up in an orchard in France beneath apple trees. He now lives in London with his wife and two children. Pieters is currently working on a book about his time in France. The book will be published in 2015. For more information on the book, visit www.thebookshop.co.uk.","'The Apple-Raid' by Vernon Scannell describes how the poet along with his friends John Peters and David Kidd stealthily entered into the gardens to collect apples during Autumn. This piece begins with a reference to the external ambiance. It was the season of autumn. The speaker of this poem recalls how the breeze spiced with garden fires, the smell of burnt leaves, and the early dark excited him when he was a child. Then he gathered in the park with his friends John and David. The kids went out of town to the district where wealthy families lived. They went there to collect apples in the secret dark. After gathering apples, they stepped outside silently as they entered and moved out of town munching their raided items. Now David is fifty and his childish spirit has dimmed. In the case of John, he is no more. Ironically, his grave can be found in a French orchard beneath apple boughs."
92,"My heart leaps up when I behold A rainbow in the sky:
So was it when my life began; So is it now I am a man; So be it when I shall grow old, Or let me die!
The Child is father of the Man;
And I could wish my days to be
Bound each to each by natural piety.","My heart leaps up when I behold A rainbow in the sky. So is it now I am a man; So be it when I shall grow old, Or let me die! The Child is father of the Man;And I could wish my days to be bound each to each by natural piety.","'My Heart Leaps Up' by William Wordsworth centers on a rainbow, a symbol of nature and how the poet wishes to keep his childlike self alive. This poem begins with a reference to a rainbow. Whenever Wordsworth beholds it, his heart gets filled with enthusiasm and energy. It is not that the sensation of joy existed in his heart when he was a child. As an adult, he still enjoys the beauty of a rainbow. He wishes to retain this childish self even if he matures and grows old. If it does not happen, he will embrace death unquestionably. According to him, nature, symbolized by the rainbow, will always be divine, and he thinks it should be for everyone."
93,"Remember the time you lent me your car and I dented it?

The poem begins with the speaker describing how she got into a car accident. She feared that her partner would be furious with her for what happened, but that was not the case. He surprised her with his kind reaction. The same formula plays out over the following stanzas as the speaker presents a memory of a mistake she made and the pleasantly measured reaction she got from her husband. It is in the fourth stanza that the true nature of the poem is revealed. She is not bringing these memories back to the forefront for sentimental reasons or to make some grand gesture, but as a kind of catharsis. Glass informs the reader that her husband died, having not returned from Vietnam. This means she was never able to acknowledge all that he did for her."

Anything can be, anything can be. I'm not saying anything is impossible, I'm just saying it can't be.","'Listen to the MUSTN'TS' by Shel Silverstein describes all the negativity a child will face in their life and encourages them to ignore these voices. The poem begins with the speaker telling the child that they must take the time to listen to all the naysayers in the world. There are the “MUSTN'TS” and the “DONT'S” as well as the “WONT'S.” All of these people will tell the child that what they want can't and should not occur. The child needs to hear them, and then push their voices aside so they can get on with making everything they want to happen."

Williams is fascinated by this process, drawing similarities with the human practice of putting on and taking off clothes. The use of personification throughout the poem gives Winter Trees a friendly and comforting sense. The excitement present in Williams' writing makes it appear as if he is friends with the trees, happy to watch them grow and change. The poem ends with the trees going to sleep, ready to pass through the winter. "
96,"What need you, being come to sense,
But fumble in a greasy till
And add the halfpence to the pence
And prayer to shivering prayer, until
You have dried the marrow from the bone;
For men were born to pray and save:
Romantic Ireland’s dead and gone,
It’s with O’Leary in the grave.
Yet they were of a different kind,
The names that stilled your childish play,
They have gone about the world like wind,
But little time had they to pray
For whom the hangman’s rope was spun,
And what, God help us, could they save?
Romantic Ireland’s dead and gone,
It’s with O’Leary in the grave.
Was it for this the wild geese spread
The grey wing upon every tide;
For this that all that blood was shed,
For this Edward Fitzgerald died,
And Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone,
All that delirium of the brave?
Romantic Ireland’s dead and gone,
It’s with O’Leary in the grave.
Yet could we turn the years again,
And call those exiles as they were
In all their loneliness and pain,
You’d cry, ‘Some woman’s yellow hair
Has maddened every mother’s son’:
They weighed so lightly what they gave.
But let them be, they’re dead and gone,
They’re with O’Leary in the grave.","'Romantic Ireland’s dead and gone, with O’Leary in the grave' 'For men were born to pray and save' 'They weighed so lightly what they gave' 'But let them be, they’re dead and Gone, they're with O'Leary inThe grave'","'September 1913' by William Butler Yeats is a mournful elegy for “Romantic Ireland” and the nationalist heroes that Yeats admired. The poem takes the reader through Yeats' perception of the current state of Irish politics and the beliefs of the general public. He feels disdain towards those who have no regard for the past and don't remember what was lost. Yeats thinks that all the strength of his country has been zapped and all its people have turned inward. The poet mourns for a bygone era in which heroes worked for the greater good, but he admits that it is lost. He gives up on it ever coming back."
97,"Lately, I've become accustomed to the way
The ground opens up and envelopes me
Each time I go out to walk the dog.
Or the broad edged silly music the wind
Makes when I run for a bus . . .

Things have come to that.

And now, each night I count the stars,
And each night I get the same number.
And when they will not come to be counted,
I count the holes they leave.



Nobody sings anymore.

And then last night, I tiptoed up
To my daughter's room and heard her
Talking to someone, and when I opened
The door, there was no one there . . .
Only she on her knees, peeking into

Her own clasped hands.","Lately, I've become accustomed to the way the ground opens up and envelopes me. Each night I count the stars,                And each night I get the same number.

The speaker of this poem comes across a number of challenges in his day-to-day life. When he goes out to walk his dog, he feels like the ground beneath his feet is enveloping him. Even the wind mocks him when he runs to catch a bus. He usually counts the stars at night, and the gross total interestingly remains the same each day. If there is an absence, he starts counting the holes or gaps. On the final night, he found his daughter talking to herself. He felt so lonely that he probably took his life that night."
98,"When God at first made man,
Having a glass of blessings standing by,
“Let us,” said he, “pour on him all we can.
Let the world’s riches, which dispersèd lie,
Contract into a span.”

So strength first made a way;
Then beauty flowed, then wisdom, honour, pleasure.
When almost all was out, God made a stay,
Perceiving that, alone of all his treasure,
Rest in the bottom lay.

“For if I should,” said he,
“Bestow this jewel also on my creature,
He would adore my gifts instead of me,
And rest in Nature, not the God of Nature;
So both should losers be.

“Yet let him keep the rest,
But keep them with repining restlessness;
Let him be rich and weary, that at least,
If goodness lead him not, yet weariness
May toss him to my breast.”","When God at first made man, he said: “Let us,” said he, “pour on him all we can’t let the world’s riches, which dispersèd lie, contract into a span.” So strength first made a way; then beauty flowed, then wisdom, honour, pleasure.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is retelling the story of creation. He is particularly interested in the part where God gives humankind knowledge, wisdom, beauty, and strength. These are important features of human existence that flowed easily from God to humankind. There is one blessing that God did not let out of his cup, rest. He chose to withhold an innate ability to rest from humankind in order to keep his creation close to him. When one gets weary, they turn to God. Or that is his reasoning. Herbert's speaker states that God did not want humanity to love Nature more than they love “the God of Nature.”"

100,"May this be the day

We come together.

Mourning, we come to mend,

Withered, we come to weather,

Torn, we come to tend,

Battered, we come to better.

Tethered by this year of yearning,

We are learning

That though we weren't ready for this,

We have been readied by it.

We steadily vow that no matter

How we are weighed down,

We must always pave a way forward.

*

This hope is our door, our portal.

Even if we never get back to normal,

Someday we can venture beyond it,

To leave the known and take the first steps.

So let us not return to what was normal,

But reach toward what is next.

*

What was cursed, we will cure.

What was plagued, we will prove pure.

Where we tend to argue, we will try to agree,

Those fortunes we forswore, now the future we foresee,

Where we weren't aware, we're now awake;

Those moments we missed

Are now these moments we make,

The moments we meet,

And our hearts, once altogether beaten,

Now all together beat.

*

Come, look up with kindness yet,

For even solace can be sourced from sorrow.

We remember, not just for the sake of yesterday,

But to take on tomorrow.

*

We heed this old spirit,

In a new day's lyric,

In our hearts, we hear it:

For auld lang syne, my dear,

For auld lang syne.

Be bold, sang Time this year,

Be bold, sang Time,

For when you honor yesterday,

Tomorrow ye will find.

Know what we've fought

Need not be forgot nor for none.

Come over, join this day just begun.

For wherever we come together,

We will forever overcome.","May this be the day that we come together. We are learning that though we weren't ready for this, we have been readied by it.

In the first lines of this poem, the speaker begins by saying that the new year is time for everyone to set aside their differences and walk through the door of hope together. She hopes that this will allow the world to change for the better. But, this doesn't mean one should forget the suffering of recent years and the long past. One's “yesterday” can help fuel one's decisions for tomorrow."
101,"Home is so sad. It stays as it was left,
Shaped to the comfort of the last to go
As if to win them back. Instead, bereft
Of anyone to please, it withers so,
Having no heart to put aside the theft

A joyous shot at how things ought to be,
Long fallen wide. You can see how it was:
Look at the pictures and the cutlery.
The music in the piano stool. That vase.","Home is so sad. It stays as it was left, shaped to the comfort of the last to go. You can see how it was: look at the pictures and the cutlery. That vase. The music in the piano stool. The vase in the living room.","Home is so Sad' by Philip Larkin is a touching ten-line poem that describes what happens to a home when people begin to leave it behind. The poem uses personification to describe the home as a suffering creature, something that has lost what it loved and would do anything to bring it back. There is a comforting space it fosters for whoever left it behind. It's always ready to allow that person back in. In the second stanza, the speaker notes some of the variety of images that mark change and loss in a home."

The poem is one of the harsher, more direct in the series. In it, the speaker once again accuses the youth of being a murderer for not wanting to have a child. He tells the young man that everyone loves him and that he should have a child, if not for their sake or his, then for the speaker. It would allow his beauty to persevere in another after he dies.

103,"Ah, what can ail thee, wretched wight,
Alone and palely loitering;
The sedge is withered from the lake,
And no birds sing.

Ah, what can ail thee, wretched wight,
So haggard and so woe-begone?
The squirrel's granary is full,
And the harvest's done.

I see a lilly on thy brow,
With anguish moist and fever dew;
And on thy cheek a fading rose
Fast withereth too.

I met a lady in the meads
Full beautiful, a faery's child;
Her hair was long, her foot was light,
And her eyes were wild.

I set her on my pacing steed,
And nothing else saw all day long;
For sideways would she lean, and sing
A faery's song.

I made a garland for her head,
And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;
She looked at me as she did love,
And made sweet moan.

She found me roots of relish sweet,
And honey wild, and manna dew;
And sure in language strange she said,
I love thee true.

She took me to her elfin grot,
And there she gazed and sighed deep,
And there I shut her wild sad eyes—
So kissed to sleep.

And there we slumbered on the moss,
And there I dreamed, ah woe betide,
The latest dream I ever dreamed
On the cold hill side.

I saw pale kings, and princes too,
Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;
Who cried—""La belle Dame sans merci
Hath thee in thrall!""

I saw their starved lips in the gloam
With horrid warning gaped wide,
And I awoke, and found me here
On the cold hill side.

And this is why I sojourn here
Alone and palely loitering,
Though the sedge is withered from the lake,
And no birds sing.","Ah, what can ail thee, wretched wight, so haggard and so woe-begone? The squirrel's granary is full, and the harvest's done.

The first three stanzas introduce the unidentified speaker and the knight. The speaker comes across the knight wandering around in the dead of winter when “the sedge has withered from the lake/ And no birds sing.” In this way, Keats depicts a barren and bleak landscape. The knight responds to the speaker, telling him how he met a lady in the meadows who was “full beautiful, a faery’s child”. Here, Keats’ language sweetens. The first three stanzas were bitter and devoid of emotion, but the introduction of the “lady in the meads” produces softness in the language of the knight. He reminisces on the lady’s beauty and her apparent innocence – her long hair, light feet, and wild eyes – and on her otherworldliness, as well. Moreover, he describes his sweet memories of the Lady: feeding each other, giving her presents, traveling with her, and being together."
104,"(My student, thrown by a horse)

I remember the neckcurls, limp and damp as tendrils;
And her quick look, a sidelong pickerel smile;
And how, once started into talk, the light syllables leaped for her.
And she balanced in the delight of her thought,
A wren, happy, tail into the wind,
Her song trembling the twigs and small branches.
The shade sang with her;
The leaves, their whispers turned to kissing,
And the mould sang in the bleached valleys under the rose.

Oh, when she was sad, she cast herself down into such a pure depth,
Even a father could not find her:
Scraping her cheek against straw,
Stirring the clearest water.
My sparrow, you are not here,
Waiting like a fern, making a spiney shadow.
The sides of wet stones cannot console me,
Nor the moss, wound with the last light.

Neither father nor lover.","(My student, thrown by a horse) is the story of a young woman's life. The story is told through the eyes of a wren, a pigeon, a bird of prey and a maimed pigeon.

Throughout this poem, Roethke's speaker uses interesting and memorable images of nature to describe the life of one of his students, Jane. She died after being thrown from her horse and her loss has impacted him deeply. He did not love her as a father or as a lover but he feels in her death the loss of something integral. Since her bird-like presence has left the earth, he has found himself unable to take pleasure in the natural world. The poem ends without a resolution, he is still mourning her and has come to no conclusion about what his next steps should be."

The overview of life includes good things and bad things, proving that life is filled with varying elements that exist in both positive and negative states of being. At some points, in fact, it is hard to discern what the good and bad are within the poem’s situations, which helps to solidify this contrasting method of expressing differentiation. To Levertov, it seems, life is neither primarily filled with good or bad, but its “depths” are still worth “tast[ing].” This thought is the theme of the poem."

There are few details about this poem, but alternative versions do provide more child-friendly lines, removing the word “drunk” and its implications."
107,"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord:
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fatal lightning of his terrible swift sword:

They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;

“As ye deal with my contemners, so with you my grace shall deal;
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,

In this poem, the poet alludes to several biblical passages. The speaker depicts Christ as a savior who will bring peace again in this world. She can see him appearing in his glorious outlook to redeem mankind as he did before. But, this time he won't be too kind to those who previously wiped humanity from the face of the earth. According to the speaker, he is a warrior now, beaming with heroism and vibrant with vengeful energy. However, the portrayal of Christ as a hero and as a warrior hints at something else. Here, the poet tries to infuse the audience with the heroic energy of Christ. In this way, they can get justice for themselves. Jesus Christ is just a metaphor in their proclamation of resistance."
108,"Silent are the woods, and the dim green boughs are
Hushed in the twilight: yonder, in the path through
The apple orchard, is a tired plough-boy
Calling the cows home.

Still the red, lurid wreckage of the sunset
Smoulders in smoky fire, and burns on
The misty hill-tops.

Fades into smoke, and now the gusty oaks are
A silent army of phantoms thronging
A land of shadows.","Silent are the woods, and the dim green boughs are. The apple orchard is a tired plough-boy calling the cows home. The red, lurid wreckage of the sunset smoulders in smoky fire, and burns on the hill-tops.","‘On Eastnor Knoll’ by John Masefield elegantly and poetically depicts the end of the day and the setting of the sun below the horizon.
The poem takes the reader through a series of powerful images of the sunset, moonrise, and the casting of the world into shadow. Masefield uses a variety of poetic techniques to help the reader imagine what it was like to see that particular sunset and all other sunsets since time began."
109,"To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
For as you were when first your eye I eyed,
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
Have from the forests shook three summers’ pride,
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned
In process of the seasons have I seen,
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
Ah, yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,
Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived:
For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred:
Ere you were born was beauty’s summer dead.","To me, fair friend, you never can be old, for as you were when first your eye I eyed, such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold have from the forests shook three summers’ pride. Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned, since first I saw you fresh.","Sonnet 104, 'To me, fair friend, you never can be old,' by William Shakespeare addresses the facts of aging and the possibility that the Fair Youth is effected just as much as anyone else is. The poem is addressed to the Fair Youth, who is throughout the text complimented on his beauty. He seems not to have aged the whole time the speaker has known him. Over the last three years, he has remained just as fresh and green as when they first met. But, the speaker acknowledges towards the end, he knows this can't be the case. All people age and time moves so slowly that he just can't see it. The final two lines are addressed to future generations. He tells them that when they are alive, the most beautiful person to have ever lived will have already died."

The poem takes the reader through an emotional depiction of the world of dreams and the waking world. In the stanzas, the young woman who is singing them, describes the nature of Merciful Town and everyone's desire to lay down their tools and troubles and go there. It is a place where one can escape from their life, but, it is not always accessible."
111,"Beautiful man, milk teeth bared in a trap,
Whose mouth curls in despair,
She smiles at your face.
Beautiful man, twitching boy’s shoulders
Like many golden carp
Swimming to her gaze.
Beautiful man, your white skin turns redder,
Your slit eyes grow wide,
Your chin’s fuzzed with moth.
Beautiful man, fingers knifing, stab
Or roll, winding up thoughts
Like fine hair, like cloth.
Beautiful man, leaning back stock-still, now
Bunched in fury, fishy,
You play at the groom.

Your head pulls as the tide
Silvering the room.

She swallows her doubts.","Beautiful man, milk teeth bared in a trap,Whose mouth curls in despair,                She smiles at your face.                Beautiful. man, twitching boy’s shoulders.                Like many golden carp's shoulders                Swimming to her gaze.","'Mother's Song' by Shirley Lim is a touching poem that speaks on themes of love and motherhood and it depicts aging milestones in a man's life. The poem takes the reader through a series of images that imagine a baby in various stages of his future life. He grows, becoming a young, energetic boy. Soon though he's getting older and growing more distant from his mother. Eventually, he's playing at “groom” and getting crows feet and silver hair."
112,"That night the moon drifted over the pond, turning the water to milk, and under the boughs of the trees, the blue trees, a young woman walked, and for an instant
the future came to her:
rain falling on her husband’s grave, rain falling on the lawns of her children, her own mouth
filling with cold air, strangers moving into her house,
a man in her room writing a poem, the moon drifting into it, a woman strolling under its trees, thinking of death,
thinking of him thinking of her, and the wind rising
and taking the moon and leaving the paper dark.","That night the moon drifted over the pond, turning the water to milk, and under the boughs of the trees, the blue trees, a young woman walked.

This piece begins with an image of a moonlit night, and the moon drifted over a pond, making the water white. On such a wonderful night, a young woman walked alone. Suddenly, the future flashed before her eyes. She could see a similar scene reflected in a poem written by a man sitting in her room. In the image, the moon hides behind the clouds, leaving his paper utterly dark."
113,"The curtains were half drawn, the floor was swept
And strewn with rushes, rosemary and may
Lay thick upon the bed on which I lay,
Where through the lattice ivy-shadows crept.
He leaned above me, thinking that I slept
And could not hear him; but I heard him say,
‘Poor child, poor child’: and as he turned away
Came a deep silence, and I knew he wept.
He did not touch the shroud, or raise the fold
That hid my face, or take my hand in his,
Or ruffle the smooth pillows for my head:
He did not love me living; but once dead
He pitied me; and very sweet it is
To know he still is warm though I am cold.","The curtains were half drawn, the floor was swept and strewn with rushes, rosemary and may. He did not touch the shroud, or raise the fold that hid my face, or take my hand in his, or ruffle the smooth pillows for my head: but once dead he pitied me.","'After Death' is from the perspective of somebody who appears to be dead. It sets the scene of a domestic environment, where perhaps the narrator is on her deathbed. Then a foreign figure enters who 'leaned above' the narrator. What follows is a progression of mourning in which the male figure expresses sympathy, 'poor child', then cries. The speaker expresses discontent in how this figure did not touch her or do other comforting acts to ease her state. 'After Death' ends with a selfless statement; where the narrator says that despite the male's lack of love, she is still glad that he lives. This poem acknowledges the continuation of ordinary life after a person's death, and it distances itself from the religious connotations associated with the 'afterlife'."
114,"When for the thorns with which I long, too long,
With many a piercing wound,
My Saviour’s head have crowned,
I seek with garlands to redress that wrong:
Through every garden, every mead,
I gather flowers (my fruits are only flowers),
Dismantling all the fragrant towers
That once adorned my shepherdess’s head.
And now when I have summed up all my store,
Thinking (so I myself deceive)
So rich a chaplet thence to weave
As never yet the King of Glory wore:
Alas, I find the serpent old
That, twining in his speckled breast,
About the flowers disguised does fold,
With wreaths of fame and interest.
Ah, foolish man, that wouldst debase with them,
And mortal glory, Heaven’s diadem!
But Thou who only couldst the serpent tame,
Either his slippery knots at once untie;
And disentangle all his winding snare;
Or shatter too with him my curious frame,
And let these wither, so that he may die,
Though set with skill and chosen out with care:
That they, while Thou on both their spoils dost tread,
May crown thy feet, that could not crown thy head.","When for the thorns with which I long, too long,                My Saviour’s head have crowned,                I seek with garlands to redress that wrong.                Through every garden, every mead, I gather flowers (my fruits are only flowers),                Dismantling all the fragrant towers that once adorned my shepherdess's head.                So rich a chaplet thence to weave (so I myself deceive)                As never yet the King of Glory wore:                Alas, I find the serpent old and old, twining in his speckled breast.                About the flowers disguised does fold, with wreaths of fame and interest.                Ah","The Coronet' by Andrew Marvell refers back to the Crucifixion story and he wants to make amends for the wrongs done to Jesus Christ. 'The Coronet' by Andrew Marvell presents the poet's attempt to honor Christ with his poetic “coronet”. To weave these garlands of honor, the poet would even remove the flowers which his beloved women have been wearing in their tall head-dresses. What the poet means is that he would collect the best available words and phrases to write a suitable poem in praise of Christ. However, the poet is now overcome by doubt. He finds the old serpent lurking amongst the flowers of the garlands which he has woven. In other words, he finds that the poem that is trying to write has been prompted by a desire to seek fame and in the hope of worldly advancement. Fame and self-interest are the temptations offered to him by Satan. The poet now scolds himself for allowing selfish motives to mar his tribute to Christ. Finally, he appeals to Christ directly to trample upon both the serpent and the garlands which the poet has so skillfully woven. His garlands could not crown Christ's head; but, when Christ tramples upon them, they will crown his feet. "

Salvation was bought but sin sold in realTime. The plot will unfold in real Time.","A ghazal is a poetic form that consists of rhyming couplets and a refrain with each line sharing the same meter. The refrain for this In Real Time ghazal poem is the phrase “In real time,” and it is repeated at the end of its every couplet. Ali takes that structure and applies it to a poem that reveals, through short eleven-syllable lines, the hellish nature of life in India, Ali’s home country. Pain, suffering, and injustice have all been intertwined very skillfully and carefully to create powerful meaning within the complex structure of a ghazal, which relates directly to the complicated social structure that is central to the underlying meaning of the poem. First developed in the 6th century in pre-Islamic-Arabic verse, this style of poetry has very personal ties with Ali as it pays homage to his Hindu and Muslim heritage. Concurrently many of his themes that Ali uses correlate with that heritage, as well. “Exile, nostalgia for lost or ruined landscapes, and political conflict” inform Ali’s all poetic works and expose his heritage. In this ghazal poem, all of these themes are evident."
116,"I imagine this midnight moment’s forest:
Something else is alive
Beside the clock’s loneliness
And this blank page where my fingers move.
Through the window I see no star:
Something more near
Though deeper within darkness
Is entering the loneliness:
Cold, delicately as the dark snow
A fox’s nose touches twig, leaf;
Two eyes serve a movement, that now
And again now, and now, and now
Sets neat prints into the snow
Between trees, and warily a lame
Shadow lags by stump and in hollow
Of a body that is bold to come
Across clearings, an eye,
A widening deepening greenness,
Brilliantly, concentratedly,
Coming about its own business
Till, with a sudden sharp hot stink of fox
It enters the dark hole of the head.
The window is starless still; the clock ticks,
The page is printed.","I imagine this midnight moment’s forest: cold, delicately as the dark snow; two eyes serve a movement, that now and then sets neat prints into the snow.

While Movement poetry was a closed system, a down-to-earth, humanistic approach to poetry, Hughes wrote with mystical language and the idea of something more. As Hughes himself said, “One of the things those poets had in common I think was the post-war mood of having ha enough … enough rhetoric, enough overweening push of any kind, enough of the dark gods, enough of the id, enough of the Angelic powers and the heroic efforts to make new worlds. They'd seen it all turn into death-camps and atomic bombs. All they wanted was to get back in civvies and get home to the wife and kids and for the rest of their lives, not a thing was going to interfere with a nice cigarette and a nice view of the park …. Now I came a bit later. I hadn't had enough. I was all for opening negotiations with whatever happened to be out there.” 'The Thought-Fox', which you can read in full here, takes this approach to poetry. It is a poem about the writing of a poem, utilizing the symbol of the fox to stand for the idea of the muse: fleeting and quick, it haunts the poet-writer, disturbing his quiet night."
117,"When it was bitter in New York City,
I would go out with my mother
past the icy buildings, stay
against her, just behind her
so she would stop the wind and snow,
and bury my face in her coat,
just there under her arm.
All winter, like her walk-in closet,
Its yellow light, I would walk into her,
Shake out my raw thoughts.

The speaker recollects her childhood memory of walking with her mother in the city. This poem shares a beautiful memory of the poet's childhood. She shares one of her memories concerning her mother. While sharing the story, she also looks back to another memory with her grandmother. Whatsoever the main idea of the poem revolves around her mother's coat which gave warmth to her in the chilling night of New York City. Often, when they went for a walk on winter nights, her mother embraced her and covered her with her coat. This scene reminds her of her mother, probably not with her when she was writing this poem."

He bought a crooked cat which caught a crooked mouse. And they all lived together in a little crooked house.

The next lines depict a “crooked cat” and mouse as well as a “little crooked house” in which they all end up."

Thus, he came to the conclusion that nature – to Wordsworth akin to the divine – was lost when men grew older. It is notable that this is the first sonnet that Wordsworth ever wrote.

120,"Through decades that ran like rivers
endless rivers of endless woes
through pick and shovel sjambok and jail
O such a long long journey

When the motor-car came
the sledge and the ox-cart began to die
but for a while the bicycle made in Britain
was the dream of every village boy

With the arrival of the bus
the city was brought into the village
and we began to yearn for the place behind the horizons

Such a long travail it was
a long journey from bush to concrete

And now I am haunted by the cave dwelling
hidden behind eighteen ninety

but my road runs and turns into dusty gravel
into over-beaten foot tracks that lead
to a plastic hut and soon to a mud-grass dwelling

and wicked bones rattling around me

The author is haunted by the cave dwelling hidden behind eighteen ninety-nine ninety-year-olds. The story is told through the eyes of a young boy as he struggles to survive in the city.,"'A Long Journey' by Musaemura Zimunya explores how an African village transformed because of British colonialism. In the first part of this poem, the speaker begins by describing the long journey that his town has been on. Their long history of tradition was interrupted by British colonialism. The speaker represents this through the image of the motor car, bicycle, and boss. The city was “brought into the village,” and people began looking to the future and to other places. The speaker bounces between feelings of acceptance about the New World in which their living and feelings of regret regarding what's been lost in the past. They do not ignore the benefits that have come to their village but are well aware of the dark hand of the past, reminding everyone of what's been lost."
121,"Not my best side, I'm afraid.
The artist didn't give me a chance to
Pose properly, and as you can see,
Poor chap, he had this obsession with
Triangles, so he left off two of my
Feet. I didn't comment at the time
(What, after all, are two feet
To a monster?) but afterwards
I was sorry for the bad publicity.
Why, I said to myself, should my conqueror
Be so ostentatiously beardless, and ride
A horse with a deformed neck and square hoofs?
Why should my victim be so
Unattractive as to be inedible,
And why should she have me literally
On a string? I don't mind dying
Ritually, since I always rise again,
But I should have liked a little more blood
To show they were taking me seriously.

It's hard for a girl to be sure if
She wants to be rescued. I mean, I quite
Took to the dragon. It's nice to be
Liked, if you know what I mean. He was
So nicely physical, with his claws
And lovely green skin, and that sexy tail,
And the way he looked at me,
He made me feel he was all ready to
Eat me. And any girl enjoys that.
So when this boy turned up, wearing machinery,
On a really dangerous horse, to be honest
I didn't much fancy him. I mean,
What was he like underneath the hardware?
He might have acne, blackheads or even
Bad breath for all I could tell, but the dragon--
Well, you could see all his equipment
At a glance. Still, what could I do?
The dragon got himself beaten by the boy,
And a girl's got to think of her future.


I have diplomas in Dragon
Management and Virgin Reclamation.
My horse is the latest model, with
Automatic transmission and built-in
Obsolescence. My spear is custom-built,
And my prototype armour
Still on the secret list. You can't
Do better than me at the moment.
I'm qualified and equipped to the
Eyebrow. So why be difficult?
Don't you want to be killed and/or rescued
In the most contemporary way? Don't
You want to carry out the roles
That sociology and myth have designed for you?
Don't you realize that, by being choosy,
You are endangering job prospects
In the spear- and horse-building industries?

You want? You're in my way.","Not my best side, I'm afraid.

Fanthorpe is a humorous transformation of the dynamic between the characters in Paolo Uccello's Saint George and the Dragon. The poem starts from the perspective of the dragon. He knows he has to be slain, as that's in the story, but he expresses his disappointment that this particular knight, with his strange horse, is going to be the one to do it. He's also annoyed that he wasn't painted better or more bloodied, as if dying dramatically. He goes on to speak ill of the woman he's supposedly wanting to eat, calling her too ugly to be edible. Next, the poet moves on to give the reader the woman's perspective. Rather than feeling fear, she too is disappointed by the knight who's come to save her. She's actually enjoyed spending time with the dragon. She sexualizes him, speaking kindly and lustfully about his colorful scales. Finally, the readers get to hear from the knight. Again, the poet puts forward a perceptive that is different than what is expected. Rather than valiant and brave, the knight comes across as self-absorbed and whiny. He becomes easily frustrated with the dragon's lack of cooperation."
122,"This is the night mail crossing the Border,
Bringing the cheque and the postal order,

Letters for the rich, letters for the poor,
The shop at the corner, the girl next door.

Pulling up Beattock, a steady climb:
The gradient's against her, but she's on time.

Past cotton-grass and moorland boulder
Shovelling white steam over her shoulder,

Snorting noisily as she passes
Silent miles of wind-bent grasses.

Birds turn their heads as she approaches,
Stare from bushes at her blank-faced coaches.

Sheep-dogs cannot turn her course;
They slumber on with paws across.

In the farm she passes no one wakes,
But a jug in a bedroom gently shakes.


Dawn freshens, Her climb is done.
Down towards Glasgow she descends,
Towards the steam tugs yelping down a glade of cranes
Towards the fields of apparatus, the furnaces
Set on the dark plain like gigantic chessmen.
All Scotland waits for her:
In dark glens, beside pale-green lochs
Men long for news.


Letters of thanks, letters from banks,
Letters of joy from girl and boy,
Receipted bills and invitations
To inspect new stock or to visit relations,
And applications for situations,
And timid lovers' declarations,
And gossip, gossip from all the nations,
News circumstantial, news financial,
Letters with holiday snaps to enlarge in,
Letters with faces scrawled on the margin,
Letters from uncles, cousins, and aunts,
Letters to Scotland from the South of France,
Letters of condolence to Highlands and Lowlands
Written on paper of every hue,
The pink, the violet, the white and the blue,
The chatty, the catty, the boring, the adoring,
The cold and official and the heart's outpouring,
Clever, stupid, short and long,
The typed and the printed and the spelt all wrong.

Thousands are still asleep,
Dreaming of terrifying monsters
Or of friendly tea beside the band in Cranston's or Crawford's:

Asleep in working Glasgow, asleep in well-set Edinburgh,
Asleep in granite Aberdeen,
They continue their dreams,
But shall wake soon and hope for letters,
And none will hear the postman's knock

For who can bear to feel himself forgotten?","This is the night mail crossing the Border, the postman brings the cheque and the postal order.

Auden is a powerful depiction and analyzes the impact of a night train carrying the mail through the Scottish countryside. The poem conforms to a consistent rhyme scheme and metrical pattern that follows the path of a train. It carries letters from every part of the world on every topic up a hill and through the grasses. The smoke flies over the train and into the distance as it powers forward towards the city. Once there, in amongst all the sleeping people, it delivers the much longed-for notes from friends, associates, business partners, and family members. Each recipient is gladdened by the feeling of remembrance, of not being forgotten. "

A penny for the Old Guy
We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men
Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!
Our dried voices, when
We whisper together
Are quiet and meaningless
As wind in dry grass
Or rats' feet over broken glass
In our dry cellar
Shape without form, shade without colour,
Paralysed force, gesture without motion;
Those who have crossed
With direct eyes, to death's other Kingdom
Remember us-if at all-not as lost
Violent souls, but only
As the hollow men
The stuffed men.
Eyes I dare not meet in dreams
In death's dream kingdom
These do not appear:
There, the eyes are
Sunlight on a broken column
There, is a tree swinging
And voices are
In the wind's singing
More distant and more solemn
Than a fading star.
Let me be no nearer
In death's dream kingdom
Let me also wear
Such deliberate disguises
Rat's coat, crowskin, crossed staves
In a field
Behaving as the wind behaves
No nearer-
Not that final meeting
In the twilight kingdom
This is the dead land
This is cactus land
Here the stone images
Are raised, here they receive
The supplication of a dead man's hand
Under the twinkle of a fading star.
Is it like this
In death's other kingdom
Waking alone
At the hour when we are
Trembling with tenderness
Lips that would kiss
Form prayers to broken stone.
The eyes are not here
There are no eyes here
In this valley of dying stars
In this hollow valley
This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms
In this last of meeting places
We grope together
And avoid speech
Gathered on this beach of the tumid river
Sightless, unless
The eyes reappear
As the perpetual star
Multifoliate rose
Of death's twilight kingdom
The hope only
Of empty men.
Here we go round the prickly pear
Prickly pear prickly pear
Here we go round the prickly pear

Not with a bang but a whimper.","Mistah Kurtz-he dead. A penny for the Old Guy. We are the hollow men                We are the stuffed men                Leaning together.Headpiece filled with straw. Alas! Our dried voices, when. we whisper togetherAre quiet and meaningless. As wind in dry grass                Or rats' feet over broken glass                In our dry cellar. Shape without form, shade without colour,Paralysed force, gesture without motion.","The Hollow Men' by T.S. Eliot describes a group of “Hollow Men” who live in a barren world as they await a change in their circumstances. The poem begins with the speaker, who is really a group, describing how their lives as “The Hollow Men.” They are, or they are like a group of scarecrows. The men are exiting somewhere between life and death, in a world, they have no agency in. It becomes clear as the poem progresses that they are unable to enter into true death. There is no money for them to cross the river. Instead, they have to wait for something to change. At the end of the poem, the men are described as dancing around a cactus and singing. Even in this context, they are unable to finish the song or their prayers to God. The poem ends with the speaker stating that the world is going to end anticlimactically. There will be no big explosion, instead, it will go out with a whisper."
124,"Sitting at her table, she serves
the sopa de arroz to me
instinctively, and I watch her,
the absolute mamá, and eat words
I might have had to say more
out of embarrassment. To speak,
now-foreign words I used to speak,
too, dribble down her mouth as she serves
me albóndigas. No more
than a third are easy to me.
By the stove she does something with words
and looks at me only with her
back. I am full. I tell her
I taste the mint, and watch her speak

make her smile. Nani never serves
herself, she only watches me
with her skin, her hair. I ask for more.

I watch the mamá warming more
tortillas for me. I watch her
fingers in the flame for me.
Near her mouth, I see a wrinkle speak
of a man whose body serves
the ants like she serves me, then more words
from more wrinkles about children, words
about this and that, flowing more
easily from these other mouths. Each serves
as a tremendous string around her,
holding her together. They speak
Nani was this and that to me
and I wonder just how much of me
will die with her, what were the words
I could have been, was. Her insides speak
through a hundred wrinkles, now, more
than she can bear, steel around her,
shouting, then, What is this thing she serves?

She asks me if I want more.
I own no words to stop her.
Even before I speak, she serves.","Nani serves me sopa de arroz and I eat words I might have had to say more out of embarrassment. Nani never serves herself, she only watches me with her skin, her hair. Her insides speak through a hundred wrinkles, now, more than she can bear.","'Nani' by Alberto Ríos is a thoughtful poem in which the speaker addresses his heritage and his connection to his Nani. The poem starts with the speaker describing being served a specific dish. As the lines progress, it becomes clear that he cares deeply for his Nani, as she does for him. But, there is some barrier to their ability to communicate clearly with one another. The speaker is often lost for words, and she's using those that he no longer understands. He spends the second stanza describing his Nani and the life she led. There is evidence of it in all of her wrinkles. They tell stories about her connections to other people and other family members. The poem concludes with her serving the speaker more food before he can find the words to tell her whether he wants more or not."
125,"Out upon it, I have lov'd
Three whole days together;
And am like to love three more,
If it prove fair weather.

Time shall molt away his wings
Ere he shall discover
In such whole wide world again
Such a constant lover.

But the spite on't is, no praise
Is due at all to me:

In the first stanza, the speaker notes that he's been in love for three days. This is something he's not shy about. Nor does he seem self-conscious about the fact that people do not fall in love in such a short period of time. He addresses it clearly and even notes that he knows it could not last. But, his love is so constant (more so than anyone else in the world) that he thinks it will. At the end of the poem, readers are confronted with new opinions from the speaker that may change their minds about him."
126,"Strange then, that this should be our last time together.
Standing in line at the locksmith's
waiting for a set of your keys to be cut
so I can visit your flat when you're out
and take back all that's mine again.

The hot day outside presses to the shop window glass,
lights the uncut sets along the wall
like lucky charms along a bracelet.
And I realise that's how I felt when we first met -
an uncut key, a smooth blade, edentate,


waiting for your impression, the milling and grooves
of moments in time, until our keyways would fit,
as they finally did in that chapel, our breaths
rising and falling in unison as we listened to the Messiah,
touching at elbow, shoulder and hip

like a pair of Siamese twins sharing one lung.
From then on I was sure we were keyed alike.
That our combinations matched,
our tumblers aligned precisely to give and roll perfectly
into the other's empty spaces.

And at night, when you slept facing away from me
and I held the bow of your hip,
again it was coming home, my stomach, the small of your back,
my knees in the hollows of yours, a master key fit.
So when did the bolt slip? The blade break in the mouth?

Useless now, I understand, to try and unpick the months
back to that second when, for the first time,
one us made a turn that failed to dock,
went nowhere, stuck half-way, leaving us
waiting the expected click, which never came.

So strange then, that we should do this now,
this cutting of keys, just when we're changing all the locks.","Strange then, that this should be our last time together. I was sure we were keyed alike. Our combinations matched,our tumblers aligned precisely to give and roll perfectly into the other's empty spaces.

The poem takes places after the relationship has ended, and has a somber tone throughout. While waiting in line, Sheers thinks back over his relationship, using the extended metaphor of a key being cut to represent the impact of moments of his relationship upon him. The final failure to connect, the key which doesn’t turn in the lock, is a symbol of the relationship breaking down. The poem is typical to Sheers, intertwining themes of relationships, and memory seamlessly."
127,"I was young when you came to me.
Each thing rings its turn,
you sang in my ear, a slip of a thing
dressed like a convent girl--
white socks, shoes,
dark blue pinafore, white blouse.

A pencil box in hand: girl, book, tree--
those were the words you gave me.
Girl was penne, hair drawn back,
gleaming on the scalp,
the self in a mirror in a rosewood room
the sky at monsoon time, pearl slits

In cloud cover, a jagged music pours:
gash of sense, raw covenant
clasped still in a gold bound book,
pusthakam pages parted,
ink rubbed with mist,
a bird might have dreamt its shadow there

spreading fire in a tree maram.
You murmured the word, sliding it on your tongue,
trying to get how a girl could turn
into a molten thing and not burn.
Centuries later worn out from travel
I rest under a tree.

You come to me
a bird shedding gold feathers,
each one a quill scraping my tympanum.
You set a book to my ribs.
Night after night I unclasp it
at the mirror's edge

alphabets flicker and soar.
Write in the light
of all the languages
you know the earth contains,
you murmur in my ear.
This is pure transport.","I was young when you came to me. You murmured the word, sliding it on your tongue, trying to get how a girl could turn into a molten thing and not burn.

The poem begins with the speaker describing how, during her youth, she met a young girl who gave her a notebook and provided for her a well of inspiration. As the poem progresses, the poet uses an extended metaphor, coming creativity and her muse to a bird. She stands in front of the mirror (an allusion to self-analysis) and writes in multiple languages, always listening to the girl whispering in her ear."
128,"You can invest everything in someone. This one feeling chopping you up. Anyone can go into the night. I just want to be gone. I want to be unknown. There’s a storm coming.

The poem takes words used by Burial in an interview, then putting them into a longer context. The poem reads like a story, Berry commenting on her own mental state. Berry creates a sense of melancholy, discussing being apart from someone. The physical sensation of missing someone is the key here, Berry exploring loss. The poem then progresses to discussing situations in which she feels unsafe. Following this, images of nature comfort the poet. The final few lines of the poem point towards memory. Being reminded of someone brings them to the forefront of your mind. Yet, Berry suggests that if you try and 'talk about it', they disappear all over again. The interview with Burial can be read here."
129,"Oh, good gigantic smile o’ the brown old earth,
This autumn morning! How he sets his bones
To bask i’ the sun, and thrusts out knees and feet
For the ripple to run over in its mirth;
Listening the while, where on the heap of stones
The white breast of the sea-lark twitters sweet.

That is the doctrine, simple, ancient, true;
Such is life’s trial, as old earth smiles and knows.

The poem begins in a romantic fashion depicting a cherishing seaside landscape with rocks, rippling waves, and sea-larks' sweet twitters. With the unfolding of the primary image, Browning's speaker hints at the simple doctrine of human life, which is to accept everything as they come like the firm rocks by the sea. Then digressing from the central image, the speaker talks about her past love. She is of the view that one should try to make their surroundings better by their pain and longings. The suffering in this world is definitely going to help one to get to heaven."
130,"I am an ancient reluctant conscript.

On the soup wagons of Xerxes I was a cleaner of pans.
On the march of Miltiades' phalanx I had a haft and head;
I had a bristling gleaming spear-handle.

Red-headed Cæsar picked me for a teamster.
He said, ""Go to work, you Tuscan bastard,
Rome calls for a man who can drive horses.""

The units of conquest led by Charles the Twelfth,
The whirling whimsical Napoleonic columns:
They saw me one of the horseshoers.

I trimmed the feet of a white horse Bonaparte swept the night stars with.

In the first part of the poem, Sandburg begins with his speaker describing himself as a reluctant conscript. He's been brought into one ancient war after another and placed at the disposal of leaders like Xerxes I and Miltiades. He survives each and travels through history and time to the troops (columns) of Napoleon and then Abraham Lincoln. It's not until the final period in time that the man gets injured."
131,"Expect nothing. Live frugally
On surprise.
Become a stranger
To need of pity
Or, if compassion be freely
Given out
Take only enough.
Stop short of urge to plead
Then purge away the need.
Wish for nothing larger
Than your own small heart
Or greater than a star;
Tame wild disappointment
With caress unmoved and cold.
Make of it a parka
For your soul.

So tiny human midget
Exists at all
So scared unwise.

On surprise.","Expect nothing. Live frugally on surprise. Become a stranger. If compassion be freely given out, take only enough. Wish for nothing larger than your own small heart or greater than a star. Make of it a parka for your soul. If you are scared unwise, expect nothing.","'Expect Nothing' by Alice Walker is a beautiful poem about living life without any expectations of it. 'Expect Nothing' by Alice Walker teaches how to stay happy without expecting anything from life. The expectation is the key to all sufferings. It keeps human beings in a chain of lifelong enslavement. The soul becomes weaker day by day and one day it ceases to exist. That's why Alice Walker says, “Wish for nothing larger/ Than your own small heart”. She tries to save readers from the trap. Discovering the reason why human beings live their lives in utter fear of losing something, will help us to “Live frugally/ on surprise.” On this note, the poet ends the poem."
132,"My uncle from Wangu asked me:
How many bushels of paddy
Have you stored for this season?
I asked my friend Kesho again:
How many kgs of poems have you written for this month?
Write and then tear up, write and then tear up;
A cashier counts old one rupee notes
A rotten, mouldy bundle of notes
One thousand ...
Seven hundred ...
Only eleven ...
Spending one hour two minutes and fifteen seconds.
Then after the final count, washing his hands clean with dettol
He eats up the notes, one by one.
True, the poet says:
Leaves do not move without a fleeting wind.
True, I also say:
Even if the wind blows or not, even if it rains or not,
Leaves never move
If there are no leaves
On the bare tree.
One knows man’s thoughts from his speech
As for the mind’s words of a tight-lipped man
One can read them from his eyes;
That is why to conceal my mind
I put on dark glasses;
Again, so that even the glasses cannot read
I keep my two eyes shut.
(Men who close their eyes can be seen inside a lockup
Or inside a sacred temple).
I’ve never seen fish flying in the sky
But I often saw ducks floating on water.
You say: you are wrong
I say: I am wrong
The Vedas say: ‘In Brahma
Lies zero.’
You also say and I too declare: What they call ‘you’
Is never me.
Which is more fragrant
The report of guns or the scent of flowers?
The sound of guns lies on the nose,
The odour of flowers on the tips of flowers.
Blind men see colours on voices.
A love letter
A horoscope of my grandfather
A radio which belongs to our mother
A pair of tweezers of my son
Ten bottles of rum flying in air
One brassiere which belongs to my grandmother
A pair of lingams
A bird carrying a bunch of keys in its beak
One whistle
Two butterflies
A cake of soap
A Shakespearean sonnet
A pair of clogs
Tied up by women’s hair. (What’s left?
Add some of your own).
An egg
Sinks slowly
Slowly, very slowly...
Piercing my sleeping teenage daughter’s
Hairless pate.
Then her two ears move lazily.
One day, wanting to own a peepal tree
I climbed atop a rich man’s tall building, and,
Entering his bathroom, looked for one.
(I like peepal trees very much;
I would like to see every citizen of Imphal
Walking with a small peepal tree
Growing on his head).
Then inside that bathroom
I found my wife leaning:
Half her body, waist above turning into a peepal
Waist below her body without clothes.
I was not surprised
I was not worried
I did not cry.
Girish Karnad,
My wife metamorphosed into your Chelluvi!
How can I claim now
That I like peepal trees?","A cashier counts old one rupee notes and eats up the notes, one by one. The sound of guns lies on the nose, the odour of flowers on the tips of flowers.

'Dali, Hussain, or Odour of Dream, Colour of Wind' by Thangjam Ibopishak Singh begins as absurdly as it ends. Likewise, in the first stanza, the poetic persona refers to two different questions, one about the yield and another about the number of poems. Thereafter, the persona sees someone counting a bundle of one-rupee notes in his dream vision. Surprisingly, the cashier eats up the notes. Moreover, in the following stanza, the poet refers to a maxim said by a poet. In the next stanza, the poet asserts his individualism and non-conformist attitude towards society. The fourth stanza is undoubtedly similar to the previous sections. Here, the poet talks about the sound of the gun alongside the scent of flowers. Thereafter, introducing a bunch of images, the poem moves to the ironical reference to the sacred peepal tree. At last, there is a reference to the metamorphosis of the poet's wife."
133,"I am the dog you put to sleep,

as you like to call the needle of oblivion,

come back to tell you this simple thing:

I never liked you--not one bit.



When I licked your face,

I thought of biting off your nose.

When I watched you toweling yourself dry,

I wanted to leap and unman you with a snap.



I resented the way you moved,

your lack of animal grace,

the way you would sit in a chair to eat,

a napkin on your lap, knife in your hand.



I would have run away,

but I was too weak, a trick you taught me

while I was learning to sit and heel,

and--greatest of insults--shake hands without a hand.



I admit the sight of the leash

would excite me

but only because it meant I was about

to smell things you had never touched.



You do not want to believe this,

but I have no reason to lie.

I hated the car, the rubber toys,

disliked your friends and, worse, your relatives.



The jingling of my tags drove me mad.

You always scratched me in the wrong place.

All I ever wanted from you

was food and fresh water in my metal bowls.



While you slept, I watched you breathe

as the moon rose in the sky.

It took all of my strength

not to raise my head and howl.



Now I am free of the collar,

the yellow raincoat, monogrammed sweater,

the absurdity of your lawn,

and that is all you need to know about this place



except what you already supposed

and are glad it did not happen sooner--

that everyone here can read and write,

the dogs in poetry, the cats and the others in prose.","I am the dog you put to sleep, the one you like to call the needle of oblivion. I never liked you--not one bit.

The poet somewhat playfully pokes fun at modern pet owners, and by extension modern people in general, by using the angry spirit of a dog to point out the various indulgent absurdities that they purchase. Throughout The Revenant, and especially after the turn, Collins implies that dogs and other animals have the same spiritual capacity as human beings. It’s possible that the poet is suggesting that dogs even have souls."

The meter is uneven and most of the lines differ in length and the number of syllables they contain. Throughout the poem, there is a consistent (-A-A) rhyming pattern. The poem's tone upon first reading seems very morose. It appears to be laden with negativity. Although the middle stanza offers hope it ends on a negative note. However, when read contextually understanding that the poem is about people that choose to lead a poor existence it takes on a slightly different meaning."
135,"Lord God, the winter has been sweet and brief
In this fair land;

The peaceful strand.

They acknowledge that people around them have suffered, but God has always been there to provide the needy with resources. The poem concludes with the speaker thanking God for all he has provided."
136,"And the trees about me,
Let them be dry and leafless; let the rocks
Groan with continual surges; and behind me

Cast in the unstilted Cyclades,
Paint me the bold anfractuous rocks
Faced by the snarled and yelping seas.

Which tangle Ariadne's hair
And swell with haste the perjured sails.
Morning stirs the feet and hands

Gesture of orang-outang

Slitted below and gashed with eyes,

Find themselves involved, disgraced,
Call witness to their principles
And deprecate the lack of taste

It does the house no sort of good.

Enters padding on broad feet,
Bringing sal volatile
And a glass of brandy neat.","The story is set in the Cyclades, in the Greek island of Aeolus. It is the story of the life of Sweeney, a young man living in France in the early 20th century. The story is told from the point of view of Sweeney's wife, Doris Turner.","Sweeney Erect' by T.S. Eliot introduces one of Eliot's best-known characters, Sweeney, in a brothel alongside an epileptic woman. The poem takes the reader through a turbulent mental and emotional landscape that leads to Sweeney's room in a brothel. There, he is standing at a full-length mirror shaving while the woman he presumably slept with is writhing on the bed. He shows no interest in her suffering and goes about his business as calmly as he can. The poem concludes with other women intervening and trying to revive the woman with smelling salts. "
137,"I can taste the tin of the sky —- the real tin thing.
Winter dawn is the color of metal,
The trees stiffen into place like burnt nerves.
All night I have dreamed of destruction, annihilations —-
An assembly-line of cut throats, and you and I
Inching off in the gray Chevrolet, drinking the green
Poison of stilled lawns, the little clapboard gravestones,
Noiseless, on rubber wheels, on the way to the sea resort.

How the balconies echoed! How the sun lit up
The skulls, the unbuckled bones facing the view!
Space! Space! The bed linen was giving out entirely.
Cot legs melted in terrible attitudes, and the nurses —-
Each nurse patched her soul to a wound and disappeared.
The deathly guests had not been satisfied
With the rooms, or the smiles, or the beautiful rubber plants,
Or the sea, Hushing their peeled sense like Old Mother Morphia.","I can taste the tin of the sky —- the real tin thing.                 The trees stiffen into place like burnt nerves.                 All night I have dreamed of destruction, annihilations —-An assembly-line of cut throats, and you and I                 Inching off in the gray Chevrolet, drinking the green.                Poison of stilled lawns, the little clapboard gravestones, on rubber wheels.","Waking in Winter' by Sylvia Plath describes a natural landscape, a hotel, and those who reside there as hopeless and loveless. In the first lines of 'Waking in Winter' the sky is portrayed as hard, cold and slick and the trees are relayed to the reader as “stiff” as if “burnt nerves.” With these descriptions, Plath intended to convey a space that is devoid of feeling— it has all been burnt off. The “nerves” which are responsible for feeling within the human body, are destroyed. In the fourth line, she takes the reader into her dreams and speaks about “destruction, annihilations”. It soon becomes clear that the speaker and a companion are taking a car trip to a resort, but the places they pass are dark, poisoned, and speak of death. Eventually, they get to the resort and the speaker describes skull-like people looking at the views, and emotionless nurses tending to those in residence there. The whole poem feels colorless, loveless, and hopeless. Death is the reigning power in the world Plath has created."
138,"I read of a man who stood to speak
At the funeral of a friend
He referred to the dates on the tombstone
From the beginning...to the end

He noted that first came the date of birth
And spoke the following date with tears,
But he said what mattered most of all
Was the dash between those years

For that dash represents all the time
That they spent alive on earth.
And now only those who loved them
Know what that little line is worth

For it matters not, how much we own,
The cars...the house...the cash.
What matters is how we live and love
And how we spend our dash.

So, think about this long and hard.
Are there things you'd like to change?
For you never know how much time is left
That can still be rearranged.

If we could just slow down enough
To consider what's true and real
And always try to understand
The way other people feel.

And be less quick to anger
And show appreciation more
And love the people in our lives
Like we've never loved before.

If we treat each other with respect
And more often wear a smile,
Remembering this special dash
Might only last a little while

So, when your eulogy is being read
With your life's actions to rehash...
Would you be proud of the things they say
About how you spent YOUR dash?",I read of a man who stood to speak at the funeral of a friend. He referred to the dates on the tombstone from the beginning...to the end.

That dash represents all the time they spent alive on earth.,"'The Dash' by Linda Ellis is a well-known poem that addresses the brevity of life and the importance of living a good loved-filled one. The poem begins with the speaker describing a speech they heard about. It was given by a man at a funeral who was addressing the life of his deceased friend. He asked everyone there to consider the “dash” in between the friend's birth and death. That, he said, is what really matters. Using this little story as the basis for the poem, the speaker talks to the reader. They ask everyone to consider how they've been living their own dash and if after they've died they would be proud of what they've done."
139,"She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that’s best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.

One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o’er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.

And on that cheek, and o’er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!","She walks in beauty, like the night, with cloudless climes and starry skies. Her thoughts serenely sweet express, how pure, how dear their dwelling-place. Her smile that win, the tints that glow, tell of days in goodness spent. A heart whose love is innocent!","Scholars believe that 'She Walks in Beauty' by Lord Byron was written when the poet met his cousin, Mrs. Anne Beatrix Wilmont. The speaker spends the lines celebrating the beauty of one woman. He compares her beauty to night rather than day. The latter is suggested to be “gaudy,” and the “lady” certainly isn't. The speaker describes different aspects of the woman, like her hair and skin. She is the image of peaceful beauty. The woman is unaware of the impact that she's had on the speaker, who is also the poet, by the end of 'She Walks in Beauty.' The speaker is interested in the woman's inner beauty as well as her outer beauty or physical beauty."
140,"Father, father, where are you going
O do not walk so fast.
Speak father, speak to your little boy
Or else I shall be lost,

The night was dark no father was there
The child was wet with dew.
The mire was deep, & the child did weep
And away the vapour flew.","Father, father, where are you going? The night was dark no father was there. The child was wet with dew. The mire was deep, & the child did weep. And away the vapour flew. And the child said: ""I am lost, I am lost""","‘The Little Boy Lost’ by William Blake is the story of a young child who while out searching for his father, gets lost in the woods. In this piece the “father” of the boy is getting farther and farther away from him, the child cannot hear or see him. He is without guidance in the dark but after a time of suffering the “vapours” fly away and he is, presumably, able to find his way back. Just as one might for a time lose their faith in God, feel lost in the woods in the search to return to him, and then finally be able to see clearly, so too does the boy overcome his situation."
141,"when my father had been dead a week
I woke
with his voice in my ear

This short poem creates a grave mood by using symbols and imagery. It consists of a set of images including the “pale closed door,” “white apples,” “taste of stone,” “coat,” and “galoshes”. Each image refers to a particular idea that is integral to the theme. This poem presents a speaker, probably the poet himself, who has lost his father a week ago. One day, he wakes up by hearing the echo of his father's voice. It makes him restless and sad. He looks around him. In each item he stares at contains the hue of death. In the end, he wishes if his father called him again, he would be there at his side."
142,"Ysinno cut the bamboo near Haniketta ,
And from those wattles made his hut
And had nothing to cover it with, nothing
Like a hundred and sixty
Bales of straw.

So he made his way to the Walauva at Iddamalgoda
And to the Menike said how poor he was.
And how from his twenties he had made those lines of song
Swearing before her all his fealties.
So she said, Wait for the Yala
Harvest and take the straw.

Ysinno said, O the rains are coming near,
My woman fretting, her kid will get all wet
Then the kind Menike said, O then
You take what straw you need from the behind shed
And Ysinno being a folk poet and his lines not being all dead ,
The benison of the Menike of Iddamalgoda
Lives even today.","Ysinno cut the bamboo near Haniketta, and from those wattles made his hut. He had nothing to cover it with, nothing like a hundred and sixtyBales of straw. So he made his way to the Walauva at Iddamalgoda and to the Menike said how poor he was.","Folk poet, Ysinno' by Lakdasa Wikramasingha describes the plight of the folk poet “Ysinno” and his efforts to roof his newly built bamboo hut. The poem begins with the speaker stating that Ysinno is cutting bamboo to build his family a new home. He is doing all of the work on his own, without help. By the time he has all the “wattles” he needs to construct the house he realizes he doesn't have the straw he needs for the roof. Ysinno travels to the nearby “Walauwa” or manor house and asks the “Menike,” or lady of the house for help. He is told to come back at the end of the next harvest season when he can retrieve the straw he needs. Ysinno is unable to wait that long and tells her so. She is moved by his plight and allows him to take what he needs from behind the shed. It is due to this act of kindness that he and his family survive the season. Her blessing lived on through them."
143,"Let the boy try along this bayonet-blade
How cold steel is, and keen with hunger of blood;
Blue with all malice, like a madman's flash;
And thinly drawn with famishing for flesh.

Lend him to stroke these blind, blunt bullet-leads, 
Which long to nuzzle in the hearts of lads, 
Or give him cartridges of fine zinc teeth 
Sharp with the sharpness of grief and death.

For his teeth seem for laughing round an apple.
There lurk no claws behind his fingers supple;
And God will grow no talons at his heels,
Nor antlers through the thickness of his curls.","Let the boy try along this bayonet-blade. How cold steel is, and keen with hunger of blood. Blue with all malice, like a madman's flash. And thinly drawn with famishing for flesh. Lend him to stroke these blind, blunt bullet-leads. Long to nuzzle in the hearts of lads.","'Arms and the Boy' by Wilfred Owen is a disturbing poem that depicts through poignant images of armaments the true nature of war. In the first two stanzas of the poem, the speaker describes the weaponry which a young man is going to have to take up to fight against his prescribed enemies. The bayonet and bullets are personified. They are described as a longing for flesh and as having sharp teeth that are poised to inflict horror on anyone. The final stanza contrasts the previous in that it talks about the boy's nature. He was not built for this destruction. He's young and happy and there's nothing about him that's monstrous or terrible, unlike war itself."
144,"I’m best observed on stage,
Propping a spear, or making endless
Exits and entrances with my servant’s
patter, Yes, sir. O no, sir. If I get
These midget moments wrong, the monstrous fabric
Shrinks to unwanted sniggers.

But my heart’s in the unobtrusive,
The waiting-room roles: driving to hospitals,
Parking at hospitals. Holding hands under
Veteran magazines; making sense
Of consultants’ monologues; asking pointed
Questions politely; checking dosages,
Dates; getting on terms with receptionists;
Sustaining the background music of civility.
At home in the street you may see me
Walking fast in case anyone stops:
getting on, getting better my formula
For well-meant intrusiveness.

At home,
Thinking ahead: Bed? A good idea!
(Bed solves a lot); answer the phone,
Be wary what I say to it, but grateful always;
Contrive meals for hunger-striker; track down
Whimsical soft-centred happy-all-the-way-through novels;
Find the cat (mysteriously reassuring);
Cancel things; pretend all’s well,
Admit it’s not. Learn to conjugate all the genres of misery:
Tears, torpor, boredom, lassitude, yearnings
For a simpler illness, like a broken leg.
Enduring ceremonial delays. Being referred
Somewhere else. Consultant’s holiday. Saying Thank you,
For anything to everyone
Not the star part.

And who would want it? I jettison the spear,
The servant’s try, the terrible drone of Chorus:
Yet to my thinking this act was ill advised
It would have been better to die*. No it wouldn’t!
I am here to make you believe in life.","I’m best observed on stage, Propping a spear, or making endless entrances with my servant’spatter, Yes, sir.

Fanthorpe is a reflection on the role the poet has been forced to play within society due to her illness. There is a fine line between the life the poet wants and the one she has, and this is explored through the constantly changing narrative directions of the poem. Fanthorpe challenges the reader to reflect on their own life, on the role they play, and how they present themselves to society. Although the tone of the poem is overly sardonic, there are flashes of an innate desire to live and to thrive. Fanthorpe seems to be caught in a purgatory of wanting more and finding out how to live as she is."
145,"I leant upon a coppice gate
When Frost was spectre-grey,
And Winter's dregs made desolate
The weakening eye of day.
The tangled bine-stems scored the sky
Like strings of broken lyres,
And all mankind that haunted nigh
Had sought their household fires.

The Century's corpse outleant,
His crypt the cloudy canopy,
The wind his death-lament.

Was shrunken hard and dry,
And every spirit upon earth
Seemed fervourless as I.

The bleak twigs overhead
In a full-hearted evensong
Of joy illimited;
An aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,
In blast-beruffled plume,
Had chosen thus to fling his soul
Upon the growing gloom.
So little cause for carolings
Of such ecstatic sound
Was written on terrestrial things
Afar or nigh around,
That I could think there trembled through
His happy good-night air
Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew
And I was unaware.","I leant upon a coppice gate when Frost was spectre-grey, and Winter's dregs made desolate.

146,"Brushing out my daughter’s dark
silken hair before the mirror
I see the gray gleaming on my head,
the silver-haired servant behind her. Why is it
just as we begin to go
they begin to arrive, the fold in my neck

hips sharpen? As my skin shows
its dry pitting, she opens like a small
pale flower on the tip of a cactus;

The latter is starting to become a woman while the former is going grey and getting more wrinkles and folds. In the first lines of this piece, the speaker describes brushing her daughter's hair. She compares it to her own and describes herself as a servant, standing behind her daughter as she grows more beautiful. She sees the changes happening in her daughter's body and recognizes how they juxtapose with those happening in her own. Furthermore, she's getting old, and her daughter is becoming a woman. The speaker sees how her daughter is going to replace her in the world. She's going to be the woman the speaker is now and once was."

Reading the Roll of Honour. ""Poor young chap,""

It is a short, scathing poem about the inadequacy of British leadership during the First World War, and an indictment of the same system that allowed underqualified men into positions where they commanded great numbers of troops. It is well worth remembering that higher ranks were only available to men of some means and money who could afford to buy the uniform; therefore, the British army was primarily composed of the poor at the bottom, and the rich at the top, where the rich were mostly useless at leading troops."
148,"It felt like the zero in brook ice.
She was my youngest aunt, the summer before
We had stood naked
While she stiffened and giggled, letting the minnows
Nibble at her toes. I was almost four—
That evening she took me
To the springhouse where on the scoured planks
There were rows of butter in small bricks, a mold
Like ermine on the cheese,
And cut onions to rinse the air
Of the black, sickly-sweet meats of rotting pecans.

She said butter was colored with marigolds
Plucked down by the marsh
With its tall grass and miner’s-candles.
We once carried the offal’s pail beyond the barn
To where the fox could be caught in meditation.
Her bed linen smelled of camphor. We went

In late March for her burial. I heard the men talk.
I saw the minnows nibble at her toe.

The cancer ate her like horse piss eats deep snow.","It felt like the zero in brook ice. She was my youngest aunt, the summer before.

Unfortunately, he was unaware of the fact that she was suffering from cancer, and she died the following March."
149,"The women gather because it is not unusual to seek comfort in our hours of stress.
A man must be buried.
It is not unusual that the old bury the young though it is an abomination.
It is not strange that the unwise and the ungentle carry the banner of humaneness though it is a castration of the spirit.
It no longer shatters the intellect that those who make war call themselves diplomats.
We are no longer surprised that the unfaithful pray loudest every Sunday in church and sometimes in rooms facing east though it is a sin and a shame.
So how do we judge a man.
Most of us love from our need to love not because we find someone deserving.
Most of us forgive because we have trespassed not because we are magnanimous.
Most of us comfort because we need comforting, our ancient rituals demand that we give what we hope to receive.
And how do we judge a man.
We learn to greet when meeting, to cry when parting and to soften our words at times of stress.
The women gather with cloth and ointment, their busy hands bowing to laws that decree willows shall stand swaying but unbroken against even the determined wind of death.
We judge a man by his dreams, not alone his deeds.
We judge a man by his intent, not alone his shortcomings.

The poem begins with the speaker describing horrible times of tragedy, such as a death, “women gather” together for moral support. Together they are able to help one another through difficulties. The speaker continues to describe a number off different types of people who, themselves, can cause tragedy. She speaks on the hypocrites who pray the loudest in church, and those who present to be “humane” but never act on it. She is dismayed by diplomats who promote war and the fact that sometimes the old must bury the young. While all of these things are awful, they are abominations. They do not occur so often that the world cannot be changed. She then asks the reader how one is able to judge a man when anyone could have a secret life. She answers the question by stating that “We” must judge by understanding good intentions, even if the result aren't what the person wanted or was hoping for. We must come together and help one another in times of stress and learn to comfort when it is needed. Hope must be passed on. Through these changes we make to ourselves we will be able to find goodness within negative situations. It will exist like an “unburnt” picture pulled from ashes."

In the first line, the speaker describes a one-ton temple bell. This brings in religious allusions and should inspire the reader to consider the sound the bell might make if it's rung. It could ring, one might feel, at any moment. In contrast to the pending sound is the moonmoth. It sits on the bell, unmoving and unperturbed by the possibility that it might be disturbed violently in the near future. It is “folded into sleep.”"

Secondly, Burns presents a distinction between the nature of both the lands, Senegal and Virginia. Thereafter, in the last stanza, the poet highlights how the slave misses his family, friends, and happy memories. However, the speaker of the poem is not agitated. He is rather wary. The cause is nothing other than the loss of freedom."

Giants, a common symbol and character in Cornish stories, were well worth defeating. The tune, which is chanted by a giant in the story, is incredibly well-known today. It was even referenced by William Shakespeare in King Lear. He wrote these lines, spoken by Edgar: Child Roland to the dark tower came,His word was still “Fie, foh, and fum,I smell the blood of a British man.” The story originally appeared in a chapbook in 1711. The plot was later used in a text published in 1760 by John Cotton and Joshua Eddowes. It's unclear though where exactly this story originated from. Some suggest it could date back as early as the 1100s, in one form or another. There are some similarities between this tale and Norse Mythology, such as the various miniature series within the longer tale of his life. Scholars have also noted the magical objects he acquires as interesting related features. Specifically, scholars have cited a story called “The Herd-boy and the Giant” as a similar tale in addition to “Tom Thumb,” a story from Norse myth."

It is one that speaks of wealth, poverty, and friendship. The speaker in this poem experiences the loss of all that he once had. He loses his wealth, his luxuries, and his friends. Out of all that he lost, he feels the loss of his friends most acutely. The poem reveals the heart of the speaker in that he cares for other human beings more than he cares for money. The reason that he misses his money, is because he could treat his friends and be surrounded by people. His despair in losing his money and his friends can be read as both a warning and a comfort."

Each of the poem's eight-line sections begins with describing a liminal, or in-between, space in which the speaker exists. In the first, she is between night and day, the second, between the stars and moon, and finally, in the third, between today and tomorrow. Within each one of these spaces, she is confronted by a sound that reminds her of something she “longs” for. Voices are calling and sound reverberating, falling, and rising around her. These noises remind her of her birds and the sounds of minstrels playing music. 'A Hope Carol' concludes with the speaker's final acceptance of the fact that her future, and all the things she most desires, may come today, or “may be” tomorrow. She knows she can't control the world and is willing to wait to get what she wants the most."

The one that applies to this poem is considered archaic, meaning that while this word was used for this purpose in the past, it isn't used to mean this now) ferocity: a ferocious quality or state; savage fierceness geranium: This is typically used to describe a type of flower, but in this context, it refers to a vivid red color"

The poem resolves by finishing all of these sentences, and Tagore makes a plea to his Father, for his country to wake up into “that heaven of freedom.” In this poem, Tagore lays out the tenants of what could be called a utopian society."
157,"Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.
In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.
Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds and shall find me unafraid.
It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate,
I am the captain of my soul.","Out of the night that covers me,                Black as the pit from pole to pole,                I thank whatever gods may be                For my unconquerable soul.                Under the bludgeonings of chance                My head is bloody, but unbowed.                Beyond this place of wrath and tears                Looms but the Horror of the shade.                I am the captain of my soul.","In this poem, the speaker is faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges. Throughout it all, however, he perseveres and is successful in his endeavors. He faces each challenge with courage and is not afraid, and he can surmount any hardship. “In the fell clutch of circumstance” or “Under the bludgeonings of chance,” he has not bowed his head. However, he knows at some point in time; one has to enter the horrid palace of death.

But, it shall find the speaker unafraid. It does not matter to him how narrow the gate to heaven is. Neither the “punishments” inscribed on the “scroll” makes him frightened. It is his self-belief and courage that will sail him through all the difficulties."
158,"For six months just head without body, six months just body without head, has anyone
seen a land inhabited by these people?
No? I have; it’s not a folktale; I’ve not only seen but have been to that land.
For six months to talk and to eat is their job; like a millstone grinding. The following six
months Bhima gorging and Shakuni suffering; for the headless body only shitting is its
share. The head talks, eats, drinks; just talking, eating, drinking. While the body is
working, laboring, shitting; work, labor, shit. To sweat, to be bone-weary. In the land of
the half- body.
Do women live in that land? What does the species of women look like?
There are women; there are children. The same goes for women too, half-and-half body.
They have long hair like the women of our land. They are big, tall, buxom, broad and
well- proportioned. As for clothes, they hang them below the waist. The law of the land
does not permit a body hidden by clothes. When the body dwells for six months it is
springtime for them. (Since the bodies are headless when the men and the women meet,
they are not fastidious). The head-only gives birth within six months. Besides talking and
eating the mouths of the women also deliver babies. The women have more attributes
than the men do. That is why the women have no teeth. God created them with ingenuity.
When the head walks, its two broad, fanlike ears, spread wide and it flies like a bird,
beating its wings. When they speak, we can comprehend their language; they speak the
language of men. But when the headless body speaks, a voice that no stranger can
recognize emits from an orifice of the body. This voice is also accompanied by an odor.
A land such as this one is in the news; a land much talked about. The moon shines at
night; the sun shines in the afternoon. There is no predicament of poverty; dearth of food
and clothes is unknown. Some men even surpass Kuber. And the earnings of the body’s
sweat of six months, the six month-old head eats up with a vengeance.
There are political rights; a government is set up in the land. Democracy functions with
total success. An election is held every five years. But for the people in this land there
are no names. So for the nameless citizens the nameless representatives govern the land
of the half-humans. Because whether to give human names to the head or to the body —
no one can decide. A land such as this is very much in the news, a land much talked
about.","For six months to talk and to eat is their job; like a millstone grinding. The head talks, eats, drinks; just talking, eating, drinking. While the body is working, laboring, shitting. To sweat, to be bone-weary. In the land of the half- body.","'The Land of the Half-Humans' by Thangjam Ibopishak Singh talks about an imaginary land inhabited by humans living six months with heads and the rest with bodies. 'The Land of the Half-Humans' by Thangjam Ibopishak Singh talks about a place similar to any Indian state where humans live with heads for six months and the rest of the year with only their bodies. That's why those peculiar humans go on eating, drinking, and talking for the first six months. In the rest of the year, the “half-body” performs working, laboring, and shitting. The women of this land have well-proportioned bodies and unlike men, they give birth through their mouths. According to the poet, this land inhabited by nameless half-humans is always in the news. The poet isn't sure why the land is so famous as it is just like any other democratic state of India."
159,"I have been so great a lover: filled my days
So proudly with the splendour of Love's praise,
The pain, the calm, and the astonishment,
Desire illimitable, and still content,
And all dear names men use, to cheat despair,
For the perplexed and viewless streams that bear
Our hearts at random down the dark of life.
Now, ere the unthinking silence on that strife
Steals down, I would cheat drowsy Death so far,
My night shall be remembered for a star
That outshone all the suns of all men's days.
Shall I not crown them with immortal praise
Whom I have loved, who have given me, dared with me
High secrets, and in darkness knelt to see
The inenarrable godhead of delight?
Love is a flame:—we have beaconed the world's night.
A city:—and we have built it, these and I.
An emperor:—we have taught the world to die.
So, for their sakes I loved, ere I go hence,
And the high cause of Love's magnificence,
And to keep loyalties young, I'll write those names
Golden for ever, eagles, crying flames,
And set them as a banner, that men may know,
To dare the generations, burn, and blow
Out on the wind of Time, shining and streaming . . . .
These I have loved:
White plates and cups, clean-gleaming,
Ringed with blue lines; and feathery, faery dust;
Wet roofs, beneath the lamp-light; the strong crust
Of friendly bread; and many-tasting food;
Rainbows; and the blue bitter smoke of wood;
And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers;
And flowers themselves, that sway through sunny hours,
Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon;
Then, the cool kindliness of sheets, that soon
Smooth away trouble; and the rough male kiss
Of blankets; grainy wood; live hair that is
Shining and free; blue-massing clouds; the keen
Unpassioned beauty of a great machine;
The benison of hot water; furs to touch;
The good smell of old clothes; and other such—
The comfortable smell of friendly fingers,
Hair's fragrance, and the musty reek that lingers
About dead leaves and last year's ferns. . . .
Dear names,
And thousand other throng to me! Royal flames;
Sweet water's dimpling laugh from tap or spring;
Holes in the ground; and voices that do sing;
Voices in laughter, too; and body's pain,
Soon turned to peace; and the deep-panting train;
Firm sands; the little dulling edge of foam
That browns and dwindles as the wave goes home;
And washen stones, gay for an hour; the cold
Graveness of iron; moist black earthen mould;
Sleep; and high places; footprints in the dew;
And oaks; and brown horse-chestnuts, glossy-new;
And new-peeled sticks; and shining pools on grass;—
All these have been my loves. And these shall pass,
Whatever passes not, in the great hour,
Nor all my passion, all my prayers, have power
To hold them with me through the gate of Death.
They'll play deserter, turn with the traitor breath,
Break the high bond we made, and sell Love's trust
And sacramented covenant to the dust.
——Oh, never a doubt but, somewhere, I shall wake,
And give what's left of love again, and make
New friends, now strangers. . . . But the best I've known
Stays here, and changes, breaks, grows old, is blown
About the winds of the world, and fades from brains
Of living men, and dies.
Nothing remains.
O dear my loves, O faithless, once again
This one last gift I give: that after men
Shall know, and later lovers, far-removed,
Praise you, 'All these were lovely'; say, 'He loved.'","I have been so great a lover: filled my days so proudly with the splendour of Love's praise. My night shall be remembered for a star that outshone all the suns of all men's days. For their sakes I loved, ere I go hence, I'll write those names: eagles, crying flames, and set them as a banner.","The Great Lover' by Rupert Brooke contains a speaker's profession of love for his past partners and a wide range of objects and experiences. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he has been a “great…lover.” A reader will soon come to understand that this refers to intimate partners as well as experiences. First, he takes the time to describe how his love is at night brighter than any other star in the sky. Anyone who saw it would remember it and pass on their astonishment at its brilliance. The speaker goes on to state that he has loved many things and wants to write their names on a banner and wave it in the wind. This way they will always be remembered. In the next lines he lists out a great number of objects and experiences he has seen and had in his life. These range from “blue-massing clouds” and “furs to touch” to “footprints in the dew” and pools of water. Although the speaker has spent the first two-thirds of the poem bragging on the variety of things he loves, the mood changes in the last section. Here, he tries to come to terms with the fact that he is going to lose everything in his life when he dies. When he passes into the realm of death all the “loves” of his life will abandon him. They will become “faithless” and remain on earth. He is saddened by this prospect but also somewhat cheered as he knows he'll find new loves wherever he ends up. His parting gift to his past life is that his “loves” will be known by all to be splendid."
160,"I really thought that drinking here would
Start a new chain, that the soft storms
Would abate, and the horror stories, the
Noises men make to frighten themselves,
rest secure on the lip as a canyon as day
Died away, and they would still be there the next morning.
Nothing is very simple.
You must remember that certain things die out for awhile
So that they can be remembered with affection
Later on and become holy. Look at Art Deco
For instance or the ""tulip mania"" of Holland:
Both things we know about and recall
With a certain finesse as though they were responsible
For part of life. And we congratulate them.
Each day as the sun wends its way
Into your small living room and stays
You remember the accident of night as though it were a friend.
All that is forgotten now. There are no
Hard feelings, and it doesn't matter that it will soon
Come again. You know what I mean. We are wrapped in
What seems like a positive, conscious choice, like a bird
In air. It doesn't matter that the peonies are tipped in soot
Or that a man will come to station himself each night
Outside your house, and leave shortly before dawn,
That nobody answers when you pick up the phone.
You have all lived through lots of these things before
And know that life is like an ocean: somethimes the tide is out
And sometimes it's in, but it's always the same body of water
Even though it looks different, and
It makes the things on the shore look different.
They depend on each other like the snow and the snowplow.
It's only after realizing this for a long time
That you can make a chain of events like days
That more and more rapidly come to punch their own number
Out of the calendar, draining it. By that time
Space will be a jar with no lid, and you can live
Any way you like out on those vague terraces,
Verandas, walkways-- the forms of space combined with itme
We are allowed, and we live them passionately,
Fortunately, though we can never be described
And would make lousy characters in a novel.","I really thought that drinking here would start a new chain, that the soft storms would abate, and the horror stories, the noise men make to frighten themselves, would end. But nothing is very simple.

In the first lines of this poem, the speaker uses the first-person perspective to suggest that they are seeking a change in their life, looking for a way to abate the “soft storms of life and “rest secure.” As the poem progresses, the speaker describes the ways that human beings look back on the past and reframe it in a new way. They specifically cite the tulip mania in Holland and the Art Deco movement. In the following lines, the speaker continues to discuss the ways that human beings consider the ups and downs of life. Ashbery uses a very interesting simile to compare the positives and negatives of life to the high and low tides in the ocean. Even though the ocean looks different, it is still the same ocean, just as life is the same no matter if it feels positive or negative. These lights and darks, like day and night, depending on one another. The poem concludes with several more image-rich and interesting statements about the nature of life and the way that people choose to live it."
161,"When Ma Rainey
Comes to town,
Folks from anyplace
Miles aroun’,
From Cape Girardeau,
Poplar Bluff,
Flocks in to hear
Ma do her stuff;
Comes flivverin’ in,
Or ridin’ mules,
Or packed in trains,

An’ Long Boy ripples minors on de black an’ yellow keys.

Brown describes the charismatic effect Ma Rainey has on her fans and how everyone can relate to her songs. The first part of the poem describes how folks from miles away come to town just to attend a Ma Rainey show. People from Cape Girardeau to Poplar Bluff travel for miles down to New Orleans in motorcars and mules to listen to her songs. The second part describes the scene before she comes on stage. Folks from all walks of life gather there and sit patiently for her to come before them. Her songs, perhaps her emotions, can travel directly to their hearts as she speaks in their language and sings their unlucky tales. In the final section, the narrator talks about one fellow, who once listened to Ma Rainey singing “Backwater Blues.” He could say nothing much except how she just gets hold of them in some kind of way."
162,"Fear no more the heat o’ the sun,
Nor the furious winter’s rages;
Thou thy worldly task hast done,
Home art gone, and ta’en thy wages:
Golden lads and girls all must,
As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.

Fear no more the frown o’ the great;
Thou art past the tyrant’s stroke;
Care no more to clothe and eat;
To thee the reed is as the oak:
The scepter, learning, physic, must
All follow this, and come to dust.

Fear no more the lightning flash,
Nor the all-dreaded thunder stone;
Fear not slander, censure rash;
Thou hast finished joy and moan:
All lovers young, all lovers must
Consign to thee, and come to dust.

Nor no witchcraft charm thee!
Ghost unlaid forbear thee!
Nothing ill come near thee!
Quiet consummation have;
And renownèd be thy grave!","Fear no more the heat o’ the sun, nor the furious winter’s rages, says the poet. Golden lads and girls all must, as chimney-sweepers, come to dust. The scepter, learning, physic, must all follow this, and come to Dust. No exorciser harm thee! nor no witchcraft charm thee!","Fear no more the heat o' the sun' by William Shakespeare is a fairly simple song about death taken from the tragedy Cymbeline. In the lines of the poem/song, the two speakers go through all the reasons that the listeners, who can't actually hear them, should be glad their dead. They are rid of all work, jobs, and responsibilities that the real world would demand of them. They also don't have to worry about punishments from those in power or following any set of rules. There is also a repetition of the fact that everyone, no matter their beauty, power, or age will find death."
163,"When I die
Give what’s left of me away
To children
And old men that wait to die.
And if you need to cry,
Cry for your brother
Walking the street beside you.
And when you need me,
Put your arms
Around anyone
And give them
What you need to give to me.

I want to leave you something,
Something better
Than words
Or sounds.

Look for me
In the people I’ve known
Or loved,
And if you cannot give me away,
At least let me live on in your eyes
And not on your mind.

You can love me most
By letting
Hands touch hands,
By letting
Bodies touch bodies,
And by letting go
Of children
That need to be free.

People do.
So, when all that’s left of me
Is love,
Give me away.

In the earth.","When I die, give what’s left of me away to children and old men that wait to die. If you need to cry, cry for your brother. I want to leave you something, something better than words or sounds.

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins by telling the listener/s that they want their life and death to do as much good for the world as possible. This means that their body should be given away to those who need it, as well as their memory utilized in the best way. The speaker wants the listener to consider the love they shared and rather than mourn it, use it to better the world. The speaker doesn't want anyone to cry for them. Instead, people should cry for and pay attention to those who are still alive and suffering. Turn to them and use whatever energy “you” have to improve their lives. "
164,"I am a kind word uttered and repeated
By the voice of Nature;
I am a star fallen from the
Blue tent upon the green carpet.
I am the daughter of the elements
With whom Winter conceived;
To whom Spring gave birth; I was
Reared in the lap of Summer and I
Slept in the bed of Autumn.


At dawn I unite with the breeze
To announce the coming of light;
At eventide I join the birds
In bidding the light farewell.


The plains are decorated with
My beautiful colors, and the air
Is scented with my fragrance.


As I embrace Slumber the eyes of
Night watch over me, and as I
Awaken I stare at the sun, which is
The only eye of the day.


I drink dew for wine, and hearken to
The voices of the birds, and dance
To the rhythmic swaying of the grass.


I am the lover's gift; I am the wedding wreath;
I am the memory of a moment of happiness;
I am the last gift of the living to the dead;
I am a part of joy and a part of sorrow.


But I look up high to see only the light,
And never look down to see my shadow.
This is wisdom which man must learn.","I am a kind word uttered and repeated by the voice of Nature. At dawn I unite with the breeze to announce the coming of light.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that the poem is not being narrated from the perspective of a human being. If one does not consider the title, the identity of the speaker is a mystery at first. The poem will provide a great amount of context through its text which will eventually bring one to the correct conclusion. The speaker is talking through the voice of a flower. The first stanzas describe when it is flowers are most active and beneficial to the world. They spreads their fragrances through the air and help to announce the sunrise alongside the birds. The second half of the poem speaks on how flowers are used for different occasions. The speaker says that “I am…” used in a range of objects and events, alongside the living and the dead. In the final lines the flower-speaker asserts an opinion that humankind needs to look to flowers for advice on how to face the world optimistically. "
165,"A slumber did my spirit seal;
I had no human fears:

With rocks, and stones, and trees.","A slumber did my spirit seal; I had no human fears. She seemed a thing that could not feel the touch of earthly years. No motion has she now, no force; she neither hears nor sees. She neither hears or sees; she does not hear or see.","'A Slumber did my Spirit Seal' by William Wordsworth tells of a speaker's realization that his beloved is not immune to the ravages of time. The poem begins with the speaker describing how up until now his “spirit” had been sealed off. His mind and soul had been protected from the realization that his love, Lucy, was going to be subject to aging, just like everyone else. Because he never actively acknowledged this fact he lived without “human fears.” His lack of fear made him unprepared for the shock of reality when his love died. It had seemed to him, while she was still alive, and his spirit was in that trance-like state, that Lucy could not “feel / The touch of earthly years.” Time could not affect her as it does everyone else. This illusion was shattered. The second stanza of the poem speaks of this realization. His love now has “no motion” or forced to move through the world with. Additionally, time and death have taken her sight and hearing from her. Aging has done to her what it does to every other living thing and she has become a true part of the earth. Just as the “rocks, and stones, and trees” change with time, so now, the speaker sees, does Lucy."
166,"To think

Throughout the four simple stanzas of the poem, the speaker explores two different, contrasting, ways of being. One can either be alone or they can be together with another person. The speaker makes it clear throughout the following lines that when he's alone he'd rather be with the person he loves and when he's with that person he'd rather be alone."

In the poem 'Flash Crimson,' Sandburg begins with a pleading commentary on the hardships a speaker desires in life. He indirectly renounces all worldly desires and vanity. In his statements, the speaker's assurance seems to come from his conviction that his afterlife will be the best of the best. Sandburg also explains that regardless of a person's death, their legacy, deeds, kindness, and memories will remain on earth forever."
168,"Now I begin to know at last,
These nights when I sit down to rhyme,
The form and measure of that vast
God we call Poetry, he who stoops
And leaps me through his paper hoops
A little higher every time.
Tempts me to think I’ll grow a proper
Singing cricket or grass-hopper
Making prodigious jumps in air
While shaken crowds about me stare
Aghast, and I sing, growing bolder
To fly up on my master’s shoulder
Rustling the thick stands of his hair.
He is older than the seas,
Older than the plains and hills,
And older than the light that spills
From the sun’s hot wheel on these.
He wakes the gale that tears your trees,
He sings to you from window sills.
At you he roars, or he will coo,
He shouts and screams when hell is hot,
Riding on the shell and shot.
He smites you down, he succours you,
And where you seek him, he is not.
To-day I see he has two heads
Like Janus—calm, benignant, this;
That, grim and scowling: his beard spreads
From chin to chin: this god has power
Immeasurable at every hour:
He first taight lovers how to kiss,
He brings down sunshine after shower,
Thunder and hate are his also,
He is YES and he is NO.
The black beard spoke and said to me,
‘Human fraility though you be,
Yet shout and crack your whip, be harsh!
They’ll obey you in the end:
Hill and field, river and marsh
Shall obey you, hop and skip
At the terrour of your whip,
To your gales of anger bend.’
The pale beard spoke and said in turn
‘True: a prize goes to the stern,
But sing and laugh and easily run
Through the wide airs of my plain,
Bathe in my waters, drink my sun,
And draw my creatures with soft song;
They shall follow you along
Graciously with no doubt or pain.’
Then speaking from his double head
The glorious fearful monster said
‘I am YES and I am NO,
Black as pitch and white as snow,
Love me, hate me, reconcile
Hate with love, perfect with vile,
So equal justice shall be done
And life shared between moon and sun.
Nature for you shall curse or smile:
A poet you shall be, my son.’","These nights when I sit down to rhyme, I know the form and measure of that vast                God we call Poetry, he who stoops and leaps me through his paper hoops.

This poem compares poetry to God. The poet has started to know at last that what he tries to measure is something great hence immeasurable. With the help of poetry, he can leap higher than he ever thought before. The poet thinks poetry was there even before the creation as if it is God who made this whole universe. Thereafter the poet goes on to describe the nature of poetry. Comparing it to the Greek god Janus, he says it has two heads conjoined together. One face symbolizes creation and another destruction just like God. If the speaker wants to be a poet he has to establish a balance between the two qualities in poetry. "

Pleasure or businesse, so, our Soules admit
For their first mover, and are whirld by it.

This day, when my Soules forme bends toward the East.

And tune all spheares at once peirc'd with those holes?
Could I behold that endlesse height which is
Zenith to us, and our Antipodes,
Humbled below us? or that blood which is
The seat of all our Soules, if not of his,
Made durt of dust, or that flesh which was worne
By God, for his apparell, rag'd, and torne?

Upon his miserable mother cast mine eye,

Halfe of that Sacrifice, which ransom'd us?

They'are present yet unto my memory,
For that looks towards them; and thou look'st towards mee,
O Saviour, as thou hang'st upon the tree;
I turne my backe to thee, but to receive
Corrections, till thy mercies bid thee leave.
O thinke mee worth thine anger, punish mee,
Burne off my rusts, and my deformity,
Restore thine Image, so much, by thy grace,
That thou may'st know mee, and I'll turne my face.","Let mans Soule be a Spheare, and then, in this, the intelligence that moves, devotion is, and as the other Spheares, by being growneSubject to forraigne motion, lose their owne, so, our Soules admit pleasure or businesse, and are whirld by it.","Good Friday, 1613. Riding Westward' by John Donne describes a speaker's spiritual transformation and fear of confronting God on Good Friday. The poem begins with the speaker describing how the human soul exists within one sphere and the physical world another. He states that most people spend all their time in the latter. This poem is the moment when the speaker, and the poet himself, decides to turn to the spiritual side of life. In the following lines he imagines what it would be like to observe the crucifixion and admits to himself that he doesn't have the strength to do so. This is a source of shame for the speaker who wants to become close to God, still he is unable to even face the image in his head. By the end of the poem, he asks God to punish him for his weakness and therefore grant him the strength to look at death."
170,"Where the quiet-coloured end of evening smiles,
Miles and miles
On the solitary pastures where our sheep
Half-asleep
Tinkle homeward thro' the twilight, stray or stop
As they crop—
Was the site once of a city great and gay,
(So they say)
Of our country's very capital, its prince
Ages since
Held his court in, gathered councils, wielding far
Peace or war.

Now the country does not even boast a tree,
As you see,
To distinguish slopes of verdure, certain rills
From the hills
Intersect and give a name to, (else they run
Into one)
Where the domed and daring palace shot its spires
Up like fires
O'er the hundred-gated circuit of a wall
Bounding all
Made of marble, men might march on nor be prest
Twelve abreast.

And such plenty and perfection, see, of grass
Never was!
Such a carpet as, this summer-time, o'er-spreads
And embeds
Every vestige of the city, guessed alone,
Stock or stone—
Where a multitude of men breathed joy and woe
Long ago;
Lust of glory pricked their hearts up, dread of shame
Struck them tame;
And that glory and that shame alike, the gold
Bought and sold.

Now—the single little turret that remains
On the plains,
By the caper overrooted, by the gourd
Overscored,
While the patching houseleek's head of blossom winks
Through the chinks—
Marks the basement whence a tower in ancient time
Sprang sublime,
And a burning ring, all round, the chariots traced
As they raced,
And the monarch and his minions and his dames
Viewed the games.

And I know, while thus the quiet-coloured eve
Smiles to leave
To their folding, all our many-tinkling fleece
In such peace,
And the slopes and rills in undistinguished grey
Melt away—
That a girl with eager eyes and yellow hair
Waits me there
In the turret whence the charioteers caught soul
For the goal,
When the king looked, where she looks now, breathless, dumb
Till I come.

But he looked upon the city, every side,
Far and wide,
All the mountains topped with temples, all the glades'
Colonnades,
All the causeys, bridges, aqueducts,—and then
All the men!
When I do come, she will speak not, she will stand,
Either hand
On my shoulder, give her eyes the first embrace
Of my face,
Ere we rush, ere we extinguish sight and speech
Each on each.

In one year they sent a million fighters forth
South and North,
And they built their gods a brazen pillar high
As the sky
Yet reserved a thousand chariots in full force—
Gold, of course.
O heart! oh blood that freezes, blood that burns!
Earth's returns
For whole centuries of folly, noise and sin!
Shut them in,
With their triumphs and their glories and the rest!
Love is best.","Where the quiet-coloured end of evening smiles, smiles back at me. Where the domed and daring palace shot its spires up like fires. Where a girl with eager eyes and yellow hairWaits me there. In the turret whence the charioteers caught soul for the goal.","'Love Among the Ruins' by Robert Browning is a complicated Victorian poem that uses an extended metaphor to discuss love. In the first lines of 'Love Among the Ruins,' the speaker describes walking in a field and how in that field, sheep roam where a great city used to stand. It's all collapsed now, with nothing remaining but a single turret. This one turret comes to symbolize the city (which the speaker imagines in detail) throughout the poem. The city was filled with sin, greed, lust, and the desire to attain power at any cost. It's gone now, something the speaker sees as a good thing, and has been replaced by a natural, quiet landscape. He imagines a woman in the turret waiting for him and contracts their quiet love against what used to take place in the tower. The poem concludes with the speaker determining that “Love is best.”"
171,"BLAME not my Lute ! for he must sound
Of this or that as liketh me ;
For lack of wit the Lute is bound
To give such tunes as pleaseth me ;
Though my songs be somewhat strange,
And speak such words as touch thy change,
Blame not my Lute !
My Lute ! alas ! doth not offend,
Though that perforce he must agree
To sound such tunes as I intend,
To sing to them that heareth me ;
Then though my songs be somewhat plain,
And toucheth some that use to feign,

But as I strike they must obey ;
Break not them then so wrongfully,
But wreak thyself some other way ;
And though the songs which I indite
Do quit thy change with rightful spite,
Blame not my Lute !
Spite asketh spite, and changing change,
And falsèd faith must needs be known ;
The fault so great, the case so strange ;
Of right it must abroad be blown :
Then since that by thine own desart
My songs do tell how true thou art,
Blame not my Lute !
Blame but thyself that hast misdone,
And well deservèd to have blame ;
Change thou thy way, so evil begone,
And then my Lute shall sound that same ;
But if 'till then my fingers play,
By thy desert their wonted way,
Blame not my Lute !
Farewell ! unknown ; for though thou break
My strings in spite with great disdain,
Yet have I found out for thy sake,
Strings for to string my Lute again :
And if, perchance, this sely rhyme
Do make thee blush, at any time,
Blame not my Lute !","Blame not my Lute! for he must sound such tunes as I intend, and to sing to them that heareth me. Blame but thyself that hast misdone, and well deservèd to have blame ; change thou thy way, so evil begone, and then my Lutes shall sound that same.","'Blame not my Lute!' by Sir Thomas Wyatt implores the lady not to blame Wyatt's metaphorical lute which represents his verse. 'Blame not my Lute!' by Sir Thomas Wyatt talks about not blaming the poet's lute if its sound reminds the lady of her passivity for the poet. The lute, being an instrument, sounds how the user uses it. Therefore, it will be the lady's mistake if she thinks the lute itself is making such heart-wrenching sounds. However, the poet makes it clear why he uses his lute in such a manner. The lady who has broken his heart is the sole cause for giving birth to the spiteful emotions in the poet's naive heart. Moreover, the poet is giving an exact answer to the lady's cruel response. At last, the poet tells the lady to rectify her arrogance to change the tune of the poet's verse. Apart from that, if she likes the poet's songs, she can blush expressing her true feelings for the poet and his works."
172,"Content that now the bleeding bone be swept
Out of her reach, she lay upon her side.
In a blonde void sunk deep, she slept, she slept
Bland as a child, slept, breathing like a bride.
Color of noons that shimmer as they sing
Above the dunes, her sandy flanks heaved slow.
Between her paws curled inward, billowing
Waves of desert silence seemed to flow.

The crowd was gone, the bars were gone, the cage
Thinned into air, the sawdust and the fleas
Winnowed by sleep to nothing. After food,
Absence possessed her: bliss keener than rage,
If slumber’s prisoner at a bound could seize
This ghostly freedom, lapping it like blood.","In a blonde void sunk deep, she slept. Content that now the bleeding bone be swept                Out of her reach, she lay upon her side.

The cage                Thinned into air, the sawdust and the fleas                Winnowed by sleep to nothing.","“Lioness Asleep” by Babette Deutsch tells of the plight of a captive lioness whose only escape is through her dreams. The poem begins with the lioness entering an intensely realistic dream after having eaten. The meal has sent her a few moments of bliss in which she imagines herself dozing in the desert of Africa. It is there that she is able to live the life that she wants. It is not clear in the first stanza that she is actually living in an enclosure, this twist is revealed in the second stanza. It begins with the image of the bars of her cage, and the onlookers, vanishing as the lioness sinks deeper into her dreams. There, she is able to forget about the sawdust that acts as her bedding and ignore the fleas that attack her. This dream soon lifts though and she is only left with the memory of the bliss she experienced. This desire for this pleasure is so great that if she could, she would “bound” at this “freedom” and drink it “like blood.” She would, if she was able, put her whole heart into attaining freedom."
173,"The shadow of the Venetian blind on the painted wall,
Shadows of the snake-plant and cacti, the plaster animals,
Focus the tragic melancholy of the bright stare
Into nowhere, a hole like the black holes in space.
In bra and panties she sidles to the window:
Zip! Up with the blind. A fragile street scene offers itself,
With wafer-thin pedestrians who know where they are going.
The blind comes down slowly, the slats are slowly tilted up.
Why must it always end this way?
A dais with woman reading, with the ruckus of her hair
And all that is unsaid about her pulling us back to her, with her
Into the silence that night alone can’t explain.
Silence of the library, of the telephone with its pad,
But we didn’t have to reinvent these either:
They had gone away into the plot of a story,
The “art” part—knowing what important details to leave out
And the way character is developed. Things too real
To be of much concern, hence artificial, yet now all over the page,
The indoors with the outside becoming part of you
As you find you had never left off laughing at death,
The background, dark vine at the edge of the porch.",The book is about a woman who loses her husband in a car crash. The book is set in Paris in the 1930s and 1940s. It is about the author's attempts to write a novel about the death of her husband. The author also writes about the relationship between the author and her character.,"In 'Forties Flick,' John Ashbery describes the unique setting of the classic 1940s film noir in order to express his nostalgia regarding those crime dramas. This poem portrays the claustrophobic interiors, oblique and vertical lines (especially in regards to lights and shadows), and urban environments of the American film noir. Ashbery describes these things by using the images of “Venetian blind on the painted wall,” “Shadows of the snake-plant and cacti, the plaster animals,” etc. Another unique characteristic of the black and white classic crime dramas that he depicts in the poem is the infamous femme fatale in the line “In bra and panties she sidles to the window.” Ashbery also critiques the movie genre by saying that they have similar endings: “Why must it always end this way?” According to him, several still and silent scenes in the library or of the telephone are lost in the plot and signify little. Whatsoever, Ashbery also appreciates the artistic skills it takes to make those films, i.e., to leave out specific details and to maintain the air of secrecy and mystery, which was crucial for these movies."

when, with elation

Give bread. Give back your heart to the stranger, who has loved you all your life.","Love After Love by Derek Walcott is a poem, made up of four stanzas, that is presented in the form of a person offering advice to someone who is distressed. Within those four stanzas, readers can infer that the distress comes from a bad relationship that either has ended or should end and that the person hearing this advice is still suffering from the sadness of the experience. Regardless, Walcott assures this person—this “you”—that not only will things get better, but that the overall state of things will improve in the wake of this relationship. The reason for this seems to be the main theme of the poem as the speaker insists, again and again, that who this person has become does not accurately represent who they truly are, but one day, their true self will return. On that day, they will be happy again since only in embracing who they are can they fully be content."
175,"King Francis was a hearty king, and loved a royal sport,
And one day as his lions fought, sat looking on the court;
The nobles filled the benches, and the ladies in their pride,
And 'mongst them sat the Count de Lorge, with one for whom he sighed:
And truly 'twas a gallant thing to see that crowning show,
Valour and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below.
Ramped and roared the lions, with horrid laughing jaws;
They bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind went with their paws;
With wallowing might and stifled roar they rolled on one another;
Till all the pit with sand and mane was in a thunderous smother;
The bloody foam above the bars came whisking through the air;
Said Francis then, ""Faith, gentlemen, we're better here than there.""
De Lorge's love o'erheard the King, a beauteous lively dame
With smiling lips and sharp bright eyes, which always seemed the same;
She thought, the Count my lover is brave as brave can be;
He surely would do wondrous things to show his love of me;
King, ladies, lovers, all look on; the occasion is divine;
I'll drop my glove, to prove his love; great glory will be mine.
She dropped her glove, to prove his love, then looked at him and smiled;
He bowed, and in a moment leaped among the lions wild:
The leap was quick, return was quick, he has regained his place,
Then threw the glove, but not with love, right in the lady's face.
""By God!"" said Francis, ""rightly done!"" and he rose from where he sat:
""No love,"" quoth he, ""but vanity, sets love a task like that.""","King Francis was a hearty king, and loved a royal sport. The lions bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind went with their paws. With wallowing might and stifled roar they rolled on one another. The bloody foam above the bars came whisking through the air.","'The Glove and the Lions' by Leigh Hunt describes the dangerous games of love that are played in the royal court of the king, and the consequences of going too far. The poem begins with the speaker describing the event that the royal court, the king included, are attending. It is a fight between two lions and all are there to see it play out. The king himself, Francis, is a fan of this particular “sport,” but his attention is split. He is amazed by the brutality of the fight and the fact that he is able to observe it from safety. On the other hand, he is distracted by the beauty of one for whom he “sighs.” She is the lover of another lord. The lady herself is distracted by the valor of the king and decided to set a task for her lover. She drops her glove into the lion pit in the hopes that he will jump in and retrieve it for her. He does just this but is not pleased with her actions. He throws her glove in her face and leaves the arena. He does not believe that any true lover would set “such a task.”"

Tolkien is a joyous poem that celebrates the return to Rivendell of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins after his journey to Erebor. Sung by the elves, this poem is uplifting. Tolkien uses natural imagery to create a lovely scene. The elves sing for the return of their friend, asking that all join in in the festivities. There is dancing and singing. In the third and fourth stanzas everything quiets down and it's time to allow Bilbo to get some rest."

Of delicate things to eat;

The poem begins with the narrator begging the winter to stay.

The narrator states that he knows what all these signs mean and that he knows that spring has arrived. He then again begs winter to stay and begins describing his homeland. He states that he fled a tropical landscape, where it is always hot and palm trees grow. His familiarity with this kind of climate makes him yearn for the calm cold months."
179,"You said: “I’ll go to another country, go to another shore,

Cavafy begins by focusing on the speech of 'You', Cavafy directly quoting from the person he is talking to. This person, although unknown, could be Cavafy talking directly to himself, trying to snap out of the rhetoric that tell him to simply run form his problems. The first stanza of the poem sets out what is going on, with the quoted speaker deciding that his mind has gone soft living in the city he does, seeking escape. The speaker suggests that it is not their fault that their years have been wasted, putting the blame onto the city that they live within. The second stanza of the poem replies to the speaker of the first, undoing this ridiculous notion. Cavafy suggests that it is not the city that has lead to this 'waste' of life, but rather the speaker themselves having wasted their time. Changing the city will not change the mindset of this person, with Cavafy suggesting that they must instead alter their outlook on life for anything to change. Again, change comes from within, it is not something you can force through a radical change of locations. "

The poem takes the reader through “feeding time” in the geriatric ward of a hospital and the opinions of doctors and nurses. The speaker depicts the residents of the ward as cabbages and mindless cells at which they blow oxygen. She very clearly sees this period in one's life as torturous and purposeless. The speaker advocates, in varying degrees of authenticity, for an end to prolonged life."

Each stanza contains six lines. The line length is similar throughout the poem but the amount of syllables varies from line to line giving the poem a stilted feel, this possibly helps to represent the up and down nature of having an affair. The subject of the poem is comedic but it's really a black comedy. The tone, therefore, is light hearted but a little shocking in places. Rhyme is used throughout the poem and this helps to emphasize the humorous nature of the poem. The rhyme pattern for the first two stanzas utilizes end rhymes every other line (-A-A-A) but in the final stanza, it appears to be (ABABAB) although some of the rhymes throughout are half-rhymes."

'Whoso List to Hunt' by Sir Thomas Wyatt is a sonnet that talks about a hind that is impossible to be captured. In the first section or octave, the poet refers to his mental state after following the hind before. It was a fruitless venture that he undertook. Neither he nor others can catch it. The poet became so exhausted that he says it was like catching air with a net. It soon becomes evident the deer is a woman and the speaker: one of her suitors. However, in the sestet, the poet provides the reason. Here, he says why the hind can't be caught. As it belongs to Caesar, a likely reference to Henry VIII and already his property. So, those who are trying to catch it, can't own the creature."

In peace there's nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility. But when the blast of war blows in our ears, then imitate the action of the tiger.","Henry gives his men a stark choice: either summon the energy to push through the breach or give up, die and leave it to be filled with the corpses of the “English dead.” He reminds them that there is no room for the “modest stillness and humility” that might be useful in peacetime. Instead, they must “imitate the action of the tiger” and make themselves think and look physically terrifying, by using their full height, baring their teeth, and flaring their nostrils. He advises them to make their eyes look like a “brass cannon” peaking out from a warship and to hold their foreheads high and “fearfully” so they appear like an angry cliff or “galled rock” over the ocean. In the second part of the 'Once more unto the breach' speech, Henry flatters his men, the “noblest English” and urges them to “Dishonour not your mothers” and make their families proud of them by being “men of grosser blood” who are ready for war. By the time the speech ends, the soldiers are ready to storm Harfleur and charge through its walls on Henry's famous rallying cry, “God for Harry, for England and St George!”"
184,"They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens,
And along the trampled edges of the street
I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids
Sprouting despondently at area gates.

The brown waves of fog toss up to me
Twisted faces from the bottom of the street,
And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts
An aimless smile that hovers in the air
And vanishes along the level of the roofs.","They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens. And along the trampled edges of the street, I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids. The brown waves of fog toss up to me. And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts. An aimless smile that hovers in the air. And vanishes along the level of the roofs.",‘Morning at the Window’ by T. S. Eliot depicts the impressions of the lyrical voice as he looks outside his window and observes the streets.
185,"I
Lord of the universe
Master of destruction,
I stand before you
Unwilling to be cowered.
Have you ever felt
The bones of your child prod your palm?
Have you ever heard
The piercing wail of hunger?
II
I have appeased
The demands of my calling.
I have chanted your name
A million times and more.
And yet, my ancestors will return
Ghouls hungry for the crumbs of my guilt.
For they know when I forsake you
I forsake them.
III
I shall no longer gather shoe flowers,
Hide the blackness of your tumescence
With the red petals of hope
That bud, blossom and die in these courtyards.
No lamp will burn as your all seeing eye.
No camphor breath of yours will singe these walls.
Never again will I pretend that you exist.
Your blessings are ashes that stick in my throat.
IV
One last time
I plunged into the green pond.
Slime infested tears of men chosen as I was.
One last time I held the thread that bound you to me.
Let this then be my parting curse:
May you live trapped in your slumber.
And when I am gone, none shall awaken you
No bells shall ever ring for you.","I have appeased the demands of my calling. I have chanted your name a million times and more. But my ancestors will return. Ghouls hungry for the crumbs of my guilt. I will no longer gather shoe flowers,Hide the blackness of your tumescence with red petals of hope.","Form and Tone May You Sleep A Million Years, Shiva is interesting in so much as it is divided up into five separate sections, or stanzas, but each of these numbered sections appears to be subdivided into two further sections. Each of the stanzas is eight lines long. There is no pattern in line length or amount of syllables used giving the poem an uneven meter. The poem has quite an angry tone. It is full of emotions as the narrator addresses Shiva who is one of Hinduism'se most prominent and important deities."
186,"""The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright —
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.
The moon was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
After the day was done —
""It's very rude of him,"" she said,
""To come and spoil the fun.""
The sea was wet as wet could be,
The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overhead —
There were no birds to fly.
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand;
They wept like anything to see
Such quantities of sand:
If this were only cleared away,'
They said, it would be grand!'
If seven maids with seven mops
Swept it for half a year,
Do you suppose,' the Walrus said,
That they could get it clear?'
I doubt it,' said the Carpenter,
And shed a bitter tear.
O Oysters, come and walk with us!'
The Walrus did beseech.
A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
Along the briny beach:
We cannot do with more than four,
To give a hand to each.'
The eldest Oyster looked at him,
But never a word he said:
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
And shook his heavy head —
Meaning to say he did not choose
To leave the oyster-bed.
But four young Oysters hurried up,
All eager for the treat:
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
Their shoes were clean and neat —
And this was odd, because, you know,
They hadn't any feet.
Four other Oysters followed them,
And yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more —
All hopping through the frothy waves,
And scrambling to the shore.
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
Conveniently low:
And all the little Oysters stood
And waited in a row.
The time has come,' the Walrus said,
To talk of many things:
Of shoes — and ships — and sealing-wax —
Of cabbages — and kings —
And why the sea is boiling hot —
And whether pigs have wings.'
But wait a bit,' the Oysters cried,
Before we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath,
And all of us are fat!'
No hurry!' said the Carpenter.
They thanked him much for that.
A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said,
Is what we chiefly need:
Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed —
Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,
We can begin to feed.'
But not on us!' the Oysters cried,
Turning a little blue.
After such kindness, that would be
A dismal thing to do!'
The night is fine,' the Walrus said.
Do you admire the view?
It was so kind of you to come!
And you are very nice!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
Cut us another slice:
I wish you were not quite so deaf —
I've had to ask you twice!'
It seems a shame,' the Walrus said,
To play them such a trick,
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them trot so quick!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
The butter's spread too thick!'
I weep for you,' the Walrus said:
I deeply sympathize.'
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes.
O Oysters,' said the Carpenter,
You've had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?'
But answer came there none —
And this was scarcely odd, because
They'd eaten every one.""","""The sun was shining on the sea, with the billows smooth and bright"" ""The sea was wet as wet could be, and the sands were dry as dry."" ""The moon was shining sulkily, because she thought the sun had got no business to be there"" ""And the night was fine, because there were no birds to fly""","The Walrus and the Carpenter' by Lewis Carroll contains the unusual story of a walk down the beach and the characters that take it. The poem begins with the Walrus and his companion the carpenter mourning the presence of so much sand on the beach. They cry over it, unable to come up with a good way to get rid of it. As quickly as their tears began they stop and begin speaking with some oysters. These oysters walk with them, although they do not have legs, down the beach. They pause, decide to have a discussion, and then decide to eat. It is at this point that there is a change in the poem and it is revealed that the two tricked the oysters into coming with them in order to eat them. They distract them the best they can and then eat them all before they remember to apologize."
187,"One day you finally knew
what you had to do, and began,
though the voices around you
kept shouting
their bad advice --
though the whole house
began to tremble
and you felt the old tug
at your ankles.

each voice cried.
But you didn't stop.
You knew what you had to do,
though the wind pried
with its stiff fingers
at the very foundations,
though their melancholy
was terrible.
It was already late
enough, and a wild night,
and the road full of fallen
branches and stones.
But little by little,
as you left their voice behind,
the stars began to burn
through the sheets of clouds,
and there was a new voice
which you slowly
recognized as your own,
that kept you company
as you strode deeper and deeper
into the world,
determined to do
the only thing you could do --
determined to save
the only life that you could save.","One day you finally knew                what you had to do, and began.

But little by little, as you left their voice behind, the stars began to burn through the sheets of clouds.","'The Journey' by Mary Oliver tells of the emotional and mental turmoil someone endured to end one unhealthy life and begin anew in a different world. In the first lines of this piece the speaker addresses “you”. The second person narration means that the reader is included in the poem. They are part of the story and are therefore asked to consider themselves within the same situation as the intended listener. The speaker describes how this person reached a point in their life when they knew “what they had to do”. Voices follow this person, trying to get them to return to the past and focus on them instead. But, this listener does not give in. They continue to move forward and brave the uneven path that is set out before them. The speaker states that it was “already late enough”. The listener had wasted enough of their life paying attention to the voices. Now there is no time to spare in moving into the new world. Once the old voice has dissipated, “you” were able to hear a new voice. It took a moment to realize that this voice was “your own”. The listener moves away from the world they knew, and “deeper and deeper” into a new one. The only thing they have on their mind at this point is to save their own life."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he knows about the nature of the mouse. It is small and scared of the presence of humans. The speaker understands why this is the case and sympathizes. He goes on to describe the winds which destroyed the mouse's labored over home and how it is now without shelter for the winter. In the final lines, he relates the mouse's predicament to that experienced by all of humankind. One's plans are liable to go awry, no matter how hard one plans for the future."
189,"Our England is a garden that is full of stately views,
 Of borders, beds and shrubberies and lawns and avenues,
 With statues on the terraces and peacocks strutting by;
 But the Glory of the Garden lies in more than meets the eye. 

For where the old thick laurels grow, along the thin red wall,
 You’ll find the tool- and potting-sheds which are the heart of all,
 The cold-frames and the hot-houses, the dungpits and the tanks,
 The rollers, carts and drain-pipes, with the barrows and the planks. 

And there you’ll see the gardeners, the men and ’Prentice boys
 Told off to do as they are bid and do it without noise;
 For, except when seeds are planted and we shout to scare the birds,
 The Glory of the Garden it abideth not in words. 

And some can pot begonias and some can bud a rose,
 And some are hardly fit to trust with anything that grows;
 But they can roll and trim the lawns and sift the sand and loam,
 For the Glory of the Garden occupieth all who come. 

Our England is a garden, and such gardens are not made
 By singing:—“Oh, how beautiful!” and sitting in the shade,
 While better men than we go out and start their working lives
 At grubbing weeds from gravel-paths with broken dinner-knives. 

There’s not a pair of legs so thin, there’s not a head so thick,
 There’s not a hand so weak and white, nor yet a heart so sick,
 But it can find some needful job that’s crying to be done,
 For the Glory of the Garden glorifieth every one. 

Then seek your job with thankfulness and work till further orders,
 If it’s only netting strawberries or killing slugs on borders;
 And when your back stops aching and your hands begin to harden,
 You will find yourself a partner in the Glory of the Garden. 

Oh, Adam was a gardener, and God who made him sees
 That half a proper gardener’s work is done upon his knees,
 So when your work is finished, you can wash your hands and pray
 For the Glory of the Garden that it may not pass away!
And the Glory of the Garden it shall never pass away!","Our England is a garden that is full of stately views, with borders, beds and shrubberies and lawns and avenues. But the Glory of the Garden lies in more than meets the eye. Along the thin red wall, you’ll find the tool- and potting-sheds.","'The Glory of the Garden' by Rudyard Kipling describes England through the extended metaphor of a well-loved, well-cared-for garden. The poem begins with the speaker describing England as a garden with “stately views”. It has beautiful shrubs and peacocks, but there are also tool sheds and more practical structures. In amongst these sites, a visitor will see the gardeners, every one of which has a different job that is suited perfectly for them. Some might tend to the growing plants while others move soil and sand. They are also pleasant, quiet, and ready to do as they are asks. These are the hardworking citizens of the country, doing what they can to contribute to the greater good of their homeland. Kipling's speaker also makes sure to emphasize the fact that everyone has a job and is therefore occupied by the garden. There is no one who is sitting around and relaxes, everyone contributes. The last stanzas are directed at the reader or listener, telling them that they too need to make sure that they're doing everything they can for the country. It might be hard work at first, but eventually, one's hands will grow strong and their backs, painless. They too will be brought into the glory of the garden, and therefore the glory of God."
190,"Shall I follow the stream
Or cross the sea,
Strive for a dream
Or let life be?

Shall it be neon lights
That spell sucess,
Or flickering lamplight

What does it mean to be happy? What are the meanings of life and love?","‘Crossroads’ by Ocean MisT is a short, simple poem that embodies the very human argument between the head and the heart. Throughout the poem, the speaker presents the reader with a series of questions. Beneath the different images, there are two distinct possibilities for their future. Either they should ford new ground or follow a pre-made path that leads to simple happiness."
191,"Starting here, what do you want to remember?
How sunlight creeps along a shining floor?
What scent of old wood hovers, what softened

for time to show you some better thoughts?

This poem begins with a set of natural imagery. For example, Stafford refers to the creeping of sunlight on the floor, the scent of old wood, and the soft sounds that fill the air. By referring to these images, he sets the mood of the poem. Moving on to the following lines, his speaker highlights the fact that the most important gift of our lives is the air we breathe. One has to respect that gift without thinking about any worldly rewards. The moment people wait for never comes. It is up to them how they try to find exceptional satisfaction in the most ordinary of moments."
192,"Tis fine to see the Old World and travel up and down
Among the famous palaces and cities of renown,
To admire the crumblyh castles and the statues and kings
But now I think I've had enough of antiquated things.

So it's home again, and home again, America for me!
My heart is turning home again and there I long to be,
In the land of youth and freedom, beyond the ocean bars,
Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of stars.

Oh, London is a man's town, there's power in the air;
And Paris is a woman's town, with flowers in her hair;
And it's sweet to dream in Venice, and it's great to study Rome;
But when it comes to living there is no place like home.

I like the German fir-woods in green battalions drilled;
I like the gardens of Versailles with flashing foutains filled;
But, oh, to take your had, my dear, and ramble for a day
In the friendly western woodland where Nature has her sway!

I know that Europe's wonderful, yet something seems to lack!
The Past is too much with her, and the people looking back.
But the glory of the Present is to make the Future free-
We love our land for what she is and what she is to be.

Oh, it's home again, and home again, America for me!

In the first lines of this poem, the speaker describes how they've been traveling around Europe and are thrilled to be on their way home to the United States. They live there and feel that the country has something to offer that all European countries do not. It is looking towards the future while Europe is stuck in the past. The poem ends with a repetition of some of the poem's more memorable lines."
193,"When I was one,
I had just begun.
When I was two,
I was nearly new.
When I was three,
I was hardly me.

I was not much more.

I was just alive.

A. Milne's work, there is an element to the poetry which is only going to be truly accessible to an adult reader. In this case, it is the theme of identity and a search for satisfaction in that identity. This plays out very clearly in lines 1-10 of 'Now We Are Six.' The young child speaking is experiencing what every member of the human race goes through as they age, a process of seeking, learning, and hopefully becoming wiser. There is a youthful ignorance contained within 'Now We Are Six' that is charming. This child is still under the impression that they will reach an age in which everything is perfect. They believe it is at “six” that they want to remain for the rest of their life. Perhaps at that moment they really believed that, but with the further shifting of time, landscapes, people, and attitudes they, along with everyone else aging, will come to realize that there is no one perfect year."

Flint describes one speaker's love for the city of London and how he feels the city improves others and himself. The poem begins with the speaker listing out a number of things that are special about London, but are not the reasons he cares so much about “her.” He speaks of the sunsets and the “pale green sky.” Although these things are beautiful, they are not special. In the second half, the narrator comes to the moment he loves. He speaks of the moon rising over the city and lighting up the tops of the trees. When this happens he is determined to climb to the top of the trees and bask in the moonlight. His “blood” will be cooled by this action and his whole spirit lifted. "
195,"Oh, but it is dirty!
—this little filling station,
oil-soaked, oil-permeated
to a disturbing, over-all
black translucency.
Be careful with that match!

Father wears a dirty,
oil-soaked monkey suit
that cuts him under the arms,
and several quick and saucy
and greasy sons assist him

all quite thoroughly dirty.

Do they live in the station?

a set of crushed and grease-
impregnated wickerwork;

a dirty dog, quite comfy.

She is at first bothered by the presence of a number of elements which tells of the family's financial situation. It is clear they live there due to the presence of a porch, chairs, and By the end of the poem, the speaker comes to the conclusion, after seeing the love given to a few parts of the home, that there is a reason to love everything and everyone.

196,"Hello! What's all this here? A kitschy vase
some Shirley Temple manqué has knocked out
delineating tales of kids in cars
on crap estates, the Burberry clad louts
who flail their motors through the smoky night
from Manchester to Motherwell or Slough,
creating bedlam on the Queen's highway.
Your gaudy evocation can, somehow,
conjure the scene without inducing fright,
as would a Daily Express exposé,
can bring to mind the throaty turbo roar
of hatchbacks tuned almost to breaking point,
the joyful throb of UK garage or
of house imported from the continent
and yet educe a sense of peace, of calm -
the screech of tyres and the nervous squeals
of girls, too young to quite appreciate
the peril they are in, are heard, but these wheels
will not lose traction, skid and flip, no harm
befall these children. They will stay out late

forever, pumped on youth and ecstasy,
on alloy, bass and arrogance, and speed
the back lanes, the urban gyratory,
the wide motorways, never having need
to race back home, for work next day, to bed.
Each girl is buff, each geezer toned and strong,
charged with pulsing juice which, even yet,
fills every pair of Calvin’s and each thong,
never to be deflated, given head
in crude games of chlamydia roulette.

Now see who comes to line the sparse grass verge,
to toast them in Buckfast and Diamond White:
rat-boys and corn-rowed cheerleaders who urge
them on to pull more burn-outs or to write
their donut Os, as signature, upon
the bleached tarmac of dead suburban streets.
There dogs set up a row and curtains twitch
as pensioners and parents telephone
the cops to plead for quiet, sue for peace -
tranquility, though, is for the rich.
And so, millennia hence, you garish crock,
when all context is lost, galleries razed
to level dust and we're long in the box,
will future poets look on you amazed,
speculate how children might have lived when
you were fired, lives so free and bountiful
and there, beneath a sun a little colder,
declare How happy were those creatures then,
who knew the truth was all negotiable
and beauty in the gift of the beholder.","Children in cars on crap estates, the Burberry clad louts, flail their motors through the smoky night.

The lines conform to a rhyming pattern of ABABCDEDCE, changing end sounds from stanza to stanza. Turnbull also chose to make use of a very traditional rhyme scheme, iambic pentameter. This means that each line is separated into five sets of two beats. The first of these is unstressed and the second stressed. This is the same form used by Keats in ‘Ode to a Grecian Urn.’ His poem follows the same rhyme scheme and is also written in iambic pentameter. Both poems, as stated in the title, are “odes.” An ode is a kind of lyric poetry that is sometimes meant to be sung. It is generally addressed to a natural subject and formatted in a specific kind of meter."
197,"A man was dancing with the wrong woman
in the wrong bar, the wrong part of town.
He must have chosen the woman, the place,
as keenly as you choose what to wear
when you dress to kill.
And the woman, who could have said no,
must have made her choice years ago,
to look like the kind of trouble

the dancing was wrong. I’d forgotten
how fragile the face is, how fists too
are just so many small bones.
The bouncer waited, then broke in.
Someone wiped up the blood.
The woman began to dance
with another woman, each in tight jeans.
The air pulsed. My hands
were fidgety, damp.
We were Mexicans, Indians, whites.
The woman was part this, part that.
My friend said nothing’s wrong, stay put,
it’s a good fighting bar, you won’t get hurt
unless you need to get hurt.","A man was dancing with the wrong woman                in the wrong bar, the wrong part of town. He must have chosen the woman, the place,                as keenly as you choose what to wear                when you dress to kill. The woman, who could have said no, must have made her choice years ago,                to look like the kind of troublecertain men choose as their own.","'Tucson' by Stephen Dunn is an interesting narrative poem that depicts a bar fight between two men, one of whom was violating social norms. The poem begins with a description of all the “wrong” things that one man did. He chose the wrong woman, the wrong bar, and the wrong part of town. These were all conscious choices on his part. He knew that by going where he went with whom he went with that, he'd be asking for a fight. That's exactly what happened. The poem ends with one of the men in the bar suggesting that people come to the bar because it's a “good fighting bar,” but you won't get hurt unless you need to."

And the beautiful kimono you wore
When you sat on the couch
With that tigerish crouch
And told me you loved me no more.

In the first stanza of this poem, readers come across an image of a lady dressed in a kimono and flowers. She is sitting in a crouch like a tiger waiting for its prey. Unfortunately, the prey is none other than the speaker himself. The lady told him that she had no feelings left in her heart. It was better to leave. The years fled by. In the present, when he thinks of his past, he does not feel like before. One's youthful years spurs passionate emotions in the heart. But when the person matures, he takes decisions carefully."

Amoretti was published in 1595, and it depicts Spenser’s courtship and eventual marriage to Elizabeth Boyle. In Sonnet 54, Spenser uses the theatre to describe his situation as a lover; the lyrical voice is the actor who plays various roles and his loved one is the unmoved spectator. Thus, Sonnet 54 is a conceit that relates the lyrical voice’s actions to that of the theatre.

Sonnet 54 is a Spenserian sonnet, formed by three interlocked quatrains and a couplet. The rhyme scheme is ABAB BCBC CDCD EE and it has iambic pentameter. The main theme in Sonnet 54 is unreciprocated love and the tone of the poem shows the lyrical voice’s frustration passing through annoyance and anger."
200,"The fish are dreadful. They are brought up
the mountain in the dawn most days, beautiful
and alien and cold from night under the sea,
the grand rooms fading from their flat eyes.
Soft machinery of the dark, the man thinks,
washing them. ""What can you know of my machinery!""
demands the Lord. Sure, the man says quietly
and cuts into them, laying back the dozen struts,
getting to the muck of something terrible.

to live this way. I build cities where things
are human. I make Tuscany and you go to live
with rock and silence."" The man washes away
the blood and arranges the fish on a big plate.

in peppers. ""You have lived all year without women.""
He takes out everything and puts in the fish.
""No one knows where you are. People forget you.
You are vain and stubborn."" The man slices
tomatoes and lemons. Takes out the fish
and scrambles eggs. I am not stubborn, he thinks,
laying all of it on the table in the courtyard

on the food. Not stubborn, just greedy.","The fish are dreadful. They are beautiful and alien and cold from night under the sea. The man washes away the blood and arranges the fish on a big plate. ""You have lived all year without women,"" the Lord says. ""No one knows where you are.

This man is going insane, having retreated from society to live by himself. Instead of doing this out of being 'stubborn', he believes it is due to 'greed', wanting to live his life among nature. The poem could be understood as a debate between the rejection and acceptance of nature, the man ignoring humanity in order to be closer to nature."

This poem begins with the imagery of blood. The speaker describes how he hanged the “five-point mule deer” in an old barn. Its blood resembled that of Christ. The same innocence can be seen in their eyes. It reminds the speaker of the history of Native Americans. Being an indigenous representative, he describes how the white men used religion to unite and colonize the natives without spilling more blood."

In the first lines of this poem, the speaker begins by describing an old woman eating plums. She has a bag of them and is eating them one at a time, enjoying every moment of the experience. She's poor, meaning that she is likely more accustomed to encountering troubles in her everyday life than another person of greater economic means. This makes the experience all the more powerful. She's completely engaged with the moment and enjoying the taste of the ripe fruit."
204,"We were a people taut for war; the hills
Were no harder, the thin grass
Clothed them more warmly than the coarse
Shirts our small bones.
We fought, and were always in retreat,
Like snow thawing upon the slopes
Of Mynydd Mawr; and yet the stranger
Never found our ultimate stand
In the thick woods, declaiming verse
To the sharp prompting of the harp.
Our kings died, or they were slain
By the old treachery at the ford.
Our bards perished, driven from the halls
Of nobles by the thorn and bramble.
We were a people bred on legends,
Warming our hands at the red past.
The great were ashamed of our loose rags
Clinging stubbornly to the proud tree
Of blood and birth, our lean bellies
And mud houses were a proof
Of our ineptitude for life.
We were a people wasting ourselves
In fruitless battles for our masters,
In lands to which we had no claim,
With men for whom we felt no hatred.
We were a people, and are so yet.
When we have finished quarrelling for crumbs
Under the table, or gnawing the bones
Of a dead culture, we will arise
And greet each other in a new dawn.","We were a people taut for war; the hills were no harder, the thin grass more warmly than the coarse shirts our small bones.

Thomas creates a narrative for the reader that directly engages them with the troubled history of Wales, how its people fought endless battles and lived on very little. The Welsh lost and regained their history through legends, and even when they were thought of as undeserving of life, maintained their strength to fight against those that would take their homes from them. The poem ends on a hopeful note in which the Welsh no longer have to beg under the table for scraps or “[gnaw] the bones / Of a dead culture.” They will arise from their destitute state and create a modern culture fuelled by their past."

Unscorned the food of the plebeian race?

Upon thy splendid rounded purple breasts.","O patient creature with a peasant face,  purposefullyBurnt by the summer sun, begrimed with stains,                 And standing humbly in the dingy lanes!                 There seems a mystery in thy work and place,                  Which crowns thee with significance and grace.","'Milkweed' by Helen Hunt Jackson is a beautiful poem that talks about the milkweed flowers and why the poet prefers this flower the most.

According to her, there seems a mystery in its origin. The milk that runs through its veins has divine importance in her eyes. With the glorification of the plant the first section ends. Thereafter, in the next section, the poet depicts some butterflies that throng near the flowers of the milkweed plant. They seem to her like jewels sparkling in the sunlight."
206,"Hail to thee, blithe Spirit!
Bird thou never wert,
That from Heaven, or near it,
Pourest thy full heart
In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.
Higher still and higher
From the earth thou springest
Like a cloud of fire;
The blue deep thou wingest,
And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.
In the golden lightning
Of the sunken sun,
O'er which clouds are bright'ning,
Thou dost float and run;
Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.
The pale purple even
Melts around thy flight;
Like a star of Heaven,
In the broad day-light
Thou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delight,
Keen as are the arrows
Of that silver sphere,
Whose intense lamp narrows
In the white dawn clear
Until we hardly see, we feel that it is there.
All the earth and air
With thy voice is loud,
As, when night is bare,
From one lonely cloud
The moon rains out her beams, and Heaven is overflow'd.
What thou art we know not;
What is most like thee?
From rainbow clouds there flow not
Drops so bright to see
As from thy presence showers a rain of melody.
Like a Poet hidden
In the light of thought,
Singing hymns unbidden,
Till the world is wrought
To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not:
Like a high-born maiden
In a palace-tower,
Soothing her love-laden
Soul in secret hour
With music sweet as love, which overflows her bower:
Like a glow-worm golden
In a dell of dew,
Scattering unbeholden
Its aëreal hue
Among the flowers and grass, which screen it from the view:
Like a rose embower'd
In its own green leaves,
By warm winds deflower'd,
Till the scent it gives
Makes faint with too much sweet those heavy-winged thieves:
Sound of vernal showers
On the twinkling grass,
Rain-awaken'd flowers,
All that ever was
Joyous, and clear, and fresh, thy music doth surpass.
Teach us, Sprite or Bird,
What sweet thoughts are thine:
I have never heard
Praise of love or wine
That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.
Chorus Hymeneal,
Or triumphal chant,
Match'd with thine would be all
But an empty vaunt,
A thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want.
What objects are the fountains
Of thy happy strain?
What fields, or waves, or mountains?
What shapes of sky or plain?
What love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain?
With thy clear keen joyance
Languor cannot be:
Shadow of annoyance
Never came near thee:
Thou lovest: but ne'er knew love's sad satiety.
Waking or asleep,
Thou of death must deem
Things more true and deep
Than we mortals dream,
Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?
We look before and after,
And pine for what is not:
Our sincerest laughter
With some pain is fraught;
Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
Yet if we could scorn
Hate, and pride, and fear;
If we were things born
Not to shed a tear,
I know not how thy joy we ever should come near.
Better than all measures
Of delightful sound,
Better than all treasures
That in books are found,
Thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground!
Teach me half the gladness
That thy brain must know,
Such harmonious madness
From my lips would flow
The world should listen then, as I am listening now.","Hail to thee, blithe Spirit! Bird thou never wert,                Pourest thy full heart in profuse strains of unpremeditated art. From the earth thou springest like a cloud of fire; the blue deep thou wingest, and singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.","'To a Skylark' by Percy Bysshe Shelley is an ode to the “blithe” essence of a singing skylark and how human beings are unable to ever reach that same bliss. The poem begins with the speaker spotting a skylark flying above him. He can hear the song clearly. The bird's song “unpremeditated” is unplanned and beautiful. Shelley is stunned by the music produced by the bird and entranced by its movement as it flies into the clouds and out of sight. Although he can no longer see it, he is still able to hear it and feel its presence. The bird represents the pure, unbridled happiness that Shelley is desperately seeking. This desperation comes through in the next stanzas. The poet then embarks on a number of metaphors through which he is hoping to better understand what the bird is and what he can accurately compare it to. He sees the bird as a “high-born maiden” that serenades her lover below her and spring, or “vernal,” showers that rain on the flowers below. The skylark is like “rainbow clouds” and the epitome of all “Joyous” things. The next section of the ode is used to ask the skylark to reveal what inspires it to sing such a glorious song. Is it, the poet asks, “fields, or waves, or mountains?” Could it be, he speculates, “shapes of sky or plain?” Whatever it may be, Shelley has never seen anything that could force such sounds from his own voice. He states that for a creature to have the ability to sing in such a way, it must know nothing of sorrow or “annoyance.” The bird must have the ability to see beyond life, understand death, and feel no concern about it. This is why humans may never reach the same state of happiness that the skylark exists within. “We” pine for things that we do not have, and even our “sweetest songs” are full of the “saddest thought[s].” 'To a Skylark' concludes with the poet pleading with the bird to “Teach [him] half the gladness / That thy brain must know.” Even that small amount would provide Shelley with the ability to produce “harmonious madness” that would force the world to listen to him must as raptly as he is listening to the skylark now."

the one whose head Shiva stole
to bring his son Ganesh
back to life?
This is child’s curiosity,
The rosy imagination

probing, looking for a way

of a beheaded elephant
lying crumpled up
on its side, covered with bird shit,
vulture shit-

for Ganesh,
he dies, of course, but the others
in his heard, the hundreds
in his family must have found him.

with their slow swaying sadness…

in a circle, with their trunks
facing outwards and then inwards
toward the headless one.

a group dance
no one talks about.","What happend to the elephant whose head Shiva stole to bring his son Ganesh back to life? This is child’s curiosity, that continues to look for a way to prolong the story.

In the first part of this poem, the speaker begins by conveying the curious questions of a child who is trying to understand the Hindu story of how Ganesh lost his head and gained the head of an elephant. The child wonders what happened to the elephant who gave a head and if it was possible to give the elephant a new head as well, perhaps a horse's head. Unintentionally inspired by the child's probings, the adult narrator takes the story further in imagines the sorrow that the elephant's family would experience upon seeing their fellow heard member decapitated and killed."

neighbors surrounded his house

The poem opens with a description of his white neighbors coming to burn down his house, believing it was their right to drive him out of their neighborhood. The poem progresses into more personal territory, alluding to the close relationship between the poet as a boy and his aging grandfather."

Tightly-folded bud,
I have wished you something
None of the others would:
Not the usual stuff
About being beautiful,
Or running off a spring
Of innocence and love —
They will all wish you that,

Well, you’re a lucky girl.

But if it shouldn’t, then
May you be ordinary;
Have, like other women,
An average of talents:
Not ugly, not good-looking,
Nothing uncustomary
To pull you off your balance,
That, unworkable itself,
Stops all the rest from working.

She also writes about her relationship with the man she fell in with. For more of Sally Amis' work click here.","One literary analyst describes Larkin’s works: ‘Born Yesterday’. She says, “the topic of happiness—what it is, how to attain and cultivate it—is crucial to his work”. This topic is particularly obvious in ‘Born Yesterday. Larkin seems to hint that he has found a source of true happiness, and that it has nothing to do with beauty, talent, or fame. Therefore, he wishes this young girl to be plain and average, that she might achieve happiness in life.

The fact that Larkin seems to be so obsessed with the theme of happiness, could mean one of two things. Either he has found a source of true happiness, or he has simply found what is not the true source of happiness. Either way, this poem speaks volumes about life and meaning and purpose. While most people seem to think that beauty, money, fame, or intelligence is what makes a person worthwhile, Larkin points out the fallacy of this belief. He does this in a simple, yet profound way. He dedicates this poem to Sally Amis. This is the daughter of Larkin’s lifelong friend. Sally is clearly a child Larkin cares for dearly. Yet, he does not wish her to have all that the world has to offer. Rather, he wishes for her to have a simple happiness, and he believes that she will find that happiness more readily if she is plain in looks and average in intelligence (Wetzsteon)."

In the first line of the poem, the speaker begins on a positive note, describing spring and life beginning. This may be interpreted as the speaker being pregnant. She goes on, informing the reader that her life is far from ideal. Her husband goes out, drunk or on drugs, every night and has sex with prostitutes. When he comes home, she has to fear for her life and do what she can to protect herself. In an effort to stay safe from her husband and try to keep her husband off the streets, she begins tying his car keys and a $10 bill to her thigh at night. Structure and Form 'To Speak of Woe That Is in Marriage' by Robert Lowell is a fourteen-line poem that is contained within a single stanza of text. The poem is written in the form of a fourteen-line sonnet with a rhyme scheme of AABBCCDDEEFFGG. This does not conform to any of the most popular, traditional rhyme schemes poets use in sonnet writing. But, it does have elements of both a Shakespearean and Petrarchan sonnet. For example, there is a clear transition between the eighth and ninth lines, similar to those seen in Petrarchan sonnets, and the poet uses couplets as both Shakespeare and Petrarch do in their sonnets."
213,"Earth has not any thing to show more fair:
Dull would he be of soul who could pass by
A sight so touching in its majesty:
This City now doth, like a garment, wear
The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie
Open unto the fields, and to the sky;
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.
Never did sun more beautifully steep
In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;
Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!
The river glideth at his own sweet will:
Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;
And all that mighty heart is lying still!","Earth has not any thing to show more fair:Dull would he be of soul who could pass by. Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep! The river glideth at his own sweet will:Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;And all that mighty heart is lying still!","In the early morning, the poet stands on Westminster Bridge, which connected the poor and the rich areas of London, and reminisces on the beauty of London in the early morning.

214,"BOOK I
A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
Its loveliness increases; it will never
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils
With the green world they live in; and clear rills
That for themselves a cooling covert make
'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms
We have imagined for the mighty dead;
All lovely tales that we have heard or read:
An endless fountain of immortal drink,
Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.
Nor do we merely feel these essences
For one short hour; no, even as the trees
That whisper round a temple become soon
Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon,
The passion poesy, glories infinite,
Haunt us till they become a cheering light
Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast,
That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast;
They always must be with us, or we die.
Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I
Will trace the story of Endymion.
The very music of the name has gone
Into my being, and each pleasant scene
Is growing fresh before me as the green
Of our own valleys: so I will begin
Now while I cannot hear the city's din;
Now while the early budders are just new,
And run in mazes of the youngest hue
About old forests; while the willow trails
Its delicate amber; and the dairy pails
Bring home increase of milk. And, as the year
Grows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer
My little boat, for many quiet hours,
With streams that deepen freshly into bowers.
Many and many a verse I hope to write,
Before the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white,
Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees
Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas,
I must be near the middle of my story.
O may no wintry season, bare and hoary,
See it half finish'd: but let Autumn bold,
With universal tinge of sober gold,
Be all about me when I make an end.
And now, at once adventuresome, I send
My herald thought into a wilderness:
There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress
My uncertain path with green, that I may speed
Easily onward, thorough flowers and weed.","The author has written a book of poetry about the story of Endymion. The book is called 'The Story of Endyion' and is set in the middle of the year. The author has also written a children's book about the same name, which he has also called 'Endymion'","The first book of “Endymion” by John Keats details the speaker's beliefs regarding the power of beauty and his intentions to tell the story of Endymion. The poem begins with the speaker describing, at length, the power he believes beauty holds over human life. He sees it as a guiding force that, when accepted and appreciated, enters into one's heart and helps to clear one's path through life. Once one fully knows beauty, it will never leave. It transforms the onlooker into a beautiful object. The second half of the poem describes the speaker's plan to tell the long story of Endymion, a character from Greek mythology. He announces his intentions, primes the audience for a long story, and sends out a “herald” to tell the world what is about to happen."
215,"My heart be brave, and do not falter so, Nor utter more that deep, despairing wail. Thy way is very dark and drear I know, But do not let thy strength and courage fail; For certain as the raven-winged night
Is followed by the bright and blushing morn, Thy coming morrow will be clear and bright; ’Tis darkest when the night is furthest worn. Look up, and out, beyond, surrounding clouds, And do not in thine own gross darkness grope, Rise up, and casting off thy hind’ring shrouds, Cling thou to this, and ever inspiring hope:
Tho’ thick the battle and tho’ fierce the fight,
There is a power making for the right.","My heart be brave, and do not falter so, Nor utter more that deep, despairing wail. Thy way is very dark and drear I know, But do not let thy strength and courage fail. For certain as the raven-winged nightIs followed by the bright and blushing morn.","Sonnet' by James Weldon Johnson is a simple, motivational poem that sees a speaker encourages his own heart to strive for bravery rather than fear. In the poem, Johnson addresses the unavoidable darkness and drear in the world. It's something that his speaker's heart as shied away from in the past. He asks his heart to confront it and remember that it's always darkest right before the morning comes. In the end, he concludes that the scariest and most terrible parts of the world may be pushed back by one who strives to do what's right."
216,"Just like as in a nest of boxes round,
Degrees of sizes in each box are found:
So, in this world, may many others be
Thinner and less, and less still by degree:
Although they are not subject to our sense,
A world may be no bigger than two-pence.
Nature is curious, and such works may shape,
Which our dull senses easily escape:
For creatures, small as atoms, may there be,
If every one a creature’s figure bear.
If atoms four, a world can make, then see
What several worlds might in an ear-ring be:
For, millions of those atoms may be in
The head of one small, little, single pin.
And if thus small, then ladies may well wear
A world of worlds, as pendents in each ear.","Just like as in a nest of boxes round the world, there are degrees of sizes in each box. Although they are not subject to our sense, a world may be no bigger than two-pence. And if thus small, then ladies may well wear a world of worlds, as pendents in each ear.","'Of Many Worlds in This World' by Margaret Cavendish describes the state of the world and how it contains an infinite number of smaller worlds. The speaker begins Of Many Worlds in This World by stating that the world is like a “nest of boxes.” It is made out of different-sized boxes, all placed within one another. This nesting of the world is a perfect metaphor for how the existence known to humankind lies on and within the existences of other organisms. These other worlds might be, the speaker describes, smaller than a human could ever see. They might be “Thinner and less” than anything yet known. This does not mean that they don't exist. It also doesn't mean they are not valuable or worth understanding. In the next set of lines, the speaker makes a comparison between the size of an imagined world and a “ladies ear-ring.” The “world” could be small enough to fit within or on a piece of jewelry. The speaker seems to marvel at this concept. She sees beauty in the fact that a world of “creatures,” as she describes them, could fit on a pendant, or on each of a ladies earrings.

217,"My mother in her feathers of flame
Grows taller. Every May Thirteenth
I see her with her sister Miriam. I lift
The torn-off diary page where my brother jotted
“Ma died today” – and there they are.


She is now as tall as Miriam.
In the perpetual Sunday Morning
Of everlasting, they are strolling together
Listening to the larks
Ringing in their orbits. The work of the cosmos,
Creation and destruction of matter
And of anti-matter
Pulses and flares, shudders and fades
Like the Northern Lights in their feathers.

My mother is telling Miriam
About her life, which was mine. Her voice comes, piping,
Down a deep gorge of woodland echoes:
“This is the water-line, dark on my dress, look,
Where I dragged him from the reservoir.
And that is the horse on which I galloped
Through the brick wall
And out over the heather simply
To bring him a new pen. This is the pen
I laid on the altar. And these
Are the mass marriages of him and his brother
Where I was not once a guest.” Then suddenly
She is scattering the red coals with her fingers
To find where I had fallen
For the third time. She laughs
Helplessly till she weeps. Miriam
Who died at eighteen
Is Madonna-like with pure wonder
To hear of all she missed. Now my mother
Shows her the rosary prayers of unending worry,
Like pairs of shoes, or one dress after another
“This is the sort of thing”, she is saying,
“I liked to wear best.” And: “Much of it,
You know, was simply sitting at the window
Watching the horizon. Truly
Wonderful it was, day after day,
Knowing they were somewhere. It still is.
Look.”

And they pause, on the brink
Of the starry dew. They are looking at me.
My mother, darker with her life,
Her Red Indian hair, her skin
So strangely olive and other-worldly,
Miriam now sheer flame beside her.
Their feathers throb softly, iridescent.
My mother’s face is glistening
As if she held it into the skyline wind
Looking towards me. I do this for her.

She is using me to tune finer
Her weeping love for my brother, through mine,
As if I were the shadow cast by this approach.

As when I came a mile over fields and walls
Towards her, and found her weeping for him –
Able for all that distance to think me him.",My mother in her feathers of flame                Grows taller. Every May Thirteenth I see her with her sister Miriam. I lift the torn-off diary page where my brother jotted ‘Ma died today’ – and there they are. I do this for her. She is using me to tune finer her weeping love for my brother.,"'Anniversary' by Ted Hughes commemorates the poet's dead mother and her sister, Miriam, on her death anniversary. 'Anniversary' by Ted Hughes is a commemorative poem that glorifies the spirit of the poet's mother. Her soul has an angelic outlook in the poet's imagination. The poet revisits the thoughts of his mother after seeing the torn diary page marked 13 May. On it, his brother had written, “Ma died today”. But, for the poet, she is still alive, in his poetic imagination, brimming with heavenly light. There is an out-worldly feature in her voice and her complexion. Hughes can hear what his mother tells his sister who is also dead. Their conversation forms the basis of the poem and in the end, the poet imaginatively goes nearer to the weeping spirit of his mother. Sadly, she doesn't weep for him. As a jealous sibling, the poet thinks she cries only for his brother. And, she loves the poet through the thoughts of his brother."
218,"I will to the King,
And offer him consolation in his trouble,
For that man there has set his teeth to die,
And being one that hates obedience,
Discipline, and orderliness of life,
I cannot mourn him.
W.B. YEATS
I. THE PROLOGUE
Patting good-bye, doubtless they told the lad
He’d always show the Hun a brave man’s face;
Father would sooner him dead than in disgrace,—
Was proud to see him going, aye, and glad.
Perhaps his mother whimpered how she’d fret
Until he got a nice safe wound to nurse.
Sisters would wish girls too could shoot, charge, curse …
Brothers—would send his favourite cigarette.
Each week, month after month, they wrote the same,
Thinking him sheltered in some Y.M. Hut,
Because he said so, writing on his butt
Where once an hour a bullet missed its aim
And misses teased the hunger of his brain.
His eyes grew old with wincing, and his hand
Reckless with ague. Courage leaked, as sand
From the best sand-bags after years of rain.
But never leave, wound, fever, trench-foot, shock,
Untrapped the wretch. And death seemed still withheld
For torture of lying machinally shelled,
At the pleasure of this world’s Powers who’d run amok.
He’d seen men shoot their hands, on night patrol.
Their people never knew. Yet they were vile.
‘Death sooner than dishonour, that’s the style!’
So Father said.
II. THE ACTION
One dawn, our wire patrol
Carried him. This time, Death had not missed.
We could do nothing but wipe his bleeding cough.
Could it be accident? - Rifles go off…
Not sniped? No. (Later they found the English ball.)
III. THE POEM
It was the reasoned crisis of his soul
Against more days of inescapable thrall,
Against infrangibly wired and blind trench wall
Curtained with fire, roofed in with creeping fire,
Slow grazing fire, that would not burn him whole
But kept him for death’s promises and scoff,
And life’s half-promising, and both their riling.
IV. THE EPILOGUE
With him they buried the muzzle his teeth had kissed,
And truthfully wrote the Mother, ‘Tim died smiling’.","I will to the King,                And offer him consolation in his trouble,                For that man there has set his teeth to die,                I cannot mourn him.W.B.

Soldiers who had grown too traumatized by war, or in general wanted to be back home with their loved ones, took to hoping for what were known as 'blighty wounds' – injuries that would send them back home to England without a hope of convalescing. The more desperate of the soldiers took to shooting off their own fingers, in the hopes that they would be sent home and never called up to active duty again; however, the British Army soon caught wind of this scheme, and soldiers who were thought to have SIWs were treated like garbage. Overall, approximately 4000 soldiers were found guilty of SIWs and sentenced to long prison stays. Discover more Wilfred Owen poems."

220,"Haze. Three student violists boarding
a bus. A clatter of jackhammers.
Granular light. A film of sweat for primer
and the heat for a coat of paint.
A man and a woman on a bench:
she tells him he must be psychic,
for how else could he sense, even before she knew,
that she’d need to call it off? A bicyclist
fumes by with a coach’s whistle clamped
hard between his teeth, shrilling like a teakettle
on the boil. I never meant, she says.
But I thought, he replies. Two cabs almost
collide; someone yells fuck in Farsi.
I’m sorry, she says. The comforts
of loneliness fall in like a bad platoon.
The sky blurs—there’s a storm coming
up or down. A lank cat slinks liquidly
around a corner. How familiar
it feels to feel strange, hollower
than a bassoon. A rill of chill air
in the leaves. A car alarm. Hail.","Haze. Three student violists boarding a bus. A clatter of jackhammers. How familiar it feels to feel strange, hollower than a bassoon. A lank cat slinks liquidly around a corner. Two cabs almostcollide; someone yells fuck in Farsi.","'Morningside Heights, July' by William Matthews explores life within a city. Matthews begins with the weather, looking at the 'Haze' of the location. He moves through a group of 'student violinists', the sound of 'jackhammers', the quality of 'Granular light' that he sees. Each of the images in the poem follows a different sense, Matthews providing an in-depth depiction of the city. Stories begin to emerge from these images, a woman who 'call[s] it off' with 'a man', two cab drivers arguing in Farsi. The final few images focus on blending city and nature, the 'chill air', and 'Hail' sandwiching the city sound of 'A car alarm'. The poem provides a summer view of a city, everything inside following each other in an eternal hum."

The poem begins with the speaker hoping to cheer up his own, and the reader's mood, by speaking of the new world, alongside God, that Keats is now residing in. He is beyond the problems and discomforts of the world. His death was incredibly important to the speaker, he holds a saint-like stature in the speaker's mind. He continues on to say that, while viewing the spot in which Keats is buried, there are no huge trees to block out the sun, only violets that wrap around “his bones,” or more likely, tombstone. Keats is compared to Saint Sebastian, an early Christian who was martyred for his faith. Keats is often thought of as having contracted tuberculosis due to grief. In the final sestet of the poem, the speaker describes Keats as being the finest English “poet-painter” since the Greek poets of old. He made a monumental impact on the speaker's life and on his readers. He concludes by quoting the inscription on the tombstone and saying that he will do whatever it takes to keep that land green, even if he has to water it with his own tears."
222,"AN OLD STORY.

I.

It was roses, roses, all the way,
With myrtle mixed in my path like mad:
The house-roofs seemed to heave and sway,
The church-spires flamed, such flags they had,
A year ago on this very day.

II.

The air broke into a mist with bells,
The old walls rocked with the crowd and cries.
Had I said, ``Good folk, mere noise repels---
But give me your sun from yonder skies!''
They had answered, ``And afterward, what else?''

III.

Alack, it was I who leaped at the sun
To give it my loving friends to keep!
Nought man could do, have I left undone:
And you see my harvest, what I reap
This very day, now a year is run.

IV.

There's nobody on the house-tops now---
Just a palsied few at the windows set;
For the best of the sight is, all allow,
At the Shambles' Gate---or, better yet,
By the very scaffold's foot, I trow.

V.

I go in the rain, and, more than needs,
A rope cuts both my wrists behind;
And I think, by the feel, my forehead bleeds,
For they fling, whoever has a mind,
Stones at me for my year's misdeeds.

VI.

Thus I entered, and thus I go!
In triumphs, people have dropped down dead.
``Paid by the world, what dost thou owe
``Me?''---God might question; now instead,
'Tis God shall repay: I am safer so.","A year ago on this very day. I leaped at the sun to give it my loving friends to keep.

Laughed the girl on the poster,
Kneeling up on the sand 
In tautened white satin. 
Behind her, a hunk of coast, a
Hotel with palms
Seemed to expand from her thighs and 
Spread breast-lifting arms.

She was slapped up one day in March. 
A couple of weeks, and her face
Was snaggle-toothed and boss-eyed; 
Huge tits and a fissured crotch
Were scored well in, and the space 
Between her legs held scrawls
That set her fairly astride
A tuberous cock and balls

Someone had used a knife
Or something to stab right through 
The moustached lips of her smile.

The poem begins with the speaker describing a poster advertising “Prestatyn,” a resort town in Wales. When the poster had only been up for a couple of weeks, those living in the area took it upon themselves to change it. The woman’s body was drawn on, and the sexual innuendoes present in the ad were enhanced. There was more than one participant in the defacing of the ad, making the whole series of events a protest of sorts against the idea that a perfect, pure, “sunny” life is possible."

The poem starts with a stanza describing the landscape in which the speaker wants to be buried. He wants to be somewhere peaceful, away from the city and under the stars.

225,"BY day the skyscraper looms in the smoke and sun and
has a soul.
Prairie and valley, streets of the city, pour people into
it and they mingle among its twenty floors and are
poured out again back to the streets, prairies and
valleys.
It is the men and women, boys and girls so poured in and
out all day that give the building a soul of dreams
and thoughts and memories.
(Dumped in the sea or fixed in a desert, who would care
for the building or speak its name or ask a policeman
the way to it?)
Elevators slide on their cables and tubes catch letters and
parcels and iron pipes carry gas and water in and
sewage out.
Wires climb with secrets, carry light and carry words,
and tell terrors and profits and loves--curses of men
grappling plans of business and questions of women
in plots of love.
Hour by hour the caissons reach down to the rock of the
earth and hold the building to a turning planet.
Hour by hour the girders play as ribs and reach out and
hold together the stone walls and floors.
Hour by hour the hand of the mason and the stuff of the
mortar clinch the pieces and parts to the shape an
architect voted.
Hour by hour the sun and the rain, the air and the rust,
and the press of time running into centuries, play
on the building inside and out and use it.
Men who sunk the pilings and mixed the mortar are laid
in graves where the wind whistles a wild song
without words
And so are men who strung the wires and fixed the pipes
and tubes and those who saw it rise floor by floor.
Souls of them all are here, even the hod carrier begging
at back doors hundreds of miles away and the brick-
layer who went to state's prison for shooting another
man while drunk.
(One man fell from a girder and broke his neck at the
end of a straight plunge--he is here--his soul has
gone into the stones of the building.)
On the office doors from tier to tier--hundreds of names
and each name standing for a face written across
with a dead child, a passionate lover, a driving
ambition for a million dollar business or a lobster's
ease of life.
Behind the signs on the doors they work and the walls
tell nothing from room to room.
Ten-dollar-a-week stenographers take letters from
corporation officers, lawyers, efficiency engineers,
and tons of letters go bundled from the building to all
ends of the earth.
Smiles and tears of each office girl go into the soul of
the building just the same as the master-men who
rule the building.
Hands of clocks turn to noon hours and each floor
empties its men and women who go away and eat
and come back to work.
Toward the end of the afternoon all work slackens and
all jobs go slower as the people feel day closing on
them.
One by one the floors are emptied. . . The uniformed
elevator men are gone. Pails clang. . . Scrubbers
work, talking in foreign tongues. Broom and water
and mop clean from the floors human dust and spit,
and machine grime of the day.
Spelled in electric fire on the roof are words telling
miles of houses and people where to buy a thing for
money. The sign speaks till midnight.
Darkness on the hallways. Voices echo. Silence
holds. . . Watchmen walk slow from floor to floor
and try the doors. Revolvers bulge from their hip
pockets. . . Steel safes stand in corners. Money
is stacked in them.
A young watchman leans at a window and sees the lights
of barges butting their way across a harbor, nets of
red and white lanterns in a railroad yard, and a span
of glooms splashed with lines of white and blurs of
crosses and clusters over the sleeping city.

In this piece, the beauty of the Chicago city is described through the eyes of the skyscraper. Due to its magnificence, it attracts a number of people from distant places. Sandburg praises the role every section played in building this remarkable building. He includes every small worker who laid their hands and sweat in the construction of the skyscraper. Through this poem, Sandburg shows how vital the role of an individual is and how they can make a noticeable mark in the modern world. He also talks about the pain one underwent while making the building and how they are left unrecognized. Sandburg personifies the building and begins by saying that the building “has a soul.” He glorifies a day within the walls of the skyscraper and praises those who worked day and night to keep the skyscraper standing straight and firm. He indirectly indicates to society and hints at the vital role played by an individual in building the nation. Just like the building is left without soul as the day ends, so is the nation without people. Thus, people are the soul of a nation. Overall, in this poem, he meditates on the mortality of humans and the enduring nature of man-made buildings."
226,"One foot down, then hop! It's hot.
Good things for the ones that's got.

They think I lost. I think I won.","One foot down, then hop! It's hot. Good things for the ones that's got. The game is done. They think I lost. I think I won. That's what hopping's all about. It's time to go home. You're done.","'Harlem Hopscotch' by Maya Angelou is a memorable poem that uses an extended metaphor to speak about the Black experience. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins by describing what playing hopscotch is like. The pavement is hot, and so, you have to jump into the air, trying not to put both feet on the ground. She makes several allusions to the nature of the world by suggesting that good things come to those who can afford them and that “Everybody” has to be for “hisself.” The speaker makes it clear that this is more than a game of hopscotch. She's also using it to define the Black experience. Since the players are Black, they have to keep moving. Soon they'll be out of food and need to pay rent. Jobs are hard to come by, and everyone, like the hopscotch players, are contorting themselves to try to make ends meet. If you land with both feet on the ground, the game is over. The speaker concludes by saying that some believe this means she's lost the game, but she thinks it means she's won."
227,"When Earth's last picture is painted and the tubes are twisted and dried,
When the oldest colours have faded, and the youngest critic has died,
We shall rest, and, faith, we shall need it -- lie down for an aeon or two,
Till the Master of All Good Workmen shall put us to work anew.

And those that were good shall be happy; they shall sit in a golden chair;
They shall splash at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comets' hair.
They shall find real saints to draw from -- Magdalene, Peter, and Paul;
They shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at all!

And only The Master shall praise us, and only The Master shall blame;
And no one shall work for money, and no one shall work for fame,
But each for the joy of the working, and each, in his separate star,
Shall draw the Thing as he sees It for the God of Things as They are!","When Earth's last picture is painted and the tubes are twisted and dried,                We shall rest, and, faith, we shall need it -- lie down for an aeon or two.                Till the Master of All Good Workmen shall put us to work anew.                And those that were good shall be happy; they shall sit in a golden chair;They shall splash at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comets' hair.","In 'When Earth's Last Picture Is Painted,' Rudyard Kipling compares the new world to a painting and describes how the “last picture” will be drawn in the last days on earth. In this poem, Kipling paints a dystopian image of a world where the colors of the “old” have faded, and the “youngest critic” of art has died. The speaker says that after the end of the world, people would rest in their graves for an æon or more until there is a new beginning. Those who were good during their lifetime will be rewarded and given a seat in the “golden chair.” They will be the first painters to draw on a “ten-league canvas” provided by God. Their painting would take inspiration from saints. In the process of completing the picture, they will never grow tired. In the last stanza, Kipling refers back to how only God's praise and approval matter to these people most, not “money” or “fame.”"

In the first part of the poem, the poet begins by telling his lover to take a picture he's given her and use to remember him by while he's gone on a trip. He knows that the trip is going to be long and that when he comes back, he's going to look and feel different. He tells her that he can use the picture to show those who question her about their relationship what he looked like when they fell in love. He believes he'll no longer be the attractive young man she once knew. Their relationship is going to hinge on their internal, emotional connection. This will take them into the next stage of their life, and their relationship will be far stronger and more dependable than a simple attraction to what the other person looks like."
229,"Where art thou Muse that thou forget’st so long,
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?
Spend’st thou thy fury on some worthless song,
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?

In gentle numbers time so idly spent;
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
And gives thy pen both skill and argument.

If any, be a satire to decay,
And make time’s spoils despised every where.
Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,
So thou prevent’st his scythe and crooked knife.","Where art thou Muse that thou forget’st so long, to speak of that which gives thee all thy might?Spend’s thou thy fury on some worthless song, darkening thy power to lend base subjects light. Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem, in gentle numbers time so idly spent.","'Sonnet 100 ' by William Shakespeare marks a turn in Shakespeare's Fair Youth series in which he implores his muse to inspire him. Throughout this poem, the speaker addresses his muse and chastises them for leaving him. He feels as though he's been abandoned by his ability to write sufficiently about his beloved, the Fair Youth. The speaker asks the muse to come back to him and allow him to write as he once did. He still hopes to immortalize this young man so that time's knife never touches him."

There's been a Revival.,"Synopsis of the Great Welsh Novel' by Harri Webb describes through humorous verse the state of Welsh society and culture. The poem begins with the speaker stating that there is a man who lives somewhere which may nor may not be flooded, named Dai K. This person and his relatives, are simply described. There is not much detail put into any character mentioned in this short narrative. The next section speaks on how all the women in the town are pregnant and all the residents have been subject to a religious revival. Eventually, a strange and famous man comes to visit the town, throwing off the already out of balance landscape. In the final section, the speaker describes how most people, especially the young, have left Wales. All who remain are like Ianto who reads to confused sheep and then jumps to his death."

The first contains a young student's plea for her teacher to stop one of their fellow students from copying their work. Rather than provide a solution, the teacher dismisses the issue and tries to get the student to solve it themselves. Throughout, the poet uses amusing and outrageous language that is meant to entertain, especially in the teacher's rather outlandish suggestions. The third part of the poem progresses in the same way, with the final issue being raised in the fifth stanza and amusingly dismissed in the sixth."

In the first lines of 'Sonnet 111,' the speaker begins by addressing Fortune. He is chastising Fortune for not providing him with the life he wanted. He is forced to cater to the public's whims. His success is based on their interest in him. The speaker feels that this has degraded him somehow, and he compares himself to a dyer who gets their own dye on their hands. This sullies him, and he's attempting to cure himself of it. The speaker is willing to take whatever medicine he needs to, no matter how bitter. But, he concludes, the Fair Youth's affections are the best possible medicine he could conceive of."
233,"I hear an army charging upon the land, And the thunder of horses plunging, foam about their knees: Arrogant, in black armour, behind them stand, Disdaining the reins, with fluttering whips, the charioteers. They cry unto the night their battle-name: I moan in sleep when I hear afar their whirling laughter. They cleave the gloom of dreams, a blinding flame, Clanging, clanging upon the heart as upon an anvil. They come shaking in triumph their long, green hair: They come out of the sea and run shouting by the shore. My heart, have you no wisdom thus to despair? My love, my love, my love, why have you left me alone?","I hear an army charging upon the land, And the thunder of horses plunging, foam about their knees: Arrogant, in black armour, behind them stand, with fluttering whips, the charioteers.

They cleave the gloom of dreams, a blinding flame, Clanging, clanging upon the heart as upon an anvil.","‘I Hear An Army’ captures the feeling of lost love through intense imagery and the use of musical patterns. In the poem, there is a description of a group of charioteers, riding out of the sea and approaching the lyrical voice that culminates with the thought of yearned affection."
234,"The little river twittering in the twilight,
The wan, wondering look of the pale sky,
This is almost bliss.
And everything shut up and gone to sleep,
All the troubles and anxieties and pain
Gone under the twilight.
Only the twilight now, and the soft “Sh!” of the river
That will last forever.
And at last I know my love for you is here,
I can see it all, it is whole like the twilight,
It is large, so large, I could not see it before

Lawrence is a love poem in which the speaker considers the irritations and restrictions of the real world. The poet's speaker addresses the beautiful scene he's experiencing in the first lines of 'Bei Hennef.' He describes the twilight, the river, and how far away he feels from his every day worries. This is something that allows him to think clearly in a way he can't when he's going about his mundane routine. Now, he can look around him and at his love and know how pure and full it is. He loves the intended listener of this poem, “you,” fully and completely. He knows now that the two complete one another. Despite this, he concludes, they still suffer from the annoyances of reality, and their love isn't as strong as it could be on a day to day basis."

In the first lines of this poem, the speaker begins by listing out a few compound words that describe a natural, wooded landscape. It is unclear where the speaker is, who they are, or how exactly they feel about their surroundings. But, their focus on imagery suggests that they care about nature and respect the rural lifestyle, which becomes clearer as the poem progresses. In the next lines, the speaker introduces more human-related imagery. This includes examples of farm equipment, structures one might find on a farm, and other objects one could encounter there. The poem concludes with a few compound words that suggest the end of the day or the end of life."

They peered from their windows and tried to look at the happenings outside. By drawing the shades, they watched through the charred glass. A group of men dressed in white costumes gathered around a cross trussed like a Christmas tree. They put it on fire and left the place. Those who were inside their houses (including the speaker and her family) watched the fiery show throughout the night, in the trembling light of a hurricane lamp."
237,"In May, when sea-winds pierced our solitudes,

I found the fresh Rhodora in the woods,

Spreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook,

To please the desert and the sluggish brook.

The purple petals fallen in the pool

Made the black water with their beauty gay;

Here might the red-bird come his plumes to cool,

And court the flower that cheapens his array.

This charm is wasted on the earth and sky,

Then beauty is its own excuse for Being;

Why thou wert there, O rival of the rose!

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he was once walking through the woods on a windy day in May. The weather was not great, and the woods through which he traveled were bleak. That is until came upon the “fresh Rhodora,” or rhododendron. The brightness of the petals this flower illuminated everything around it. The dark water was made gay and the birds put to shame for their lack of brilliance. In the second half, the speaker describes the power of simple beauty. As well as how the flower exists for no other reason than to be beautiful. One has eyes to gaze upon such things, but they do not grow for humankind."

And sinks into my throat her tiger’s tooth,
Stealing my breath of life, I will confess

Beginning with what is bad about the country, McKay quickly says that he loves it.

The poem is at once a critique and a love letter to the United States of America."

The majority of this piece is made up o statements about the state of the environment followed by three lines about the speaker's own experience. Winter is approaching throughout this piece. It never arrives, but is seen to kill the leaves, flowers, and dull down the colors of the world. While to many this would be a depressing sight, alongside the deaths of friends and the loss of love, the speaker is not changed by it. He is so deep into his own mental depression there is nothing that can pull him out of it. It gives him a backward kind of strength as well as there is no further down he can sink. He is at the bottom of every possible emotion. The poem concludes with his description of the “unhope” he is waiting in. There is no end in sight to his predicament, he is trapped.

'Night Sweat' by Robert Lowell is an emotionally complex poem. It's not clear why the speaker is suffering from night sweats. The metaphorical meaning of “my stalled equipment” makes it clear that the speaker is going through writer's block. The downward glide of his ability and his previous bias are blocking him to pen down that “one writing”. However, in the next section of the poem, the poet says his wife's presence lightens his mind. She has such a personality that even makes the plain things of his room cheerful. At last, he requests his dear wife to redeem him from his anguish and frustration as she has done before."
243,"A woman waits for me, she contains all, nothing is lacking,
Yet all were lacking if sex were lacking, or if the moisture of the right man were lacking.

Sex contains all, bodies, souls,
Meanings, proofs, purities, delicacies, results, promulgations,
Songs, commands, health, pride, the maternal mystery, the seminal milk,
All hopes, benefactions, bestowals, all the passions, loves, beauties, delights of the earth,
All the governments, judges, gods, follow'd persons of the earth,
These are contain'd in sex as parts of itself and justifications of itself.

Without shame the man I like knows and avows the deliciousness of his sex,
Without shame the woman I like knows and avows hers.

Now I will dismiss myself from impassive women,
I will go stay with her who waits for me, and with those women that are warm-blooded and sufficient for me,
I see that they understand me and do not deny me,
I see that they are worthy of me, I will be the robust husband of those women.

They are not one jot less than I am,
They are tann'd in the face by shining suns and blowing winds,
Their flesh has the old divine suppleness and strength,
They know how to swim, row, ride, wrestle, shoot, run, strike, retreat, advance, resist, defend themselves,
They are ultimate in their own right—they are calm, clear, well-possess'd of themselves.

I draw you close to me, you women,
I cannot let you go, I would do you good,
I am for you, and you are for me, not only for our own sake, but for others' sakes,
Envelop'd in you sleep greater heroes and bards,
They refuse to awake at the touch of any man but me.

It is I, you women, I make my way,
I am stern, acrid, large, undissuadable, but I love you,
I do not hurt you any more than is necessary for you,
I pour the stuff to start sons and daughters fit for these States, I press with slow rude muscle,
I brace myself effectually, I listen to no entreaties,
I dare not withdraw till I deposit what has so long accumulated within me.

Through you I drain the pent-up rivers of myself,
In you I wrap a thousand onward years,
On you I graft the grafts of the best-beloved of me and America,
The drops I distil upon you shall grow fierce and athletic girls, new artists, musicians, and singers,
The babes I beget upon you are to beget babes in their turn,
I shall demand perfect men and women out of my love-spendings,
I shall expect them to interpenetrate with others, as I and you interpenetrate now,
I shall count on the fruits of the gushing showers of them, as I count on the fruits of the gushing showers I give now,
I shall look for loving crops from the birth, life, death, immortality, I plant so lovingly now.","A woman waits for me, she contains all, nothing is lacking, yet all were lacking if sex were lacking, or if the moisture of the right man were lacking. Without shame the man I like knows and avows the deliciousness of his sex, without shame the woman I like understands me and does not deny me. I will be the robust husband of those women.","'A Woman Waits for Me' by Walt Whitman describes how to forge the ideal relationship out of which the perfect offspring is born. This Whitman poem is not merely about the act of procreation itself. Rather it is about the act of creation, particularly the way a perfect child is born, nurtured, and guided. The poem begins with a speaker describing how a perfect woman without lacking anything waits for him. Then he goes on to describe the act of sex and how it is all-inclusive. He particularly waits for the women who are passionate, “warm-blooded,” and “sufficient” for him. They are the ones who could bear the children of the future and nurture the qualities of the speaker within them. His creative energy is what he intends to plant in the hearts of the women who wait for none other than him."
244,"All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lin’d,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well sav’d, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.","All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players;                They have their exits and their entrances;                And one man in his time plays many parts,                His acts being seven ages.

The speaker, Jacques, begins “All the world's a stage” by asserting that life is like a stage on which “men and women merely” play roles. They play different parts throughout their lives, as the speaker is now. In the bulk of this monologue, the speaker spends time going through the seven ages of man. One starts in infancy, moves through childhood, and into the best part of their life when they're a lover, soldier, and judge. Later, they lose control of their senses and eventually can't take care of themselves.

When a poem is able to make the natural world a character to root for or to dislike, it opens up countless dimensions of poetic intrigue that is unparalleled by most art. Stevie Smith’s ‘The River God’ gives away its main concept directly in the title — as a river cannot be a divine entity of any sort, the reader can expect the personification of the river into a godlike entity. For a poem to be able to create that analogy gives it a unique form and power, and Smith’s use of poetic devices to form her river character is done extremely well, for the creation of a poem just as powerful as its namesake."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that Africa is a woman who has deserts for hair and “mountains” for breasts. She is truly beautiful and incredibly strong. The next lines become darker. Brigands arrive on the shores of the continent and take everything in sight. The women are raped and the men sold into the slave trade. Culture is destroyed and Africa is metaphorically on the ground. In the final stanza the woman, embodying the continent, stands up. She screams out everything that has occurred and refuses to be put down for a moment longer. Africa strides out from her past of death into a new, stronger future."

And then they clearly flew instead of fell. They were flying in a gradient invisible, from silver to random, white, and slow.",'Because You Asked about the Line Between Prose and Poetry' by Howard Nemerov is a thoughtful depiction of the differences alluded to in the title. The poem uses a snowy and rainy scene and the images of birds feeding to define the difference between “prose and poetry.” It is not a clear or obvious difference but one that requires some analysis to understand. This is part of the poet's way of suggesting how poems are different from prose work. They require more interpretation and may leave the reader without a clear understanding of what every image means.

In the first lines of 'Wine Tasting,' the speaker describes what memories come to mind while drinking wine. They are connected to the smell and taste of cracked leather and cherries. She moves on, bringing in the thoughts and experiences of Li Bai, a friend, and then again her own. The poem concludes with the speaker suggesting that the temporary nature of this kind of experience makes it all the more moving."

In the first stanza of this poem, the speaker begins by describing how when they were young, they would've died for the truth. They wanted to fight and rid the world of injustice, fools, and selfish people. But they're older now and have realized that pure passion and anger will not change the world. They've had to accept that the world is how it is."
250,"There will be rose and rhododendron
When you are dead and under ground;
Still will be heard from white syringas
Heavy with bees, a sunny sound;
Still will the tamaracks be raining

There will be robins in the stubble, and brown sheep upon the warm green hill.","'Elegy Before Death' is about the physical and spiritual impact of a loss and how it can and cannot change one's world. This poem is told from the perspective of a second person narrator directing their statements at an undefined “you.” The poem begins by describing how the world will be the same after this person has passed on. There will still be “rose and rhododendron” (1) and the “sunny sound” (4) of bees will still “be heard from white syringas” (3). Additional creatures and plants will go on as they always have, as will the seasons. Time will not stop for the world. The only physical things that will be disturbed are the simple weeds on the gravesite and the land that this person's spirit will walk after death. The poem concludes by calling this passing a “great” one (21) and making clear that while the world is not physically changed, it will be essentially changed for the speaker. The spark of beauty and magic in “common water” (23) and “simple stone” (24) will leave along with “you”."

The current date when Jordan writes, 1974 is 16 years after the birth of her son in 1958. The first stanza is designated to these facts and statistics, those which comprise the newborn's life. The poem then moves into Jordan's preparedness for motherhood, with the poem becoming more abstract. The final two stanzas of the poem discuss the child as he grows, becoming his own distinct personality. The final word of the poem focuses on 'light', with motherhood being some Jordan prides herself on."

The poem begins with the speaker telling the reader, and the person with whom they are in love, that no one, not even “Beauty's daughters” can compare to this person's beauty. They are never definitively described as man or woman, but, they are clearly seen as god-like, unbelievably powerful, and influential in the speaker's life. Byron spends the bulk of this short, lyrical and clearly musical sixteen line poem using natural images such as the “midnight moon” and the deepest parts of the ocean to convey the speaker's love."

gathering dust.

wintry gusts.

For Johnson, a happy relationship is like a 'musical' or 'hymn', the music is harmonious and great. Yet, just like music, relationships can be forgotten and fade over time. Johnson uses this idea of 'forgotten music' to discuss past relationships, their passion never fading, only being thought of less and less."
254,"From Wynyard's Gap the livelong day,
The livelong day,
We beat afoot the northward way
We had travelled times before.
The sun-blaze burning on our backs,
Our shoulders sticking to our packs,
By fosseway1, fields, and turnpike tracks
We skirted sad Sedge-Moor.

Full twenty miles we jaunted on,
We jaunted on, —
My fancy-man2, and jeering John,
And Mother Lee, and I.
And, as the sun drew down to west,
We climbed the toilsome Polden crest,
And saw, of landskip3 sights the best,
The inn that beamed thereby.

Ay, side by side
Through the Great Forest, Blackmoor4 wide,
And where the Parret ran.
We'd faced the gusts on Mendip ridge,
Had crossed the Yeo unhelped by bridge,
Been stung by every Marshwood midge5,
I and my fancy-man.

Lone inns we loved, my man and I,
My man and I;
'King's Stag', 'Windwhistle' high and dry,
'The Horse' on Hintock Green,
The cosy house at Wynyard's Gap,
'The Hut', renowned on Bredy Knap,
And many another wayside tap
Where folk might sit unseen.

O deadly day,
O deadly day! —
I teased my fancy man in play
And wanton idleness.
I walked alongside jeering John,
I laid his hand my waist upon;
I would not bend my glances on
My lover's dark distress.

Thus Poldon top at last we won,
At last we won,
And gained the inn at sink of sun
Far-famed as 'Marshal's Elm'.
Beneath us figured tor and lea,6
From Mendip to the western sea —
I doubt if any finer sight there be
Within this royal realm.

Inside the settle7 all a-row —
All four a-row
We sat, I next to John, to show
That he had wooed and won.
And then he took me on his knee,
And swore it was his turn to be
My favoured mate, and Mother Lee
Passed to my former one.

Then in a voice I had never heard,
I had never heard,
My only love to me: 'One word,
My lady, if you please!
Whose is the child you are like8 to bear? —
His? After all my months o' care?'
Gods knows 'twas not! But, O despair!
I nodded — still to tease.

Then he sprung, and with his knife —
And with his knife,
He let out jeering Johnny's life,
Yes; there at set of sun.
The slant ray through the window nigh
Gilded John's blood and glazing eye,
Ere scarcely Mother Lee and I
Knew that the deed was done.

The taverns tell the gloomy tale,
The gloomy tale,
How that at Ivel-Chester jail
My love, my sweetheart swung;
Though stained till now by no misdeed
Save one horse ta'en in time of need;
(Blue Jimmy stole right many a steed
Ere his last fling he flung.)

Thereaft I walked the world alone
Alone, alone!
On his death-day I gave my groan
And dropt his dead-born child.
'Twas nigh the jail, beneath a tree,
None tending me; for Mother Lee
Had died at Glaston,9 leaving me
Unfriended on the wild.

And in the night as I lay weak,
As I lay weak,
The leaves a-falling on my cheek,
The red moon low declined —
The ghost of him I'd die to kiss
Rose up and said: 'Ah, tell me this!
Was the child mine, or was it his?
Speak, that I my rest may find!'

O doubt but I told him then,
I told him then,
That I had kept me from all men
Since we joined lips and swore.
Whereat he smiled, and thinned away
As the wind stirred to call up day . . .

The poem begins with the speaker describing a journey across England. She and three companions were walking through forests, over hills, and thoroughly enjoying the trip. It was a long and hard one, but they had one another. The most important relationship within the group is that between the speaker, the trampwoman, and her lover. These two had been together for a long time and the speaker decided to tease her lover. She did so by pretending that another traveler, Jeering John, had won her over. This progressed until her lover became enraged, demanded to know if she was carrying his child, and murdered Jeering John. His act of violence, and the speaker's acts of thoughtlessness, led to his death by hanging. The speaker miscarried her child and was left alone to wander the landscape. The only moment of peace comes when the ghost of the lover comes to her and finally receives the correct answer to his question. Yes, the baby was his. This allows him to depart to the next life."

Stem end and blossom end,

Went surely to the cider-apple heap
As of no worth.

The speaker tells that his long ladder still stands ‘sticking through a tree’, rising high toward heaven. He seems to have left it there on purpose to do some more apple-picking later."

And many a burdened licorice bush
Was blooming round our feet;
Red hair she had and golden skin,
Her sulky lips were shaped for sin,

The strongest legs in Pontefract.

The light and dangling licorice flowers
Gave off the sweetest smells;
From various black Victorian towers
The Sunday evening bells
Came pealing over dales and hills
And tanneries and silent mills
And lowly streets where country stops
And little shuttered corner shops.

And plucked a licorice leaf;

My red-haired robber chief.

It left me winded, wilting, weak,
And held in brown arms strong and bare
And wound with flaming ropes of hair.","In the licorice fields at Pontefract my love and I did meet. Red hair she had and golden skin, sulky lips were shaped for sin.

Throughout the lines of this piece, Montgomery's speaker describes a forest and the sights and sounds within it.

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins by describing how devoted he is to God and describing how he feels that God made him in his image. The speaker is dedicated to God, but he's lived a sinful life. This is something he's well aware of and which he's trying to atone for. But, he worries that he doesn't have enough time to escape Satan's grasp."
259,"Indeed indeed, I cannot tell,
Though I ponder on it well,
Which were easier to state,
All my love or all my hate.
Surely, surely, thou wilt trust me
When I say thou dost disgust me.
O, I hate thee with a hate
That would fain annihilate;
Yet sometimes against my will,
My dear friend, I love thee still.
It were treason to our love,
And a sin to God above,
One iota to abate
Of a pure impartial hate.","""I hate thee with a hate that would fain annihilate,"" he writes. ""Yet sometimes against my will, I love thee still"" ""It were treason to our love, and a sin to God above,"" he adds. ""One iota to abateOf a pure impartial hate""","In this poem, ‘Indeed, Indeed I cannot Tell,’ Henry David Thoreau manages to relate with almost every living human being. He communicates a feeling that is all too familiar for many people. He is confused about the feeling he is experiencing- so confused, in fact, that he doesn’t know whether it is love or hate. The feeling that Thoreau relates to this poem is one that most have felt when they have experienced the breaking off of a relationship. Thoreau expresses these feelings so articulately that readers can easily conclude the cause of this feeling."

The poem draws images of nature, showing how language and words can be controlled and placed in an organized manner. Riprap is often used as a foundation for a breakwater or other structures, which is why Snyder compares it to words, which form the foundation of human language, expressions, and eventually, of society."
261,"Stand still, and I will read to thee
A lecture, love, in love's philosophy.
These three hours that we have spent,
Walking here, two shadows went
Along with us, which we ourselves produc'd.
But, now the sun is just above our head,
We do those shadows tread,
And to brave clearness all things are reduc'd.
So whilst our infant loves did grow,
Disguises did, and shadows, flow
From us, and our cares; but now 'tis not so.
That love has not attain'd the high'st degree,
Which is still diligent lest others see.
Except our loves at this noon stay,
We shall new shadows make the other way.
As the first were made to blind
Others, these which come behind
Will work upon ourselves, and blind our eyes.
If our loves faint, and westwardly decline,
To me thou, falsely, thine,
And I to thee mine actions shall disguise.
The morning shadows wear away,
But these grow longer all the day;
But oh, love's day is short, if love decay.
Love is a growing, or full constant light,
And his first minute, after noon, is night.","Stand still, and I will read to thee a lecture, love, in love's philosophy. These three hours that we have spent,                Walking here, two shadows went along with us, which we ourselves produc'd. But, now the sun is just above our head,                We do those shadows tread,                And to brave clearness all things are reduced.","This poem is part of Songs and Sonnets, a collection of poems published two years after John Donne’s death. Songs and Sonnets includes 55 poems, which are not strictly “songs” or “sonnets”, that were not conceived as a compilation including ‘A Lecture upon the Shadow.’ They were written between 1590 and 1617 and later edited and grouped in different editions of Donne’s Poems. Consequently, the poems are all part of a love lyric but don’t always portray a single approach to love. Songs and Sonnets also includes poems like The Flea, The Good Morrow, and The Sun Rising, among others.

The poem narrates how a relationship that appeared to be blossoming has later deteriorated. Thus, love is one of the main themes of A Lecture upon the Shadow. John Donne is known for portraying intense emotions through conceits. A conceit is a metaphor that compares two dissimilar things in an unusual way. Particularly, in A Lecture upon the Shadow, the lyrical voice compares the different stages of a relationship to the course of a day and the movement of the sun.

A Lecture upon the Shadow follows the sonnet form loosely. The traditional sonnet is formed by an octave and a sestet with an ABBAABBA CDDCEE (or CDCDEE) rhyme scheme. The Shakespearean sonnet, which is contemporary to Donne’s poetry, is formed by three quatrains and a couplet in iambic pentameter with ABAB CDCD EFEF GG rhyme. A Lecture upon the Shadow has 26 lines in iambic pentameter with an AABBCDDCEEE rhyme scheme. The varying couplets and their rhyme resemble those of Shakespeare’s poetry. Moreover, the poem uses a great number of poetic devices such as alliteration, assonance, and extended metaphors."
262,"Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;
Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth
of sun-split clouds,—and done a hundred things
You have not dreamed of—wheeled and soared and swung
High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there,
I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung
My eager craft through footless halls of air ....

Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue
I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace
Where never lark nor ever eagle flew—
And, while with silent lifting mind I've trod
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.","Oh!

The bulk of 'High Flight' is spent depicting, through techniques such as alliteration, sibilance, and personification, the experience of flying. The speaker's descriptions are joyous and upliftings. He describes the sensations of being separated from the earth and in parts of the sky even birds don't enter into. The experience is all in all, a spiritual one that brings him closer to God."

With flowering grasses, and fields
Shadowing Domesday lines
Under wheat’s restless silence;
The differently-dressed servants
With tiny rooms in huge houses,
The dust behind limousines;

Leaving the gardens tidy,

Lasting a little while longer:

The narrative zooms out, taking the reader across the countryside and then to all of England. There are going to be so many changes in the coming years, the speaker says, everything is going to be different, and innocence is going to be lost."
264,"Swan in Falling Snow

Upon the darkish, thin, half-broken ice
There seemed to lie a barrel-sized, heart-shaped snowball,
Frozen hard, its white
identical with the untrodden white
of the lake shore. Closer, its somber face—
Mask and beak—came clear, the neck’s
Long cylinder, and the splayed feet, balanced,
Weary, immodbile. Black water traced, behind it,
An abandoned gesture. Soft in still air, snowflakes
Fell and fell. Silence
Deepened, deepened. The short day
Suspended itself, endless.",Swan in Falling Snow is a short story by American writer and poet Robert Frost. The story is set in a frozen lake and features a snow-capped Swan. The short story is about the Swan and his journey through the snow. The author also writes about his relationship with his wife.,"'Swan in Falling Snow' by Denise Levertov contains a description of a dead swan's body buried in the snow. Levertov's speaker talks about how he came across a swan's frozen body in the snow. The “barrel-sized” body of the creature easily captured his attention. He went near it to have a closer look. The scene made him feel sad for the creature. At the same time, it somehow aroused a sensation of awe in his heart. There was a resemblance between the frozen body and the untrodden snow near the shore. With close attention, he could notice its physical features clearly. In contrast to the stillness of the creature, nature went on at its own pace."
265,"I sat all morning in the college sick bay
Counting bells knelling classes to a close.
At two o'clock our neighbours drove me home.

In the porch I met my father crying—
He had always taken funerals in his stride—
And Big Jim Evans saying it was a hard blow.

The baby cooed and laughed and rocked the pram
When I came in, and I was embarrassed
By old men standing up to shake my hand

And tell me they were 'sorry for my trouble'.
Whispers informed strangers I was the eldest,
Away at school, as my mother held my hand

In hers and coughed out angry tearless sighs.
At ten o'clock the ambulance arrived
With the corpse, stanched and bandaged by the nurses.

Next morning I went up into the room. Snowdrops
And candles soothed the bedside; I saw him
For the first time in six weeks. Paler now,

Wearing a poppy bruise on his left temple,
He lay in the four-foot box as in his cot.
No gaudy scars, the bumper knocked him clear.

He had always taken funerals in his stride. Big Jim Evans said it was a hard blow.,"'Mid-Term Break' by Seamus Heaney describes the emotional turmoil experienced by a speaker who has lost a loved one in a traumatic way. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is being quarantined within a “sick bay” of his college. It is here he waited for his neighbours to come and pick him up and take him home. The boy has suffered a loss, one which does not become clear until the final line of the poem. He travels home and is met by his suffering family. His father is crying, and his mother is unable to even speak. There are many strangers around attempting to sympathize with the family, but their efforts appear awkward and are often unwanted. The body arrives via ambulance the next day and the boy takes a look at it when he is alone one morning. There are no great injuries that he can see but he knows this is due to the fact that this person was thrown by the bumper of a car. The final line states that the coffin will only be four feet long, the same length as the child's age, making clear to the reader that the speaker has lost his young brother in a terrible accident."

267,"For the first time, I listen to a lost
and secret recording of us
making love near-on ten years ago.

I recognize your voice, your sounds,
though if I knew no better,
I could be any man in any room.

After, the rising sounds of rising
and of dressing and once
as you step up close to the deck,

perhaps to pick up shoes, you sing
the chorus of Sunday Morning.
I call on you to hurry and we leave.

might have passed us walking away

While listening to the tape, he clearly values his lover and pays specific attention to any utterances that she makes. The things that he does or says carries little importance to him.

He draws attention to the slightest details including the sounds the cars made as the drove by on the way home."

The speaker, presumably Oliver, is talking directly to her reader, imploring them to not worry so much about being good; rather, the reader should be true to nature and the beauty found in it. Throughout the poem, Oliver uses the word “you” to speak to the reader, which lends an intimate, almost urgent air about the work. Throughout, she uses the image of a flock of wild geese. "
269,"Just as I was dashing to catch the Dublin- Cork train
Dashing up and down the stairs, searching my pockets,
She told me that her sister in Cork wanted a loan of the axe;
It was late June and
The buddleia tree in the backyard
Had grown out of control.
The taxi was ticking over outside in the street,
All the neighbours noticing it.
‘You mean that you want me to bring her down the axe?’
‘Yes, if you wouldn’t mind, that is –‘
‘A simple saw would do the job, surely to God
She could borrow a simple saw.’
‘She said she’d like the axe.’
‘OK.’ There is a Blue Cabs taxi ticking over outside
And the whole world inspecting it,
‘I’ll bring her down the axe.’
The axe – all four-and-a-half feet of it –
Was leaning up against the wall behind the settee –
The fold-up settee that doubles as a bed.
She handed the axe to me just as it was,
As neat as a newborn babe,
All in the bare buff.
You’d think she’d have swaddled it up
In something – if not a blanket, an old newspaper,
But no, not even a token hanky","Just as I was dashing to catch the Dublin- Cork train, she told me that her sister in Cork wanted a loan of the axe.

The poem takes the reader into the troubled marriage between a man and a woman. The man is about to leave for Cork when his wife asks him to carry an axe on the train with him. This tool should be delivered to her sister. He has no desire to take the axe with him and thinks the request is absurd, but he does give in.

270,"Chestnuts fell in the charred season,
Fell finally, finding room
In air to open their old cases
So they gleam out from the gold leaves,
In the dusk now, where they dropped down.

I go watch them, waiting for winter,
Their husks open and holding on.
Those rusted rims are rigid=hard
And cling clean to the clear brown,

And the fall sun sinks soon,
And the day draws to its dark end,
.and the feet give up the gray walk,
no longer lingering, light gone,

The chestnuts have gone hollow, their gleam gone, their grain gone, and the children are home. ""I am here and do not go home,"" the author writes.","'Another Reluctance' by Annie Finch is a thoughtful poem about an experience with chestnuts during a speaker's youth. The first lines describe the chestnuts falling and sitting among the golden leaves on a fall day. This is something the speaker has been waiting a long time for, but, as it turns out, it's still impossible to get to them. The “cases” won't open, and the speaker and other children find themselves disappointed. They try and stay and wait, and eventually, the speaker is the only one there when everyone else has gone home. They're reluctant to leave, holding out hope that something is going to change despite the fact that the fall is over and winter is setting in."

the fireworks as if no-one had ever
done this before, made shapes, signs

of nostalgia, as normally only attaches
to things long known and lost. Such an absence
such emptiness of sky the fireworks leave
after their festival. We, fumbling
for words of love, remember the rockets
the spinning wheels, the sudden diamonds
and say with delight “Yes, like that, like that”

Reading through the poem, you will come across images connected with fireworks, such as: “shapes”, “stars”, “diamonds”, and “rockets”. In addition, the poet also uses enjambment so that a quick pace and fast rhythm can be created in the poem. The poet makes use of this poetic device taking into account the theme of fireworks and its deeper meaning of euphoria and temporary excitement and. Moreover, the poet has cleverly used the word “falling” at the end of the fifth and second last lines, “of fire” and “stars”. The use of both these words in the poem indicates the physical act of falling. In fact, they are paradoxical, as fire and stars usually don't come down rather by nature they rise. Thus, all through the poem, you will poet making very clever use of language techniques to take ahead its theme."

The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand singing on the steamboat deck,

He is also known as the father of free verse poetry. He deemed himself above rigors of rhyme and meter since Whitman used free verses freely. However, his poetry is not a bunch of non-rhyming lines as 'I Hear America Singing' is a decent, tightly moderated poem. The poem is a listing of manual workers, their work content, and singing along the way. The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beamThe mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off workThe boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deck-hand singing on the steamboat deck As is the case, Walt Whitman's poems tend to get lengthy as they progress, whereas they are tightly managed in the beginning. This phenomenon is called anaphora as repetition keeps recurring. It is the polar opposite of traditional poetry norms where verses are controlled tightly in order to maintain the rhyming sequence. In the case of Walt Whitman, he aspired to seek freedom of self-exploration and discovery, rising above conventional forms like a true American."
273,"The first of the undecoded messages read: “Popeye sits in thunder, Unthought of. From that shoebox of an apartment,
From livid curtain’s hue, a tangram emerges: a country.”
Meanwhile the Sea Hag was relaxing on a green couch: “How pleasant To spend one’s vacation en la casa de Popeye,” she scratched
Her cleft chin’s solitary hair. She remembered spinach
And was going to ask Wimpy if he had bought any spinach. “M’love,” he intercepted, “the plains are decked out in thunder Today, and it shall be as you wish.” He scratched
The part of his head under his hat. The apartment
Seemed to grow smaller. “But what if no pleasant

Suddenly they remembered how it was cheaper in the country. Wimpy was thoughtfully cutting open a number 2 can of spinach When the door opened and Swee’pea crept in. “How pleasant!”
But Swee’pea looked morose. A note was pinned to his bib. “Thunder And tears are unavailing,” it read. “Henceforth shall Popeye’s apartment Be but remembered space, toxic or salubrious, whole or scratched.”
Olive came hurtling through the window; its geraniums scratched
Her long thigh. “I have news!” she gasped. “Popeye, forced as you know to flee the country

But Olive was already out of earshot. Now the apartment
Succumbed to a strange new hush. “Actually it’s quite pleasant

The poem is a strange one. It follows a few moments in the lives of recognizable characters from the Popeye cartoon included Olive, Sea Hag, Whimpy, and Swee'pea. The characters are staying in Popeye's apartment and go through emotional ups and downs. At one point, they feel like they're on a vacation, and in the next, they're irritated with the city and want to go to the country. When Olive comes into the poem and declares that Popeye has been exiled to the country and also describes his ability to control lightning, the poem gets more complex. In the end, after going back and forth in regards to how happy or unhappy they are, Popeye sends thunder into the apartment that's “domestic” and green like spinach."

We stopped, and, watching men with number plates
Sprint down the platform to familiar gates,

That this was still the town that had been 'mine'
So long, but found I wasn't even clear
Which side was which. From where those cycle-crates
Were standing, had we annually departed

For all those family hols? . . . A whistle went:
Things moved. I sat back, staring at my boots.
'Was that,' my friend smiled, 'where you ""have your roots""?'
No, only where my childhood was unspent,
I wanted to retort, just where I started:

By now I've got the whole place clearly charted.
Our garden, first: where I did not invent
Blinding theologies of flowers and fruits,
And wasn't spoken to by an old hat.
And here we have that splendid family

The boys all biceps and the girls all chest,
Their comic Ford, their farm where I could be
'Really myself'. I'll show you, come to that,
The bracken where I never trembling sat,

Determined to go through with it; where she
Lay back, and 'all became a burning mist'.
And, in those offices, my doggerel
Was not set up in blunt ten-point, nor read
By a distinguished cousin of the mayor,

Who didn't call and tell my father There
Before us, had we the gift to see ahead -
'You look as though you wished the place in Hell,'
My friend said, 'judging from your face.' 'Oh well,
I suppose it's not the place's fault,' I said.

'Nothing, like something, happens anywhere.","Coming up England by a different line, I came to Coventry by accident. I was born here, but I didn't know which side was which. I've got the whole place clearly charted. I'll show you, come to that, and I'll tell you how I got there.","I Remember, I Remember' by Philip Larkin contains the passing thoughts of a speaker as he sees his hometown of Coventry from a train. The poem begins with the speaker and his friend arriving, briefly, in Coventry. They are on their way somewhere else and are stopped at the platform. The speaker looks around, hoping to see something he recognizes, but doesn't. This fact does not surprise him as Coventry was never really a home to him. The rest of the poem is devoted to describing things that didn't happen to the speaker. He has in his mind an idealized version of what childhood should be. He also knows his childhood did not match up with his own experience. The speaker did not have close family friends, spend happy hours in the garden, or have his written work recognized by someone of marginal importance. These factors add up to an unhappy childhood that the speaker's friend questions him about. The poem concludes with the speaker saying it wasn't Coventry's fault he was unhappy as he would've been unhappy anywhere."
275,"Thou yellow trumpeter of laggard Spring!
Thou herald of rich Summer's myriad flowers!
The climbing sun with new recovered powers
Does warm thee into being, through the ring
Of rich, brown earth he woos thee, makes thee fling
Thy green shoots up, inheriting the dowers
Of bending sky and sudden, sweeping showers,
Till ripe and blossoming thou art a thing
To make all nature glad, thou art so gay;
To fill the lonely with a joy untold;
Nodding at every gust of wind to-day,
To-morrow jewelled with raindrops. Always bold
To stand erect, full in the dazzling play
Of April's sun, for thou hast caught his gold.","Thou yellow trumpeter of laggard Spring! The climbing sun with new recovered powers. The green shoots up, inheriting the dowers of bending sky and sudden, sweeping showers. To make all nature glad, thou art so gay; to fill the lonely with a joy untold.","'To an Early Daffodil' by Amy Lowell is a lovely poem in which the speaker talks to a daffodil and describes its best features. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker describes the transition from spring to summer through the sun's increased heat. This comes down to the earth and the soil and makes the daffodil bloom. This is encouraged further by some rainstorms. When the daffodil does bloom, it is gold like the sun and standing erect through the season. There's nothing that can diminish its beauty."
276,"You who are happy in a thousand homes,
Or overworked therein, to a dumb peace;
Whose souls are wholly centered in the life
Of that small group you personally love;
Who told you that you need not know or care
About the sin and sorrow of the world?

Do you believe the sorrow of the world
Does not concern you in your little homes? —
That you are licensed to avoid the care
And toil for human progress, human peace,
And the enlargement of our power of love
Until it covers every field of life?

The one first duty of all human life
Is to promote the progress of the world
In righteousness, in wisdom, truth and love;
And you ignore it, hidden in your homes,
Content to keep them in uncertain peace,
Content to leave all else without your care.

Yet you are mothers! And a mother's care
Is the first step toward friendly human life.
Life where all nations in untroubled peace
Unite to raise the standard of the world
And make the happiness we seek in homes
Spread everywhere in strong and fruitful love.

You are content to keep that mighty love
In its first steps forever; the crude care
Of animals for mate and young and homes,
Instead of pouring it abroad in life,
Its mighty current feeding all the world
Till every human child can grow in peace.

You cannot keep your small domestic peace
Your little pool of undeveloped love,
While the neglected, starved, unmothered world
Struggles and fights for lack of mother's care,
And its tempestuous, bitter, broken life
Beats in upon you in your selfish homes.

We all may have our homes in joy and peace
When woman's life, in its rich power of love
Is joined with man's to care for all the world.","You who are happy in a thousand homes, or overworked therein, to a dumb peace;. Whose souls are wholly centered in the life of that small group you personally love;. Who told you that you need not know or care about the sin and sorrow of the world?","To the Indifferent Women is addressed to the “indifferent women” who sit idly in their homes, only concerned with those that are directly, physically, near to them. The speaker of the poem spends these seven stanzas chastising the women for their selfishness and inability to care about the entire world. They cannot see outside of their own home. She calls upon their motherhood to spread to those that are desperate for food and a mother's love. To the Indifferent Women concludes with the statement that if men and women could come together and share their love with the whole world, all homes would be happy. She is promoting the idea that we must allow ourselves to look out from our own worlds and into those that are uncomfortable and even miserable. If we do not allow ourselves to see the world in its entirety, we may not be able to hold onto the happiness that we have created for ourselves. Those that are lucky, must help those that are not."
277,"The people I love the best
jump into work head first
without dallying in the shallows
and swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight.
They seem to become natives of that element,
the black sleek heads of seals
bouncing like half-submerged balls.
I love people who harness themselves, an ox to a heavy cart,
who pull like water buffalo, with massive patience,
who strain in the mud and the muck to move things forward,
who do what has to be done, again and again.
I want to be with people who submerge
in the task, who go into the fields to harvest
and work in a row and pass the bags along,
who are not parlor generals and field deserters
but move in a common rhythm
when the food must come in or the fire be put out.
The work of the world is common as mud.
Botched, it smears the hands, crumbles to dust.
But the thing worth doing well done
has a shape that satisfies, clean and evident.
Greek amphoras for wine or oil,
Hopi vases that held corn, are put in museums
but you know they were made to be used.
The pitcher cries for water to carry
and a person for work that is real.","I love people who harness themselves, an ox to a heavy cart, who pull like water buffalo, with massive patience, who strain in the mud and the muck to move things forward, again and again. The work of the world is common as mud. Botched, it smears the hands, crumbles to dust. But the thing worth doing well done has a shape that satisfies, clean and evident.","'To be of use' by Marge Piercy depicts one speaker's preference to be around those who work hard and understand the importance of perseverance. The poem takes the reader through metaphorical comparisons between oxen, water buffalo, and seals. Each has their own skill and confidence in their individual environments. The speaker says she is interested in people who embody these same traits. She goes on, referencing the pleasures and payoffs of hard work and connecting them to a Hopi vase and Greek amphora. Just as these creations cry out for work, so too do human beings."
278,"Paper that lets the light
shine through, this
is what could alter things.
Paper thinned by age or touching,
the kind you find in well-used books,
the back of the Koran, where a hand
has written in the names and histories,
who was born to whom,
the height and weight, who
died where and how, on which sepia date,
pages smoothed and stroked and turned
transparent with attention.
If buildings were paper, I might
feel their drift, see how easily
they fall away on a sigh, a shift
in the direction of the wind.
Maps too. The sun shines through
their borderlines, the marks
that rivers make, roads,
railtracks, mountainfolds,
Fine slips from grocery shops
that say how much was sold
and what was paid by credit card
might fly our lives like paper kites.
An architect could use all this,
place layer over layer, luminous
script over numbers over line,
and never wish to build again with brick
or block, but let the daylight break
through capitals and monoliths,
through the shapes that pride can make,
find a way to trace a grand design
with living tissue, raise a structure
never meant to last,
of paper smoothed and stroked
and thinned to be transparent,
turned into your skin.","Paper that lets the lightshine through, this is what could alter things. Paper thinned by age or touching, you find in well-used books. The sun shines through their borderlines, the marks that rivers make, roads, mountainfolds. Fine slips from grocery shops might fly our lives like paper kites.","‘Tissue’ by Imtiaz Dharker uses the metaphor of paper to speak about the impermanence of humanity. In the first lines, the poet draws attention to the significance of paper in various contexts. The back pages of a well-used book or the pages of the Koran, where names and histories are recorded, represent the accumulation of human stories and experiences. The poet highlights the nature of buildings by suggesting that if they were made of paper, they would easily crumble and disappear with a sigh or a shift of wind. The poem also suggests that an architect could utilize the transformative power of paper and light, creating layers of meaning and beauty in a structure. Rather than relying on durable materials like brick or block, the poet envisions a structure made of paper, representing the fragile nature of existence."
279,"May we raise children
who love the unloved things – the dandelion, the

Overall else, Sowder implores that children be raised to 'love the unloved things'. The 'unloved things' in this context represent all of the objects, ideas, or people that don't get a say, or aren't traditionally valued or important. The poet values kindness above all else."
280,"What makes a nation's pillars high
And its foundations strong?
What makes it mighty to defy
The foes that round it throng?

It is not gold. Its kingdoms grand
Go down in battle shock;
Its shafts are laid on sinking sand,
Not on abiding rock.

Is it the sword? Ask the red dust
Of empires passed away;
The blood has turned their stones to rust,
Their glory to decay.

And is it pride? Ah, that bright crown
Has seemed to nations sweet;
But God has struck its luster down
In ashes at his feet.

Not gold but only men can make
A people great and strong;
Men who for truth and honor's sake
Stand fast and suffer long.

Brave men who work while others sleep,
Who dare while others fly...
They build a nation's pillars deep
And lift them to the sky.","What makes a nation's pillars high                And its foundations strong?                What makes it mighty to defy                The foes that round it throng?                It is not gold.

This poem begins with the speaker presenting readers with rhetorical questions regarding where a nation's strength comes from. He then goes on to pose a few different answers before coming to the conclusion that strength comes from leaders who work harder than everyone else and are capable of inspiring those around them.
281,"In the steamer is the trout seasoned with slivers of ginger,
two sprigs of green onion, and sesame oil. We shall eat it with rice for lunch, brothers, sister, my mother who will taste the sweetest meat of the head, holding it between her fingers deftly, the way my father did weeks ago. Then he lay down to sleep like a snow-covered road winding through pines older than him, without any travelers, and lonely for no one.","In the steamer is the trout seasoned with slivers of ginger,two sprigs of green onion, and sesame oil.

Then he lay down to sleep like a snow-covered road winding through pines older than him, without any travelers, and lonely for no one.","'Eating Together' by Li-Young Lee is a simple yet effective poem about the loss a family suffered and the time they spend together. In the first lines of 'Eating Together,' the speaker begins by describing what his family is going to have to eat. These lines are a stark contrast with the final four, in which the poet is far more lyrical and emotional. Between these sections, the speaker notes that he's there with his mother, brothers, and sister. Together, they're sitting down for a meal that includes trout, ginger, and more. His mother has a new role at the table, he says. She tastes the “sweetest meat of the head,” as his father used to do. With this line, it becomes clear that the family has suffered a loss. The final four lines, or quatrain, describe the father through a simile. He's compared to a snow-covered road that has no travelers and is lonely for none. He went to sleep, likely a euphemism for dying, and now the family dynamic has changed. But, they are still together, and life goes on."
282,"I
In the dark the river spins,
Laughs and ripples never ceasing,
Swells to gurgle under arches,
Swishes past the hows of barges.
In its haste to swirl away
From the stone walls of the city
That has lamps that weight the eddies
Down with snaky silver glitter.
As it flies it calls me with it
Through the meadows to the sea.

I close the door on it, draw the bolts,
Climb the stairs to my silent room;
But through the window that swings open
Comes again its shuttle-song,
Spinning love and night and madness,
Madness of the spring at sea.

The streets are full of lilacs.
Lilacs in boys' buttonholes,
Lilacs at women's waists;
Arms full of lilacs, people trail behind them through the moist night
Long swirls of fragrance.
Fragrance of gardens,
Fragrance of hedgerows where they have wandered
All the May day,
Where the lovers have held each other's hands
And lavished vermilion kisses
Under the portent of the swaying plumes
Of the funereal lilacs.

The streets are full of lilacs
That trail long swirls and eddies of fragrance,
Arabesques of fragrance,
Like the arabesques that form and fade,
In the fleeting ripples of the jade-green river.","The streets are full of lilacs. They trail long swirls and eddies of fragrance, like the fleeting ripples of the jade-green river. Fragrance of gardens, hedgerows where they have wandered all the May day, lavished vermilion kisses.","Quai de la Tournelle' by John Dos Passos is a poem about a lost love and how the sights and sounds of the Seine River in Paris bring that love to mind. The poem begins with the narrator looking out at the Seine River and describing the conflict he feels as it “swirl[s] away.” He describes it as being both “dark” and as “Laughing,” setting up the backdrop for the tumult of emotions that he will expound on. In an attempt to escape from the powerful emotions that hearing and seeing the river unearth, the speaker flees into his home. Bolting the door behind him, he ascends to his room where he hopes to find silence. Instead, an open window lets the sounds of the river into his room. It is at this point in the poem that the reader will come to understand that the narrator has lost a love of the utmost importance to him. He feels this loss intensely and is further reminded of it on the bank of the river. Additionally, as he looks below him to the street, it seems as if every passerby is in possession of a lilac flower (symbolizing love and youthful innocence, two things he has lost). The smell of the flowers has a similar impact on the speaker as the sound of the river. The poem concludes with the narrator relating his loss of love to the formation and dissipation of the smell of flowers and the rapidly running river. "
283,"There is a wolf in me . . . fangs pointed for tearing gashes . . . a red tongue for raw meat . . . and the hot lapping of blood—I keep this wolf because the wilderness gave it to me and the wilderness will not let it go. There is a fox in me . . . a silver-gray fox . . . I sniff and guess . . . I pick things out of the wind and air . . . I nose in the dark night and take sleepers and eat them and hide the feathers . . . I circle and loop and double-cross.
There is a hog in me . . . a snout and a belly . . . a machinery for eating and grunting . . . a machinery for sleeping satisfied in the sun—I got this too from the wilderness and the wilderness will not let it go.
There is a fish in me . . . I know I came from salt-blue water-gates . . . I scurried with shoals of herring . . . I blew waterspouts with porpoises . . . before land was . . . before the water went down . . . before Noah . . . before the first chapter of Genesis.

There is an eagle in me and a mockingbird . . . and the eagle flies among the Rocky Mountains of my dreams and fights among the Sierra crags of what I want . . . and the mockingbird warbles in the early forenoon before the dew is gone, warbles in the underbrush of my Chattanoogas of hope, gushes over the blue Ozark foothills of my wishes—And I got the eagle and the mockingbird from the wilderness.
O, I got a zoo, I got a menagerie, inside my ribs, under my bony head, under my red-valve heart—and I got something else: it is a man-child heart, a woman-child heart: it is a father and mother and lover: it came from God-Knows-Where: it is going to God-Knows-Where—For I am the keeper of the zoo: I say yes and no: I sing and kill and work: I am a pal of the world: I came from the wilderness.","There is a wolf in me and a fox in me. I have a snout and a belly for eating and grunting. There is an eagle and a mockingbird in me, too. I am a man-child with a man's heart and a woman's mind. I came from the wilderness.","“Wilderness” by Carl Sandburg describes the animalistic, spiritual life forces that reside inside one man's body and the abilities he gained from them. The poem begins with the speaker describing how he is made up of a number of different animals. They are so integral to his being it is like they are inside him. He begins by speaking about the “blood-red” wolf who gives him undeniable strength. He then moves onto the “silver-grey fox” who is both cunning and vicious. The next stanzas speak of his ability to keep a “hog” and an extremely unattractive baboon inside of him. These creatures are not obvious in their benefits but the speaker makes clear why they matter to him. The final animals are the most interesting. He contains the first fish-like creature to ever walk on the planet, a sign of his spiritually important pedigree. Lastly, he has a dichotomy of birds. The final section speaks on the narrator's dedication to maintaining his interior zoo as well as all that which makes him a lover, mother and father. He is a part of the world and will take care of all that which he contributes to it."
284,"Our embrace lasted too long.
We loved right down to the bone.
I hear the bones grind, I see
our two skeletons.

the clatter of your shoes

Tonight I am going to sleep alone
on the bedclothes of purity.
Aloneness

Aloneness
will enlarge the walls of the room,
I will open the window
and the large, frosty air will enter,

and human concerns,
misfortune of others, saintliness of others.

very rarely.","Our embrace lasted too long. We loved right down to the bone. I am waiting until you leave, till the clatter of your shoes is heard no more. I will open the window and the large, frosty air will enter.

This piece reflects a story of a woman whose lengthy relationship has exposed her own vices as well as her partner's for too long of a time. Because of this, she frees herself of her significant other and goes on a journey for freedom. During this poem, one is reminded of the beauties of being alone. The author reaffirms her need for solidarity in the final stanza. Without hesitation, the speaker goes full force into a life of new meaning. She undergoes a process of finding herself again. As her mind is freed, she is able to become in tune with the needs and happenings that are present in the world."
285,"We Africans came to Berlin to sing
and recite poetry. We had an agenda:
remembering our anthems of loss,
galloping, consuming,
the pillage, the cries
like forest fires, like haunted children,
how can we, how can we even
begin to redress?
Enraged, we wanted revenge
and then, Chiwoniso, you stepped on the stage and
you opened your mouth and
every stolen river of platinum and gold
poured out of your mouth in song;
your voice etched us out of the night
and doubled the light in each of us.
You restored all the treasure-houses
from Benin to Zimbabwe, Mapungubwe to Cairo;
Africa moved its golden bones,
shook off its heavy chains
and danced again.
That night I thought
if only
love could purchase bread,
Africans would not be hungry.","We Africans came to Berlin to sing and recite poetry. We had an agenda:remembering our anthems of loss. We wanted revenge. And then, Chiwoniso, you stepped on the stage and opened your mouth and every stolen river of platinum and gold poured out of your mouth in song.","Stolen Rivers Analysis The very first line of the poem, which can be read in full here, and the use of first-person “We” themselves suggest that the poet and to whom (Chiwoniso) this poem is dedicated both came to Berlin from Africa to do their jobs like singing songs and reciting poetry. The “We” also represents the whole African community, who shift to different parts of the world to earn their livelihood. Since, with “We” she is representing the whole community of Africans; this first-person pronoun can be understood as a representative of all those Africans who live in different parts of the world. The poet further says that they both had the same agenda, that is; singing and reciting poems. But how can they both forget their anthems of loss, like galloping, consuming, the pillage, the cries, like forest fires, like haunted children that they had to face due to racism, how can they forget the loss they had to bear due to racism, and how can they redress the loss caused by this apartheid—a system of segregation or discrimination on the grounds of race in South Africa. In further lines, when the poet says: “Enraged, we wanted revenge”, it means that not only they both (Chiwoniso and Phillippa Yaa De Villiers) were enraged at what they had to face for being black in colour, but they too experienced a great loss of their properties and personal belongings. However, when, the poet says, Chiwoniso stepped on the stage and opened her mouth that is; started singing beautiful songs with great and revolutionary lyrics, the people of Africa were highly impressed and inspired. Every stolen river of platinum and gold poured out of your mouth in song was like an inspiring and revolutionary message for all Africans living in different parts of the world. The poet says that your voice (Chiwoniso's voice) not only brought them out of the night or the darkness of discrimination and racism, but it also doubled the light in each of them, that is, all the Africans became more enlightened and aware of their rights. The poet says that from Benin to Zimbabwe, Mapungubwe to Cairo all got mesmerized, enthralled, and impressed by Chiwoniso's singing, they were restored with all the treasure-houses. With the presence of Chiwoniso, Africa not only moved its golden bones, but it also broke free from its heavy chains or shackles of racism. As Chiwoniso came into their lives with her singing, Africa also started dancing again. The last lines of the poem are very poignant, and they really touch hearts when the poet says: “love could purchase bread, Africans would not be hungry,” which shows that on the night when the poet was writing this poem, she was very sad, and feeling dejected to the rampant racism, remembering the past loss she had to bear. Through the last two lines, the poet also gives the message, by saying if the whites had love, respect in their hearts, and had not discriminated against them on the basis of their colours, neither the Africans had to stay hungry, nor they had to experience the loss, caused by racial discrimination. That night could either be the night when the poet wrote this poem, or this night could also be the night when the great soul of Africa, Chiwoniso Maraire died. Thus, the poem, Stolen River, is a masterpiece by Phillippa Yaa De Villiers, who was a well-known writer at her own age."
286,"It was many and many a year ago,
In a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabel Lee;
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me.
I was a child and she was a child,
In this kingdom by the sea,
But we loved with a love that was more than love—
I and my Annabel Lee—
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven
Coveted her and me.
And this was the reason that, long ago,
In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee;
So that her highborn kinsmen came
And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulchre
In this kingdom by the sea.
The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
Went envying her and me—
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,
In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we—
Of many far wiser than we—
And neither the angels in Heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,
In her sepulchre there by the sea—
In her tomb by the sounding sea.","It was many and many a year ago, in a kingdom by the sea, that a maiden there lived whom you may know by the name of Annabel Lee.

And neither the angels in Heaven above nor the demons down under the sea can ever dissever my soul from the soul of my bride.","Edgar Allan Poe writes Annabel Lee in the most unique tone, as was one of trademarks. When the poem begins, it sounds like a fairy tale and gives the reader a feeling of all that is good and happy. But underneath this joyful tone is a tone more ominous, and Poe uses certain words and phrases that give this eerie feeling. Partway through the poem, the readers begin to understand that this is not a common fairy tale. Rather, this is a dark and terrifying story. The tones and rhythms Poe use create an almost hypnotic effect.

The poem reads like a nursery rhyme in the way that it sounds, allowing the readers to venture back into childhood days in order to relate with the speaker. However, the content of the poem is not suitable for children, and so the contrast between the rhyme and rhythm of the poem and the content leaves the reader feeling deeply moved. This is a skill Poe used in many of his works. His tone is entirely unique. He has a way of grasping the readers’ attention and pulling them into his work before he reveals the truly dark and sometimes cynical nature of the content."
287,"If I were doing my Laundry I’d wash my dirty Iran

In 'Homework' by Allen Ginsberg, the speaker feels as if the dirty places are clothes. He tries to wash them clean and remove the dirt of environmental degradation, politics, and pollution. There is a reference to a variety of countries, rivers, and places in this poem. The poet refers to countries such as Iran, the United States, Alaska, Russia, and China. Moreover, the poet refers to continents such as Africa, Asia, and North America. He also talks about the rivers namely Amazon, Rhine, Hudson, Thames, and Neckar, and other water bodies such as Carin and Gulf of Mexico, Love Canal, Mediterranean basin, and Lake Eerie. Apart from that, there are other references in the poem such as the North Pole, Rocky Flats, Los Alamos, Parthenon, and Sphinx. By pointing out these places, Ginsberg highlights the major causes of natural degradation in the mentioned places. Last but not least, he wants to purify them by symbolically washing, scrubbing, wiping, rubbing, rinsing, and wringing those places."
288,"They plan. They build. All spaces are gridded,
filled with permutations of possibilities.
The buildings are in alignment with the roads
which meet at desired points
linked by bridges all hang
in the grace of mathematics.
They build and will not stop.
Even the sea draws back
and the skies surrender.
They erase the flaws,
the blemishes of the past, knock off
useless blocks with dental dexterity.
All gaps are plugged
with gleaming gold.
The country wears perfect rows of shining teeth.
Anaesthesia, amnesia, hypnosis.
They have the means.
They have it all so it will not hurt,
so history is new again.
The piling will not stop.
The drilling goes right through
the fossils of last century.
But my heart would not bleed

to stain the blueprint
of our past’s tomorrow.","They plan. They build. All spaces are gridded,                filled with permutations of possibilities.

They have it all so it will not hurt,                so history is new again.","'The Planners' by Boey Kim Cheng is an effective poem about the impact of industrialization and development. The speaker spends the three stanzas of this free verse poem addressing the impact that the “planners” have on the world around him and others. He suggests that the constant desire to build a new, better city is detrimental to one's understanding of the past. At the end of the poem, the speaker discusses how as a poet, the new world that's been created around him is entirely uninspiring. His poet's heart is not going to bleed for these sites, sounds, and lack of history that surrounds him (or that he believes is going to surround him as things change in the future)."
289,"They came in to the little town
A semi-naked band subdued and silent
All that remained of their tribe.
They came here to the place of their old bora ground
Where now the many white men hurry about like ants.
Notice of the estate agent reads: 'Rubbish May Be Tipped Here'.
Now it half covers the traces of the old bora ring.
'We are as strangers here now, but the white tribe are the strangers.
We belong here, we are of the old ways.
We are the corroboree and the bora ground,
We are the old ceremonies, the laws of the elders.
We are the wonder tales of Dream Time, the tribal legends told.
We are the past, the hunts and the laughing games, the wandering camp fires.
We are the lightening bolt over Gaphembah Hill
Quick and terrible,
And the Thunderer after him, that loud fellow.
We are the quiet daybreak paling the dark lagoon.
We are the shadow-ghosts creeping back as the camp fires burn low.
We are nature and the past, all the old ways
Gone now and scattered.

In the first part of this poem, the speaker, someone outside the Aboriginal Australian community, describes a small group, all the remains of a specific tribe, coming into town. They come to the place of their “old bora ground” and appear like strangers amongst the changes that the “many white men” have made. The poem transitions into the perspective of the small group, utilizing the word “We” at the beginning of successive lines. The group of Aboriginal Australians highlights the importance of the land, their culture, and their past. They allude to all that's been lost and the remaining strength of their community. As the poem concludes, the group of speakers also describe how British colonialism has affected the land itself and the animals that used to reside there. The poem ends with the haunting line “We are going” suggesting that soon, all remaining members of this tribe, and tribes across Australia, will be lost."

Whole of an ancient evil, I sleep sound.","Stay, if you list, O passer by the way; yet night approaches; better not to stay.

Housman is a short poem told from the perspective of someone who knows that he's about to die. In the first lines of 'XII: An Epitaph,' the speaker talks to the listener, a visitor or passerby of some kind. This person, he says, is welcome to stay but probably shouldn't because the night is on the way. Night, it soon becomes clear, is a metaphor for death, something that's coming to claim the speaker. The speaker spends the remaining lines of the poem describing death as something he's welcoming. He doesn't mind that it's coming for him as it'll be a welcome relief to the ancient evil that has been tormenting him."

The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea
In a beautiful pea-green boat,
They took some honey, and plenty of money,
Wrapped up in a five-pound note.
The Owl looked up to the stars above,
And sang to a small guitar,
""O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love,
What a beautiful Pussy you are,
You are,
You are!
What a beautiful Pussy you are!""

Pussy said to the Owl, ""You elegant fowl!
How charmingly sweet you sing!
O let us be married! too long we have tarried:
But what shall we do for a ring?""
They sailed away, for a year and a day,
To the land where the Bong-Tree grows
And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood
With a ring at the end of his nose,
His nose,
His nose,
With a ring at the end of his nose.

""Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling
Your ring?"" Said the Piggy, ""I will.""
So they took it away, and were married next day
By the Turkey who lives on the hill.
They dined on mince, and slices of quince,
Which they ate with a runcible spoon;
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,
They danced by the light of the moon,

This nonsense poem starts with the boat journey of the two main characters named in the title. They profess their love to one another and decide to get married. They need to find a ring and their search takes them to a pig. That pig sells them its nose ring for one shilling and they get married. After that, there is much celebrating and the poem ends with the owl and pussy-cat dancing under the moon."
292,"Announced by all the trumpets of the sky,
Arrives the snow, and, driving o'er the fields,
Seems nowhere to alight: the whited air
Hides hills and woods, the river, and the heaven,
And veils the farm-house at the garden's end.
The sled and traveller stopped, the courier's feet
Delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit
Around the radiant fireplace, enclosed
In a tumultuous privacy of storm.
Come see the north wind's masonry.
Out of an unseen quarry evermore
Furnished with tile, the fierce artificer
Curves his white bastions with projected roof
Round every windward stake, or tree, or door.
Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild work
So fanciful, so savage, nought cares he
For number or proportion. Mockingly,
On coop or kennel he hangs Parian wreaths;
A swan-like form invests the hidden thorn;
Fills up the farmer's lane from wall to wall,
Maugre the farmer's sighs; and, at the gate,
A tapering turret overtops the work.
And when his hours are numbered, and the world
Is all his own, retiring, as he were not,
Leaves, when the sun appears, astonished Art
To mimic in slow structures, stone by stone,
Built in an age, the mad wind's night-work,
The frolic architecture of the snow.","Announced by all the trumpets of the sky, the snow Arrives the snow, and, driving o'er the fields,                Seems nowhere to alight.                The sled and traveller stopped, the courier's feet                Delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit around the radiant fireplace, enclosed in a tumultuous privacy of storm.                Come see the north wind's masonry.                Furnished with tile, the fierce artificer curves his white bastions with projected roof                Round every windward stake, or tree, or door.","'The Snow-Storm' by Ralph Waldo Emerson is a colorful and joyful depiction of a night-long snowstorm and the “art” that's revealed in the morning. The poem depicts the sudden appearance of the storm and the way in which everyone had to shelter inside. All travel was stopped and everyone turned inward to themselves and their housemates. But, outside their homes, the wind—a skilled and powerful craftsman— was working on his structures. When the sun finally came up the next morning the speaker took note of everything that had been created overnight. There were turrets and bastions, there were swan-like creations and wreaths that appeared to be made of marble. Discover more Ralph Waldo Emerson poems here."
293,"I wake and feel the city trembling.
Yes, there is something unsettled in the air And the earth is uncertain.
And so it was for the tenor Caruso.
He couldn’t sleep—you know how the ovation Rings in your ears, and you re-sing your part.
And then the ceiling trembled
And the floor moved. He ran into the street. Never had Naples given him such a reception!
The air was darker than Vesuvius. “O mamma mia,”
He cried, “I’ve lost my voice!”
At that moment the hideous voice of Culture, Hysterical woman, thrashing her arms and legs, Shrieked from the ruins.
At that moment everyone became a performer. Otello and Don Giovanni And Figaro strode on the midmost stage.
In the high window of a burning castle Lucia raved. Black horses
Plunged through fire, dragging the wild bells.
The curtains were wrapped in smoke. Tin swords Were melting; masks and ruffs
Burned—and the costumes of the peasants’ chorus.
Night fell. The white moon rose And sank in the Pacific. The tremors Passed under the waves. And Death rested.

Now, as we stand idle,
Watching the silent, bowler-hatted man,
The engineer, who writes in the smoking field;
Now as he hands the paper to a boy,
Who takes it and runs to a group of waiting men, And they disperse and move toward their wagons,
Mules bray and the wagons move—
Wait! Before you start
(Already the wheels are rattling on the stones)
Say, did your fathers cross the dry Sierras To build another London?
Do Americans always have to be second-rate?
Wait! For there are spirits
In the earth itself, or the air, or sea. Where are the aboriginal American devils?
Cloud shadows, pine shadows
Falling across the bright Pacific bay ... (Already they have nailed rough boards together)
Wait only for the wind
That rustles in the eucalyptus tree. Wait only for the light
That trembles on the petals of a rose.
(The mortar sets—banks are the first to stand) Wait for a rose, and you may wait forever.
The silent man mops his head and drinks Cold lemonade. “San Francisco Is a city second only to Paris.”

Every night, at the end of America
We taste our wine, looking at the Pacific. How sad it is, the end of America!
While we were waiting for the land They’d finished it—with gas drums
On the hilltops, cheap housing in the valleys
Where lives are mean and wretched. But the banks thrive and the realtors Rejoice—they have their America.
Still, there is something unsettled in the air. Out there on the Pacific There’s no America but the Marines.
Whitman was wrong about the People,
But right about himself. The land is within.
At the end of the open road we come to ourselves.
Though mad Columbus follows the sun Into the sea, we cannot follow.
We must remain, to serve the returning sun,
And to set tables for death.
For we are the colonists of Death—
Not, as some think, of the English.
And we are preparing thrones for him to sit, Poems to read, and beds In which it may please him to rest.
This is the land
The pioneers looked for, shading their eyes Against the sun—a murmur of serious life.","I wake and feel the city trembling. There is something unsettled in the air And the earth is uncertain.

We must remain, to serve the returning sun, and to set tables for death.","'Lines Written Near San Francisco' by Louis Simpson presents a lifeless description of the city that appears to the poet as “a murmur of serious life.” The poet, Simpson sets the mood of the poem from the very first stanza. In the first section, the poet refers to the opera singers who once mesmerized the people with their unique voices. Thereafter, in the next section of the poem, the poet describes how the brick-and-mortar dots the city. The city lacks the free lands where once poets like Simpson, Walt Whitman wandered and composed poems. In the last section of the poem, Simpson presents dark imagery. Here, the speaker laments the loss of innocence for the rise of harsh modernity."

Where nobody ever says ""No"";
Where no one says anything- so
There is no one but me.","I have a house where I go when there are too many people, where nobody ever says ""No""; where no one says anything, so there is no one but me. I have a home where I can go, where I'm alone, and no one can be; where nobody says anything.","Solitude' by A.A. Milne is a very simple poem that discusses Christopher Robin's “house” where he goes to when he wants to be alone. This “house” is somewhere that no one can spend time but him. It's in a position far enough from his real home that he doesn't have to listen to anyone else talk. When he needs to get away from all the voices in his home he goes there for some peace and quiet. While there, he is in total control of his small world. The short lines of this poem are full of rhyme and rhythm and were written to be relatable to a young audience reading or hearing them read aloud."

The speaker of this piece imagines himself on his boat sailing across the scenic Cayuga Lake. He prefers sailing on the lake rather than driving on the road. His attitude towards cars seems dismissive as he calls the people who use them “modern creep[s].” They are always in a hurry and keep honking. It annoys the speaker the most, and it gets reflected in the poem's tone. Besides, the speaker is free-spirited and prefers the openness of the lake rather than the hustle and bustle of the roads. In totality, this poem speaks about the speaker's preferences in life."
296,"A Rock, A River, A Tree
Hosts to species long since departed,
Marked the mastodon,
The dinosaur, who left dried tokens
Of their sojourn here
On our planet floor,
Any broad alarm of their hastening doom
Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages.

But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully,
Come, you may stand upon my
Back and face your distant destiny,
But seek no haven in my shadow.
I will give you no hiding place down here.

You, created only a little lower than
The angels, have crouched too long in
The bruising darkness
Have lain too long
Face down in ignorance.
Your mouths spilling words

Armed for slaughter.
The Rock cries out to us today, you may stand upon me,
But do not hide your face.

Across the wall of the world,
A River sings a beautiful song. It says,
Come, rest here by my side.

Each of you, a bordered country,
Delicate and strangely made proud,
Yet thrusting perpetually under siege.
Your armed struggles for profit
Have left collars of waste upon
My shore, currents of debris upon my breast.
Yet today I call you to my riverside,
If you will study war no more. Come,
Clad in peace, and I will sing the songs
The Creator gave to me when I and the
Tree and the rock were one.
Before cynicism was a bloody sear across your
Brow and when you yet knew you still
Knew nothing.
The River sang and sings on.

There is a true yearning to respond to
The singing River and the wise Rock.
So say the Asian, the Hispanic, the Jew
The African, the Native American, the Sioux,
The Catholic, the Muslim, the French, the Greek
The Irish, the Rabbi, the Priest, the Sheik,
The Gay, the Straight, the Preacher,
The privileged, the homeless, the Teacher.
They hear. They all hear
The speaking of the Tree.

They hear the first and last of every Tree
Speak to humankind today. Come to me, here beside the River.
Plant yourself beside the River.

Each of you, descendant of some passed
On traveller, has been paid for.
You, who gave me my first name, you,
Pawnee, Apache, Seneca, you
Cherokee Nation, who rested with me, then
Forced on bloody feet,
Left me to the employment of
Other seekers—desperate for gain,
Starving for gold.
You, the Turk, the Arab, the Swede, the German, the Eskimo, the Scot,
You the Ashanti, the Yoruba, the Kru, bought,
Sold, stolen, arriving on the nightmare
Praying for a dream.
Here, root yourselves beside me.
I am that Tree planted by the River,
Which will not be moved.
I, the Rock, I the River, I the Tree
I am yours—your passages have been paid.
Lift up your faces, you have a piercing need
For this bright morning dawning for you.
History, despite its wrenching pain
Cannot be unlived, but if faced
With courage, need not be lived again.

Lift up your eyes upon
This day breaking for you.
Give birth again
To the dream.

Women, children, men,
Take it into the palms of your hands,
Mold it into the shape of your most
Private need. Sculpt it into
The image of your most public self.
Lift up your hearts
Each new hour holds new chances
For a new beginning.
Do not be wedded forever
To fear, yoked eternally
To brutishness.

The horizon leans forward,
Offering you space to place new steps of change.
Here, on the pulse of this fine day
You may have the courage
To look up and out and upon me, the
Rock, the River, the Tree, your country.
No less to Midas than the mendicant.
No less to you now than the mastodon then.

Here, on the pulse of this new day
You may have the grace to look up and out
And into your sister’s eyes, and into
Your brother’s face, your country
And say simply
Very simply
With hope—
Good morning.","A Rock, a River, and a Tree are the first and last of every Tree to speak to humankind today. The Rock cries out to us today, you may stand upon me, but do not hide your face.

This poem begins with a short depiction of the lost era when ancient creatures existed. However, with time, they lost. Now, the speaker says even nature, being the essence of life, is now on the verge of extinction. Therefore, the speaker of this poem urges everyone to join hands and cherish a better future not only for Americans but for the whole world. She hints at the voices of the rock, river, and tree to draw home the fact that nature is not kind anymore. Nature has changed a little, she is firm now, but her softness still exists. Therefore, humans have to take a pledge of saving nature as well as for the betterment of humankind."

To this shining bliss in the blue!

The speaker of the poem talks with a butterfly that has come to the linden tree. She was playing under the tree. After discovering that “exquisite” butterfly, she could not help but go near it. Thereafter, she held it with her hands carefully. Now, while she holds the creature in her hand, she can observe its marvelous beauty closely. She cannot decode the “eternal mystery” of the butterfly. Once it was a caterpillar creeping in the dust. But, now being a butterfly, it does not have its previous ugliness. This mystery enthralls the speaker and all she wants to break her chrysalis just like the butterfly."

Fat, I wonder at her delicate angles.

Adjusts to the observer with an airy poise

What I have forgotten.

Mourning. Her smile shows it.

Every morning, shall never get over what
i do not remember.

But forget her reasons.

She would support him in fights against powerful enemies, join him in the darkest of night, and live with him in the wild world, sleeping on a bed of moss and protecting him from harm."

rich chestnut crown,
and soft grey throat,
and bright red bill,

even the strange pink legs.
And when I closed my eyes again
I could hear him whisper 
in his hybrid Creole accent

I have taken your life
so that some night a man
might open a book
and run his hand over your feathers,

so that he could come close enough
to study your pale brown flecks,
your white chin patch,
and the electric green of your neck,

so that he might approach
without frightening you into the sky,
and wonder how strange
to the earth he has become,

so that he might see by his lamp light
the glistening in your eye
then take to the air
and fly alongside you.","Early this morning                in a rumpled bed, I saw on the ceiling                the figure of John J.

The poem begins with the speaker explaining that early “this morning” he was in bed. While relaxing there, he saw a moving image of the naturalist John J. Audubon on his ceiling. The man was kneeling down next to a duck he shot and speaking to it. Through Audubon's words, the speaker explains why the duck was shot and what Audubon hoped would come of the death. By giving a larger percentage of the population a chance to study animals in detail, specifically birds, the speaker believes Audubon wanted to bridge the gap between the species. Perhaps, a viewer would come to love and understand the bird as they never have."

Where there aren't no Ten Commandments an' a man can raise a thirst;
For the temple-bells are callin', an' it's there that I would be —
By the old Moulmein Pagoda, looking lazy at the sea;
On the road to Mandalay,
Where the old Flotilla lay,
With our sick beneath the awnings when we went to Mandalay!
On the road to Mandalay,
Where the flyin'-fishes play,
An' the dawn comes up like thunder outer China 'crost the Bay!","By the old Moulmein Pagoda, lookin' lazy at the sea, there's a Burma girl a-settin', and I know she thinks o' me. The wind is in the palm-trees, and the temple-bells they say: ""Come you back, you British soldier; come you back to Mandalay!""","Mandalay' by Rudyard Kipling features the reminiscences of a soldier looking back on his time in Burma alongside a woman he loved. The stanzas of this poem are fairly straightforward as the speaker walks the reader through the moments surrounding his encounter with a specific woman. He met her in Burma, and now after he's left, he's longing for her. The soldier describes his distaste for London and the simple fact that he'd like to be somewhere else, somewhere unfamiliar and exotic. Throughout the poem, Kipling makes references to people and places as well as customs in Burma that his speaker familiarized himself with. This helps create a very specific atmosphere for his memories and allows them to contrast well against the soldier's present home."
302,"They do not live in the world,
Are not in time and space.
From birth to death hurled
No word do they have, not one
To plant a foot upon,
Were never in any place.

For with names the world was called
Out of the empty air,
With names was built and walled,
Line and circle and square,
Dust and emerald;
Snatched from deceiving death
By the articulate breath.

But these have never trod
Twice the familiar track,
Never never turned back
Into the memoried day.
All is new and near
In the unchanging Here
Of the fifth great day of God,
That shall remain the same,
Never shall pass away.

On the sixth day we came","They do not live in the world, they are not in time and space. They have never trod the familiar track, never turned back into the memoried day. With names the world was called                Out of the empty air,                With names was built and walled.","The Animals' by Edwin Muir describes the creation of non-human animals and the inherent vulnerability that stems from their inability to speak for themselves. The poem begins with the speaker stating that animals live in a world that does not feel the touch of time. They are elevated above humanity and remembered as they were before God made humankind. Additionally, he makes it clear that they have a weakness. They are unable to speak for themselves. This factor has made their lives more tenuous. In the following stanzas, the speaker describes the creation of the world. He is recalling or imagining the day on which all manner of elements existed and animals were created. It was here, before humans were made, that there was peace. Animals moved freely, without restraint throughout the world. Although one cannot return to this time, it is possible to imagine. "
303,"Dear Basketball,
From the moment
I started rolling my dad’s tube socks
And shooting imaginary
Game-winning shots
In the Great Western Forum
I knew one thing was real:
I fell in love with you.
A love so deep I gave you my all
From my mind & body
To my spirit & soul.
As a six-year-old boy
Deeply in love with you
I never saw the end of the tunnel.
I only saw myself
Running out of one.
And so I ran.
I ran up and down every court
After every loose ball for you.
You asked for my hustle
I gave you my heart
Because it came with so much more.
I played through the sweat and hurt
Not because challenge called me
But because YOU called me.
I did everything for YOUBecause that’s what you do
When someone makes you feel as
Alive as you’ve made me feel.
You gave a six-year-old boy his Laker dream
And I’ll always love you for it.
But I can’t love you obsessively for much longer.
This season is all I have left to give.
My heart can take the pounding
My mind can handle the grind
But my body knows it’s time to say goodbye.
And that’s OK.
I’m ready to let you go.
I want you to know now
So we both can savor every moment we have left together.
The good and the bad.
We have given each other
All that we have.
And we both know, no matter what I do next
I’ll always be that kid
With the rolled up socks
Garbage can in the corner
:05 seconds on the clock
Ball in my hands.
5 … 4 … 3 … 2 … 1
Love you always,
Kobe","Dear Basketball, I fell in love with you as a six-year-old boy. I ran up and down every court after every loose ball for you. I’ll always love you for it. But I can’t love you obsessively for much longer.","Dear Basketball' by Kobe Bryant is a moving poem that was written as an announcement of the Lakers star's retirement from basketball. The letter, which is in the form of a poem, separated into stanzas, takes the reader through Bryant's emotional connection to the game. He describes what it was like to find it as a child and then to work hard to do the sport justice. His love for basketball shines through in every line of 'Dear Basketball.' The poem/letter then concludes with Bryant announcing his retirement."
304,"The Laburnum top is silent, quite still
In the afternoon yellow September sunlight,
A few leaves yellowing, all its seeds fallen.
Till the goldfinch comes, with a twitching chirrup
A suddenness, a startlement, at a branch end.
Then sleek as a lizard, and alert, and abrupt,
She enters the thickness, and a machine starts up
Of chitterings, and a tremor of wings, and trillings —
The whole tree trembles and thrills.
It is the engine of her family.
She stokes it full, then flirts out to a branch-end
Showing her barred face identity mask
Then with eerie delicate whistle-chirrup whisperings
She launches away, towards the infinite
And the laburnum subsides to empty.","The goldfinch comes, with a twitching chirrup, at a branch end. Then sleek as a lizard, and alert, and abrupt, she enters the thickness, and a machine starts up. The whole tree trembles and thrills. It is the engine of her family.

'The Laburnum Top' by Ted Hughes begins with the description of the “Laburnum top”. Suddenly, a goldfinch comes and breaks the silence on the tree-top. It enters through the thickness of the laburnum leaves to its nest. And, the tree awakes from its slumber and enjoys the “chitterings”, “tremor of wings”, and “trillings” of the birds. It seems like the tree is trembling and thrilled by their presence. But, when the mother goldfinch launches herself away from the branches to the sky, the tree again comes to its previous state."
305,"In fifty years, when peace outshines
Remembrance of the battle lines,
Adventurous lads will sigh and cast
Proud looks upon the plundered past.
On summer morn or winter's night,
Their hearts will kindle for the fight,
Reading a snatch of soldier-song,
Savage and jaunty, fierce and strong;
And through the angry marching rhymes
Of blind regret and haggard mirth,
They'll envy us the dazzling times
When sacrifice absolved our earth.

Some ancient man with silver locks
Will lift his weary face to say:
'War was a fiend who stopped our clocks
Although we met him grim and gay.'
And then he'll speak of Haig's last drive,
Marvelling that any came alive
Out of the shambles that men built
And smashed, to cleanse the world of guilt.
But the boys, with grin and sidelong glance,
Will think, 'Poor grandad's day is done.'
And dream of lads who fought in France
And lived in time to share the fun.","In fifty years, when peace outshines war, lads will sigh and cast Proud looks upon the plundered past. They'll envy us the dazzling times when sacrifice absolved our earth. But the boys, with grin and sidelong glance, will think, 'Poor grandad's day is done'","The poem, Song-Books of the War, which you can read in full here, takes place years after the First World War is over; its idea of revisionist history is that the terrible leadership has been forgotten, the casualties immortalized in stone and bronze, and the pain and anguish of serving has become a game. However, Sassoon details the truth in the voice of a man, then a grandfather, who speaks plainly about the truth of the war."
306,"I. How shall the burial rite be read?
The solemn song be sung?
The requiem for the loveliest dead,
That ever died so young?
II. Her friends are gazing on her,
And on her gaudy bier,
And weep!—oh! to dishonor
Dead beauty with a tear!
III. They loved her for her wealth—
And they hated her for her pride—
But she grew in feeble health,
And they love her—that she died.
IV. They tell me (while they speak
Of her ""costly broider'd pall"")
That my voice is growing weak—
That I should not sing at all—
V. Or that my tone should be
Tun'd to such solemn song
So mournfully—so mournfully,
That the dead may feel no wrong.
VI. But she is gone above,
With young Hope at her side,
And I am drunk with love
Of the dead, who is my bride.—
VII. Of the dead—dead who lies
All perfum'd there,
With the death upon her eyes.
And the life upon her hair.
VIII. Thus on the coffin loud and long
I strike—the murmur sent
Through the gray chambers to my song,
Shall be the accompaniment.
IX. Thou diedst in thy life's June—
But thou didst not die too fair:
Thou didst not die too soon,
Nor with too calm an air.
X. From more than friends on earth,
Thy life and love are riven,
To join the untainted mirth
Of more than thrones in heaven.—

He does not yet know whether a solemn or joyous song will be sung. The speaker takes the reader to the side of the body. There, many are gathered. They mourn over her departure, crying and weeping unnecessarily. He believes that their actions dishonor her. They should not mourn but celebrate. In contrast, the mourners do not believe that the speaker should sing the songs he is singing. His voice is weak and they wish him to sing something sadder. He refuses, hits the coffin, and uses the reverberations as a part of his song. When he addresses the dead woman, who the reader learns is his wife, he tells her that while she may be dead her spirit lives on. Her love touched everything around her, so he will not mourn. He will sing a “pæan” to celebrate her life rather than a “requiem” to mourn it."

It takes place in a resort town, and tells the story of a 'travel snob' who is writing a postcard to someone unspecified about how her holiday is superior to everyone else's holiday, and how it is helping her to enrich and brighten her life.

310,"The oaks, how subtle and marine,
Bearded, and all the layered light
Above them swims; and thus the scene,
Recessed, awaits the positive night.

So, waiting, we in the grass now lie
Beneath the languorous tread of light:
The grassed, kelp-like, satisfy
The nameless motions of the air.

Upon the floor of light, and time,
Unmurmuring, of polyp made,
We rest; we are, as light withdraws,
Twin atolls on a shelf of shade.

Ages to our construction went,
Dim architecture, hour by hour:
And violence, forgot now, lent
The present stillness all its power.

The storm of noon above us rolled,
Of light the fury, furious gold,
The long drag troubling us, the depth:
Dark is unrocking, unrippling, still.

Passion and slaughter, ruth, decay
descend, minutely whispering down,
Silted down swaying streams, to lay
Foundation for our voicelessness.

All our debate is voiceless here,
As all our rage, the rage of stone;
If hope is hopeless, then fearless is fear,
And history is thus undone.

Our feet once wrought the hollow street
With echo when the lamps were dead
All windows, once our headlight glare
Disturbed the doe that, leaping fled.

I do not love you less that now
The caged heart makes iron stroke,
Or less that all that light once gave
The graduate dark should now revoke.

We live in time so little time
And we learn all so painfully,
That we may spare this hour's term
To practice for eternity.","The oaks, how subtle and marine, are bearded, and all the layered light above them swims. The grassed, kelp-like, satisfy the nameless motions of the air.

In the first part of the poem, Warren's speaker depicts a scene of peace. Two lovers rest on the forest floor looking up at the sky and trees. The speaker focuses on the power of the marine-like sky above them and the forest floor below. As Warren put it, the two are laying in the forest after the sun goes down and it feels as “though the lovers were submerged in the water”. They are submerged in human history just as the coral is submerged beneath the ocean. The two are trapped in a small amount of time they have."

before my mirror

and singing softly to myself:

Danse Russe is comic, enjoyable and lighthearted, with Williams overcoming the lack of connection he tends to feel with others and focusing on his own sense of self."
312,"When everything finally has been wrecked and further shipwrecked,
When their most ardent dream has been made hollow and unrecognizable,
They will feel inside their limbs the missing shade of blue that lingers
Against hills in the cooler hours before dark, and the moss at the foot of the forest
When green starts to leave it. What they take into their privacy (half of his embrace,
Her violence at play) are shadows of acts which have no farewells in them.
Moons unearth them. And when, in their separate dwellings, their bodies
Feel the next season come, they no longer have anyone to whom
To tell it. Clouds of reverie pass outside the window and a strange emptiness
Peers back in. If they love, it is solely to be adored, it is to scatter and gather
Themselves like hard seeds in a field made fallow by a fire someone years ago set.
In the quiet woods, from the highest trees, there is always something
Weightless falling; and he, who must realize that certain losses are irreparable,
Tells himself at night, before the darkest mirror, that vision keeps him whole.

On the verge of warm and simple sleep they tell themselves certain loves
Are like sheets of dark water, or ice forests, or husks of ships. To stop a thing
Such as this would be to halve a sound that travels out from a silent person’s
Thoughts. The imprint they make on each other’s bodies is worth any pain
They may have caused. Quiet falls around them. And when she reaches
For him the air greens like underwater light and the well-waters drop.
They will see again the shadows of insects.
They will touch the bark and feel each age of the tree fly undisturbed
Into them. If what is no longer present in them cannot be restored,
It can at least be offered. Through long bewildered dusks, stalks grow;
Rains fill and pass out of clouds; animals hover at the edges of fields
With eyes like black pools. For nothing cannot be transformed;
Pleasure and failure feed each other daily. Do not think any breeze,
Any grain of light, shall be withheld. All the stars will sail out for them.","When everything finally has been wrecked and further shipwrecked, when their most ardent dream has been made hollow and unrecognizable, they will feel inside their limbs the missing shade of blue.

She asks the question, are the happy moments of a relationship worth the sadness that comes after it ends? The title balances this idea, with the ‘omen’ of a broken future mirrored by the ‘hope’ that it can continue forever. The poem is beautiful to read, filled with imagery and complex ideas of love and heartbreak. Klink talks about love as if it were something that fills the body up, and something that can just as easily leave someone hollow. Yet, for Klink, these moments of heartbreak are justified by ‘all the stars’ that populate the relationship with beautiful memories, ones that last forever."

Looks forth, and sees the fleet

The tidings of despair.

Longfellow wrote the piece about a father who had lost his son, in a way that only a father could and informs his story with a powerful and biblical source. In The Chamber Over the Gate, Longfellow focuses on the grief David feels for Absalom, and the way that grief resounds throughout Jerusalem. The biblical account that informs the poem, however, tells the story of a son who fought against his father in every way, by slaying another of his sons, and by usurping his throne. And yet, at the end of it all, David feels nothing but remorse and grief for his fallen son, and never stops being the man’s father, even in the wake of his betrayals. This incredible love that a father can feel for his son is at the heart of Longfellow’s work, and the message resounds as surely as David’s grief did throughout the city of Jerusalem."
314,"My father worked with a horse-plough,
His shoulders globed like a full sail strung
Between the shafts and the furrow.
The horses strained at his clicking tongue.

An expert. He would set the wing
And fit the bright steel-pointed sock.
The sod rolled over without breaking.
At the headrig, with a single pluck

Of reins, the sweating team turned round
And back into the land. His eye
Narrowed and angled at the ground,
Mapping the furrow exactly.

I stumbled in his hobnailed wake,
Fell sometimes on the polished sod;
Sometimes he rode me on his back
Dipping and rising to his plod.

I wanted to grow up and plough,
To close one eye, stiffen my arm.
All I ever did was follow
In his broad shadow round the farm.

I was a nuisance, tripping, falling,
Yapping always. But today

Behind me, and will not go away","My father worked with a horse-plough, his shoulders globed like a full sail strung between the shafts and the furrow.

The first half of this piece is a worshipful description by a son of his father, as he remembers how he looked and acted as he plowed their fields. The father is described as being powerful, strong beyond measure, and in total control of his “team.” The furrows he plows are pristine, and the son follows clumsily behind, unable to emulate his father's strength. In the very last stanza of the poem the roles are reversed and the speaker is now the strong one with his father depending on him and following him as he plows."

The poem begins with the speakers stating two factors that make their lives hard to understand and navigate. There is an ever-present choice between loving and/or being a “feather or a rock.” The poem continues with the two complementing one another and the strength they maintain to get through everyday life. Eventually, the second speaker refers to life as being filled with “persistent dread.” The darkness of this moment is offset with playful banter between the two. The poem concludes with the first speaker referencing “martial law” and the Garden of Eden as the source of many of their problems."
316,"Without that once clear aim, the path of flight
To follow for a lifetime through white air,
This century chokes me under the roots of night

Truth lies in dungeons, from which drifts no whisper:

And tortures and war, in dark and smoky rumor,
But on men’s buried lives there falls no light.

And fog drown every cry: at corners of day
Road drills explore new areas of pain,
Nor summer nor light may reach down here to play.

The poem begins by lamenting the loss of artistic clarity and quickly goes on to blame this loss on the writer's historical circumstances. The poet regards their environment as stifling, claustrophobic, and utterly incompatible with poetic expression. However, it becomes clear that he also regards poetry as his best chance of transcending the horrors that surround him, and so feels compelled to keep writing as best he can. Like many of Stephen Spender's poems, 'Without That Once Clear Aim' is widely studied both in the UK and elsewhere."
317,"I am the river of Spavinaw,
I am the river of pain;
Sadness and gladness must answer my law;
Measure for measure I give, and withdraw
Back through the hills of the Spavinaw,
Hiding away from the plain.
I am the river of Spavinaw;
I sing the songs of the world;
Dashing and whirling, swishing and swirling,
Delicate, mystical, silvery spray hurling,
Sing I the songs of the world,
The passionate songs of the world.
I sing of laughter and mirth,
And I laugh in a gurgle of glee
As the myriad joys of the earth
Trip through the light with me.
Gay shallows dimple, sparkle and ripple.
Like songs that a lover would sing,
Skipping in moonlight,
Tripping in moonlight,
Whispering echoes of spring.
And again
I move with the slow sadness of pain.
In my dark blue deep, where the shadows creep,
I catch up life’s sorrows and mirror them back again.
And my song is a throbbing, pitiful sobbing,
Choked by an agonized pain.
And then
I move forth toward the beckoning north,
And I sing of the power of men.
As I dash down my falls,
As I beat at my walls
Frantically fighting, running and righting,
All through the flood, through the snarling and biting,
I sing of the power of men,
Of the hurry and power of men.
I am the river of Spavinaw,
I am the giver of pain;
Sadness and gladness must answer my law;
Measure for measure I give, and withdraw
Back through the hills of the Spavinaw,
Hiding away from the plain.","I am the river of Spavinaw, the giver of pain, and the destroyer of joy. I sing of laughter and mirth,                And I laugh in a gurgle of glee                As the myriad joys of the earth                Trip through the light with me.                Gay shallows dimple, sparkle and ripple.                Like songs that a lover would sing,                I sing of the power of men.","'Songs of the Spavinaw' by Ruth Muskrat Bronson describes the powers, abilities, and fears of a river that is at the mercy of humankind. The poem begins with the speaker stating that it is “the river Spavinaw.” It was once in control of the highs and lows of the surrounding areas but now it has been forced to “withdraw” into the hills and away from the plain. It once provoked happiness in those around it and was described with such words as “dimple, sparkle and ripple.” This time has passed and now it is forced to contend with a new world. It retreats to the “north” but even here it must fight."
318,"I discovered these men driving a new pile into the pier.
There was all the paraphernalia
of chains, pulleys, cranes, ropes and, as I said,
a wooden pile, a massive affair, swinging

over the water on a long wire hawser.
Everything else was in the massive style
as well, even the men; very powerful men;
very ruminative and silent men ignoring me.

Speech was not something to interest them,
and if they talked at all it was like this –
“Let go”, or “Hold tight”: all monosyllables.
Nevertheless, by paying close attention
to the obscure movements of one working
on a ladder by the water’s edge, I could tell
that for all their strength and experience
these men were up against a great difficulty.

I cannot say what. Every one of the monsters
was silent on the subject – baffled I thought
at first, but then I realised indifferent
and tired of the whole business.

The man nearest to me, still saying nothing
but crossing his strong arms over his chest,
showed me that for all he cared the pile
could go on swinging until the crack of Doom.

I should say I watched them at least an hour
and, to do the men justice, their slow efforts
to overcome the secret problem did continue –
then gradually slackened and finally ceased.

One massive man after another abandoned
his position and leaned on the iron rail
to gaze down like a mystic into the water.
No one spoke; no one said what they saw;



though one fellow did spit, and with round eyes
followed the trajectory of his brown bolus
(he had been chewing tobacco)
on its slow descent into the same depths.

The foreman, and the most original thinker,
smoked a cigarette to relieve the tension.
Afterwards, and with a heavy kind of majesty,
he turned on his heels and walked away.

With this eclipse of interest, the incident
was suddenly closed. First in ones and twos,
then altogether, the men followed. That left
the pile still in mid-air, and me of course.","I discovered these men driving a new pile into the pier. Every one of the monsters                was silent on the subject – baffled I thought at first, but then I realised indifferent and tired of the whole business. One massive man after another abandoned his position and leaned on the iron rail to gaze down like a mystic into the water.",'From the Journal of a Disappointed Man' by Andrew Motion describes the actions of construction workers who labor to build a pier. The poem takes the reader through the narrator's initial impression of the men and then how that impression evolves as he studies them. He admits his fascination with their actions and minds and eventually comes to different conclusions about their inner lives and the dynamic between them and the rest of the world.
319,"Between plunging valleys, on a bareback of hill
Men in bunting colours
Bounced, and their blown ball bounced.

The blown ball jumped, and the merry-coloured men
Spouted like water to head it.
The ball blew away downwind –

The rubbery men bounced after it.
The ball jumped up and out and hung in the wind
Over a gulf of treetops.
Then they all shouted together, and the blown ball blew back.
Winds from fiery holes in heaven
Piled the hills darkening around them
To awe them. The glare light
Mixed its mad oils and threw glooms.
Then the rain lowered a steel press.

Hair plastered, they all just trod water
To puddle glitter. And their shouts bobbed up
Coming fine and thin, washed and happy

While the humped world sank foundering
And the valleys blued unthinkable
Under the depth of Atlantic depression –

But the wingers leapt, they bicycled in air
And the goalie flew horizontal

And once again a golden holocaust
Lifted the cloud’s edge, to watch them.","Between plunging valleys, on a bareback of hill men in bunting colours                Bounced, and their blown ball bounced.                The blown ball jumped, and the merry-coloured men                Spouted like water to head it.                 The ball blew away downwind –                The rubbery men bounced after it.","'Football at Slack' by Ted Hughes presents a few men who were playing football on a hill and how they enjoyed the sudden appearance of rain. 'Football at Slack' by Ted Hughes presents a beautiful image of a hill and a few men playing football there. In the poem, during the match suddenly the football went down the hill and got stuck on a tree. Those men gathered there and shouted at the ball. But it rolled down in the valley. During this moment, clouds covered the sky and it started raining. The splash of rain made them forget about the ball. Therefore, they started to enjoy the moment. At the end of the poem, the rain stopped and the sun appeared in the sky again like a “golden holocaust”."
320,"Your smiling, or the hope, the thought of it,
Makes in my mind such pause and abrupt ease
As when the highway bridgegates fall,
Balking the hasty traffic, which must sit
On each side massed and staring, while
Deliberately the drawbridge starts to rise:
The horns are hushed, the oilsmoke rarefies,
Above the idling motors one can tell
The packet's smooth approach, the slip,
Slip of the silken river past the sides,
The ringing of clear bells, the dip
And slow cascading of the paddle wheel.","Your smiling, or the hope, the thought of it, makes in my mind such pause and abrupt ease. The horns are hushed, the oilsmoke rarefies, above the idling motors one can tell. The packet's smooth approach, the slip, the ringing of clear bells, the dip. And slow cascading of the paddle wheel.","In 'A Simile for Her Smile,' Wilbur admires the smile of his lover by comparing it to the “idling motors” near highway bridge gates. In this poem, the speaker talks about how the thought of his lover's smile alone, or even the hope that she is smiling, is enough to put his mind at ease. He uses the words “pause” and “abrupt ease” to convey his mental state while thinking about her pleasant, smiling face. No matter what he thinks at the moment, the thought of her smile brightens him up. In the rest of the poem, Wilbur describes traffic halting near bridge gates. The scene is frustrating yet tranquil. Wilbur's use of soothing terms sets a calming tone in the entire text, exuding the pleasure of watching his beloved smile."
321,"I am lazy, the laziest
girl in the world. I sleep during
the day when I want to, 'til
my face is creased and swollen,
'til my lips are dry and hot. I 
eat as I please: cookies and milk
after lunch, butter and sour cream
on my baked potato, foods that
slothful people eat, that turn
yellow and opaque beneath the skin.
Sometimes come dinnertime Sunday
I am still in my nightgown, the one
with the lace trim listing because
I have not mended it. Many days
I do not exercise, only
consider it, then rub my curdy
belly and lie down. Even
my poems are lazy. I use
syllabics instead of iambs,
prefer slant to the gong of full rhyme,
write briefly while others go
for pages. And yesterday,
for example, I did not work at all!
I got in my car and I drove 
to factory outlet stores, purchased
stockings and panties and socks
with my father's money.

To think, in childhood I missed only
one day of school per year. I went
to ballet class four days a week
at four-forty-five and on
Saturdays, beginning always
with plie, ending with curtsy.
To think, I knew only industry,
the industry of my race
and of immigrants, the radio
tuned always to the station
that said, Line up your summer
job months in advance. Work hard
and do not shame your family,
who worked hard to give you what you have.
There is no sin but sloth. Burn
to a wick and keep moving.

I avoided sleep for years,
up at night replaying 
evening news stories about
nearby jailbreaks, fat people
who ate fried chicken and woke up
dead. In sleep I am looking
for poems in the shape of open
V's of birds flying in formation,
or open arms saying, I forgive you, all.","I am lazy, the laziest girl in the world. I sleep during the day when I want to, 'til my face is creased and swollen.

Alexander begins the poem in the present tense with the scene of the trial of four white policemen who brutally beat Rodney King without caring about his civil rights. There were two black men (one King himself and another might be his lawyer) trying to convince the bench of white men that the event, indeed, is in strict violation of civil rights. Then the speaker talks about a separate event at her office where she convinces her boss not to use the word “niggardly” in front of her again. Though this word is tied with the etymology of “nigger” or “negroes”, she somehow feels offended for the resonance of the double “g” sound. Just after the event, she dreams of another scene, where she finds herself in a rodent-filled office that makes her not only feel offended but a bit scared. Her boss advises her to keep her space clean in order to keep these vermin away. In the next lines, Alexander keeps readers engaged in the main subject of the poem that whether the police's actions can be justified. Alongside that, she asks, can African Americans really get along if such events keep occurring in the United States?"
322,"When I was one-and-twenty
I heard a wise man say,
“Give crowns and pounds and guineas
But not your heart away;
Give pearls away and rubies
But keep your fancy free.”
But I was one-and-twenty,
No use to talk to me.
When I was one-and-twenty
I heard him say again,
“The heart out of the bosom
Was never given in vain;
’Tis paid with sighs a plenty
And sold for endless rue.”
And I am two-and-twenty,
And oh, ’tis true, ’tis true.","When I was one-and-twenty, I heard a wise man say, “Give crowns and pounds and guineas, but not your heart away” And I am two- and-a-half, and I hear him say again: “The heart out of the bosom was never given in vain; never paid with sighs a plenty.”","When I Was One-and-Twenty' by A. E. Housman is a moralistic poem that tells of a young man's mistakes in love, despite being given advice. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker describes how when he was 21 years old a wise man gave him some advice. He was told that he would have better luck in love if he gave all his money away first. And surprisingly the speaker did not take the Wiseman out his word and so he did not give away his possessions. But, as the poem concludes, the speaker says that now he's 22 and understands not the man was right."
323,"All things that pass
Are woman's looking-glass;
They show her how her bloom must fade,
And she herself be laid
With withered roses in the shade;
With withered roses and the fallen peach,
Unlovely, out of reach
Of summer joy that was.

All things that pass
Are woman's tiring-glass;
The faded lavender is sweet,
Sweet the dead violet
Culled and laid by and cared for yet;
The dried-up violets and dried lavender
Still sweet, may comfort her,
Nor need she cry Alas!

All things that pass
Are wisdom's looking-glass;
Being full of hope and fear, and still
Brimful of good or ill,
According to our work and will;
For there is nothing new beneath the sun;
Our doings have been done,
And that which shall be was.","All things that pass are woman's looking-glass; they show her how her bloom must fade. The faded lavender is sweet, sweet the dead violet. The dried-up violets and dried lavender are sweet, may comfort her, nor need she cry Alas!","‘Passing And Glassing‘ by Christina Rossetti speaks on a woman’s age and depicts a powerful new way of understanding the process. The poem begins with the speaker stating that the world is used by women as a looking glass. They look out at its innumerable changes and transformations and see their own path through time. When their worlds change, they know that they are changing too. Death is coming closer and soon they will be among the withered flowers on the ground. In the second stanza, the speaker pushes the idea that just because a beautiful thing has been transformed doesn’t mean that it has lost any of its worth. She gives examples of dried lavender and violets. The final stanza explains how womankind need not subscribe to the societal standards of value and beauty. There is much to be gained through age, such as wisdom on “good and ill.” She also expressed the simple fact that nothing happening now is new. Life on earth is born, ages, and then dies. That is how it’s always been and how it always will be."
324,"Beginning my studies, the first step pleas’d me so much,
The mere fact, consciousness—these forms—the power of motion,
The least insect or animal—the senses—eyesight—love;

I have hardly gone, and hardly wish’d to go, any farther,
But stop and loiter all the time, to sing it in extatic songs.","Beginning my studies, the first step pleas’d me so much,                The mere fact, consciousness—these forms—the power of motion,                .

In six lines the poem depicts for the reader the overwhelming joy the speaker felt upon being able to step outside into nature and investigate. He did not have to go farther than the first step before he knew that he was far enough. The connections between creatures, forms, sights, and sounds thrilled him. The last line states that he wanted to sing out his joy in “ecstatic song,” a clear reference to this poem and all the other poetry Whitman wrote on the theme of nature."
325,"This is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign,
Sails the unshadowed main,—
The venturous bark that flings
On the sweet summer wind its purpled wings
In gulfs enchanted, where the Siren sings,
And coral reefs lie bare,
Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair.

Its webs of living gauze no more unfurl;
Wrecked is the ship of pearl!
And every chambered cell,
Where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell,
As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell,
Before thee lies revealed,—
Its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed!

Year after year beheld the silent toil
That spread his lustrous coil;
Still, as the spiral grew,
He left the past year’s dwelling for the new,
Stole with soft step its shining archway through,
Built up its idle door,
Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more.

Thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee,
Child of the wandering sea,
Cast from her lap, forlorn!
From thy dead lips a clearer note is born
Than ever Triton blew from wreathèd horn!
While on mine ear it rings,
Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings:—

Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,
As the swift seasons roll!
Leave thy low-vaulted past!
Let each new temple, nobler than the last,
Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,
Till thou at length art free,
Leaving thine outgrown shell by life’s unresting sea!","This is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign, Sails the unshadowed main. He left the past year’s dwelling for the new, stole with soft step its shining archway through. He stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more.","'The Chambered Nautilus' by Oliver Wendell Holmes it's about the nautilus' life and the lessons one can learn from it. In the first stanza of this poem, the speaker describes, in complimentary terms, the struggle that the nautilus engages in as it attempts to construct more perfect compartments within its shell. He speaks about the creature's death, its creation of a new home, and more. As the poem progresses, the speaker addresses the nautilus itself, thanking it for the message it delivers through its existence. The final stanza is addressed to the speaker's soul, asking it to take strength from the nautilus' life and construct evermore perfect structures or improve the speaker's own spirituality and the strength of their soul."
326,"We match paces along the Hill Head Road,
the road to the old churchyard of Errigal Keerogue;
its early cross, a heavy stone hidden in grass.

As we climb, my old Protestant neighbour
signals landmarks along his well trodden path,
some hill or valley celebrated in local myth.

‘Yonder’s Whiskey Hollow,’ he declares,
indicating a line of lunar birches.
We halt to imagine men plotting

against the wind, feeding the fire or
smothering the fumes of an old fashioned worm
while the secret liquid bubbles and clears.

‘And that’s Foxhole Brae under there –’
pointing to the torn face of a quarry.
‘It used to be crawling with them.’

(A red quarry slinks through the heather,
a movement swift as a bird’s, melting as rain,
glimpsed behind a mound, disappears again.)

At Fairy Thorn Height the view fans out,
ruck and rise to where, swathed in mist
& rain, swells the mysterious saddle shape

of Knockmany Hill, its brooding tumulus
opening perspectives beyond our Christian myth.
‘On a clear day you can see far into Monaghan,’

old Eaglesone says, and we exchange sad notes
about the violence plaguing these parts;
last week, a gun battle outside Aughnacloy,

machine-gun fire splintering the wet thords,
two men beaten up near dark Altamuskin,
an attenpt to blow up Omagh Courthouse.

helicopters overhead, hovering locusts.
Heavily booted soldiers probing vehicles, streets,
their strange antennae bristling, like insects.

At his lane’s end, he turns to face me.
‘Tell them down South that old neighbours
can still speak to each other around here’

& gives me his hand, but not not ask me in.
Rain misting my coat, I turn back towards
the main road, where cars whip smartly past

between small farms, fading back into forest.
Soon all our shared landscape will be effaced,
a quick stubble of pine recovering most.","We meet up with an old Protestant neighbour on the Hill Head Road in County Donegal. He takes us along the road to the old churchyard of Errigal Keerogue, a heavy stone hidden in grass. He points out Foxhole Brae under there –‘It used to be crawling with them.’","In 'The Errigal Road,' John Montague explores Irish mythological history while advocating for relationships that go beyond contemporary violence. The poem takes the reader through a series of landmarks around Hill Head Road in Northern Ireland. The speaker and his neighbour are exploring the landscape. Montague's speaker depicts the land's history, and the neighbour explains stories and legends that they both can relate to and appreciate. As the walk comes to an end the neighbour asks that the speaker remember the clear-headed conversation they had and tell others that it's possible."
327,"TWO crownèd Kings, and One that stood alone
With no green weight of laurels round his head,
But with sad eyes as one uncomforted,
And wearied with man's never-ceasing moan
For sins no bleating victim can atone,
And sweet long lips with tears and kisses fed.
Girt was he in a garment black and red,
And at his feet I marked a broken stone
Which sent up lilies, dove-like, to his knees.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he can see two kings and one man without any laurels. It is this person who catches his attention the most. In the following lines, he describes what feelings he gets from this man and the sights which surround his broken tombstone. In the final couplet, it is revealed that the men are the greek playwrights Æschylos, Sophokles, and Euripides. It is Euripides with whom the speaker is so taken. He is deeply interested in the writer's disappointing reception by the public during his lifetime. It is not until after death he is recognized."
328,"I am not yours, not lost in you,
Not lost, although I long to be
Lost as a candle lit at noon,

Oh plunge me deep in love—put out my senses, leave me deaf and blind.","I Am Not Yours' by Sara Teasdale describes the emotions of a speaker who is seeking out a love that does not strive to confine her. The poem begins with the speaker stating that she is seeking out a relationship that allows her to become lost in love. This does not seem to be the situation she is currently in as she states that she is “not yours.” The speaker does not belong to the relationship she is currently in, nor to the person who is her partner. In the next lines, she describes her ideal relationship as being one that allows her to become like a “candle lit at noon.” She will be burning amongst a great plethora of light. The next section of lines are used to remind the listener that she does still care about them. It is not exactly this person's fault she is unhappy—they are still “beautiful and bright.” The poem concludes with the speaker stating that she is ready to give herself to a “deep…love” which takes over her sense and sweeps her away like a “taper in a rushing wind.”"

And the sun said to me: 'There is a way out of this mountain'",Parting at Morning' by Robert Browning is a short poem that describes in clear detail what the speaker experienced after leaving his lover in the morning. The first two lines describe the landscape and the next two what's in store for the speaker and the sun. The sun has a path of golden light set ou before it while the speaker wants to and needs to go back to the world of men. There is more for him to do in life than spend time with this lover and at this moment this appears to be something he's glad about.
330,"On an evening, for example, when the naive tourist has retired
from our economic horrors, a master's hand awakens
the meadow's harpsichord;
they are playing cards at the bottom of the pond,
mirror conjuring up favorites and queens;
there are saints, veils, threads of harmony,
and legendary chromatics in the setting sun.
He shudders as the hunts and hordes go by.
Comedy drips on the grass stages.
And the distress of the poor and of the weak
on those stupid planes! Before his slave's vision,
Germany goes scaffolding toward moons;
Tartar deserts light up; ancient revolts ferment
in the center of the Celestial Empire;
over stairways and armchairs of rock, a little world, wan and flat,
Africa and Occidents, will be erected.
Then a ballet of familiar seas and nights,
worthless chemistry and impossible melodies. The same bourgeois magic
wherever the mail-train sets you down.
Even the most elementary physicist feels that it is no longer possible
to submit to this personal atmosphere, fog of physical remorse,
which to acknowledge is already an affliction. No!
The moment of the seething cauldron, of seas removed,
of subterranean conflagrations, of the planet swept away,
and the consequent exterminations, certitudes indicated
with so little malice by the Bible and by the Norns
and for which serious persons should be on the alert","On an evening, for example, when the naive tourist has retired from our economic horrors, a master's hand awakens the meadow's harpsichord. Before his slave's vision, Germany goes scaffolding toward moons; ancient revolts ferment in the center of the Celestial Empire.","First Paragraph In whatever evening, for instance, the simple tourist retiring from our economic horrors finds himself, the hand of a master wakes the harpsichord of meadows; cards are played in the depths of the pond, mirror, evoker of queens and favourites; there are saints, sails, and threads of harmony, and legendary chromaticism in the sunset. This first paragraph presents an extensive sentence. The opening of Historic Evening situates the reader in a particular moment of the day, but with no specification of the date or of the hour in which the actions described take place (“In whatever evening”). The lyrical voice depicts the movements of the “simple tourist”, which are also undetermined, and how he/she wants to escape from “economic horrors”. This figure, according to the lyrical voice, is able to discover several things which are listed in the sentence (“the hand of a master wakes the harpsichord of meadows; cards are okayed in the depths of the pond […] evoker of queens and favorites; there are saints, sails, and threads of harmony, and legendary chromaticism in the sunset”). These descriptions use greatly evocative words and build strong natural images, such as that of the pond and of the sunset. Thus, this first paragraph establishes this figure's search over things he/she didn't explore before. Second Paragraph He shudders at the passing of the hunts and the hordes. Drama drips on the platforms of turf. And the superfluity of the poor and the weak on these stupid levels! This second paragraph continues the description of the exploration of the “simple tourist”. The “simple tourist” seems to fear “the hunts and the hordes”. On the next sentences, the lyrical voice will continue to use highly evocative language, as in the first paragraph. The “simple tourist” is still discovering things in this “whatever evening”. Notice the last sentence, and how this is a comment from the lyrical voice towards the understanding of the poor, the weak, and this “simple tourist”. Third Paragraph To his slave's eye, Germany towers upwards toward moons; Tartar deserts light up; ancient revolts foment at the heart of the Celestial Empire; along the stairways and armchairs of rocks a little world, pale and flat, is to be built. Then a ballet of known seas and nights; chemistry without virtue, and impossible melodies. This third paragraph focuses on strong images that appear to the “simple tourist”. This figure sees a vision of the world and how it works. The figure, with his “slave's eye” and “retiring from economic horrors”, sees diverse groups of people. The construction of the first sentence is similar to that of the first paragraph: the figure is mentioned in a certain circumstance and there is an enumeration of the visions he/she has. Notice that the words are greatly evocative and they build strong imagery that continues with the theme used in the previous paragraphs. Fourth Paragraph The same bourgeois magic wherever the packet-boat deposits us! The most elementary physicist feels it is no longer to possible to submit oneself to this personal atmosphere, this fog of physical remorse, observation of which is already an affliction. The fourth paragraph, rather than describing the actions of the figure mentioned, focuses on the lyrical voice. The lyrical voice appears to be making a statement about the historical and cultural context that surrounds both him/her and the figure described (the “simple tourist”). Historic Evening changes its tone and abandons the lyrical descriptions that were made in the previous paragraphs. According to the lyrical voice, it is impossible to escape from the “bourgeois magic” no matter where you go (“wherever the packet-boat deposits us!”). Furthermore, the following sentence describes this feeling of entrapment that the lyrical voice expresses in the first part of the paragraph. Fifth Paragraph No! The moment of the steam room, of evaporating seas, of subterranean conflagrations, of the wandering planet and the consequent exterminations, certainties indicated with so little malice by the Bible and the Norns which it will fall to the serious being to witness – However it will be no matter of legend! The last paragraph expands the message already stated in the fourth paragraph. The lyrical voice continues talking about the “bourgeois magic” and the inability to escape from it (“The moment of the steam room, of evaporating seas, of subterranean conflagrations, of the wandering planet and the consequent exterminations”). The feeling towards the present is reflected in the lyrical voice's description and in the immersion made in the pattern of the elements mentioned. The poem finishes with a strong statement made by the lyrical voice (“However it will be no matter of legend!”). This sentence shows the lyrical voice's reflection on bourgeois life and capitalism. Furthermore, this particular historical moment, according to the lyrical voice, “will be no matter of legend!” opposing his/her present to a much yearned past time."
331,"I come to interview a Voiceless ghost;
Whither, O whither will its whim now draw me?
Up the cliff, down, till I'm lonely, lost,
And the unseen waters' soliloquies awe me.
Where you will next be there's no knowing,
Facing round about me everywhere,
With your nut-coloured hair,
And gray eyes, and rose-flush coming and going.
Yes: I have re-entered your olden haunts at last;
Through the years, through the dead scenes I have tracked you;
What have you now found to say of our past —
Viewed across the dark space wherein I have lacked you?
Summer gave us sweets, but autumn wrought division?
Things were not lastly as firstly well
With us twain, you tell?
But all's closed now, despite Time's derision.
I see what you are doing: you are leading me on
To the spots we knew when we haunted here together,
The waterfall, above which the mist-bow shone
At the then fair hour in the then fair weather,
And the cave just under, with a voice still so hollow
That it seems to call out to me from forty years ago,
When you were all aglow,
And not the thin ghost that I now frailly follow!
Ignorant of what there is flitting here to see,
The waked birds preen and the seals flop lazily,
Soon you will have, Dear, to vanish from me,
For the stars close their shutters and the dawn whitens hazily.
Trust me, I mind not, though Life lours,
The bringing of me here; nay, bring me here again!
I am just the same as when
Our days were a joy, and our paths through flowers.","I come to interview a Voiceless ghost;Whither will its whim now draw me?Up the cliff, down, till I'm lonely, lost, and the unseen waters' soliloquies awe me.Where you will next be there's no knowing, with your nut-coloured hair, and gray eyes, and rose-flush coming and going.","'After a Journey' by Thomas Hardy tells of a speaker's semi-successful attempts to catch and interview the ghost of his dead lover. The poem begins with the speaker telling the listener, who is the ghost, that he has come to interview her. He knows that she is “Voiceless” but they are able to communicate in other ways. In the first stanza, he describes how much work it took to track the ghost down. She is always leading him off to various locations. Many of these remind him of how lonely he is now. When they do eventually come back together it is in one or more of the places they spent time together when she was alive. The speaker is deeply moved by the familiar sights and sounds. His whole life is improved by the evening and night he's able to spend with her. She has to go when the sun rises, but he doesn't mind. He believes that she will be able to bring him back to the same areas again. They don't have to be apart for the rest of the time. It is possible to have temporary moments that return them to the past. Read more of Thomas Hardy's poetry."
332,"Love came down at Christmas,
Love all lovely, love divine;
Love was born at Christmas,
Star and angels gave the sign.

Worship we the Godhead,
Love incarnate, love divine;
Worship we our Jesus:
But wherewith for sacred sign?

Love shall be our token,
Love shall be yours and love be mine,
Love to God and to all men,
Love for plea and gift and sign.","Love came down at Christmas,                Love all lovely, love divine;                Love was born at Christmas.                Star and angels gave the sign.                Love to God and to all men,                 love for plea and gift and sign.              “Love shall be yours and love be mine’","'Love Came Down at Christmas' by Christina Rossetti is a religious Christmas poem that since its publication has become a popular Christmas carol. The poem describes “love,” Jesus Christ, coming down from heaven on Christmas. This “love” is on earth for all of humankind to feel and learn from. All those who subscribe to Christianity, and all those who do not, are part of it. Rossetti depicts “love” as “incarnate,” made flesh in a human body. Jesus is the embodiment of divine love and she sought to celebrate that fact through this short and memorable poem."
333,"Untitled Poem, by George Henry Boker
Blood, blood! The lines of every printed sheet
Through their dark arteries reek with running gore;
At hearth, at board, before the household door,
'T is the sole subject with which neighbors meet.
Girls at the feast, and children in the street,
Prattle of horrors; flash their little store
Of simple jests against the cannon's roar,
As if mere slaughter kept existence sweet.
O, heaven, I quail at the familiar way
This fool, the world, disports his jingling cap;
Murdering or dying with one grin agap!
Our very Love comes draggled from the fray,
Smiling at victory, scowling at mishap,
With gory Death companioned and at play.","Untitled Poem, by George Henry Boker is written in the form of a sonnet. The lines of every printed sheet reek with running gore, says Boker. Boker: ""O, heaven, I quail at the familiar way this fool, the world, disports his jingling cap""","This untitled poem by Boker reveals the horrors of the American Civil War, and the aftermath of these horrors. It also reveals the strength of the American people, to hold on to love even in the midst of death and horror and gore. Boker reveals the different ways in which people responded to the war, and he praised those who held on to their humanity in the midst of so much agony. These words paint a picture for the readers of the horrible imagery of war at the doorstep of home. It reveals the way that it changed people and the painful loss that came with it. The ending of the poem suggests that even though Love survived the way, it was accompanied by Death, and the American people, though they pulled through, would never be the same."
334,"When I have fears that I may cease to be
Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain,
Before high-pilèd books, in charactery,
Hold like rich garners the full ripened grain;
When I behold, upon the night’s starred face,
Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,
And think that I may never live to trace
Their shadows with the magic hand of chance;
And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,
That I shall never look upon thee more,
Never have relish in the faery power
Of unreflecting love—then on the shore
Of the wide world I stand alone, and think
Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.","When I have fears that I may cease to be be beheld, I think of the stars. And when I feel, fair creature of an hour, that I shall never look upon thee more, then on the shore of the wide world I stand alone, and thinkUntil love and fame to nothingness do sink.","This poem was written in 1818, only a few short years before Keats' own death. It is primarily a poem about Keats' fear of mortality, however in true Keatsian fashion, death is also the solution for more of what ails Keats. It would be prudent to remember that Keats' poems have all, in some way, featured death; death of nature, death of love, death of memory, but death all in all. There are few poems, in fact, that does not reference the ending of things. 'When I have Fears that I may Cease to Be' is effusive with imagery, sensual in its description of the fears that Keats possesses, and short. Keats runs the gamut from worrying about dying before he is famous, worrying about the death of his beloved, and then deciding that death itself is not such a terrible situation."
335,"I am Marilyn Mei Ling Chin
Oh, how I love the resoluteness
of that first person singular
followed by that stalwart indicative
of “be,” without the uncertain i-n-g
of “becoming.” Of course,
the name had been changed
somewhere between Angel Island and the sea,
when my father the paperson
in the late 1950s
obsessed with a bombshell blond
transliterated “Mei Ling” to “Marilyn.”
And nobody dared question
his initial impulse—for we all know
lust drove men to greatness,
not goodness, not decency.
And there I was, a wayward pink baby,
named after some tragic white woman
swollen with gin and Nembutal.
My mother couldn't pronounce the “r.”
She dubbed me “Numba one female offshoot”
for brevity: henceforth, she will live and die
in sublime ignorance, flanked
by loving children and the “kitchen deity.”
While my father dithers,
a tomcat in Hong Kong trash—
a gambler, a petty thug,
who bought a chain of chopsuey joints
in Piss River, Oregon,
with bootlegged Gucci cash.
Nobody dared question his integrity given
his nice, devout daughters
and his bright, industrious sons
as if filial piety were the standard
by which all earthly men are measured.
*
Oh, how trustworthy our daughters,
how thrifty our sons!
How we've managed to fool the experts
in education, statistic and demography—
We're not very creative but not adverse to rote-learning.
Indeed, they can use us.
But the “Model Minority” is a tease.
We know you are watching now,
so we refuse to give you any!
Oh, bamboo shoots, bamboo shoots!
The further west we go, we'll hit east;
the deeper down we dig, we'll find China.
History has turned its stomach
on a black polluted beach—
where life doesn't hinge
on that red, red wheelbarrow,
but whether or not our new lover
in the final episode of “Santa Barbara”
will lean over a scented candle
and call us a “bitch.”
Oh God, where have we gone wrong?
We have no inner resources!

Then, one redolent spring morning
the Great Patriarch Chin
peered down from his kiosk in heaven
and saw that his descendants were ugly.
One had a squarish head and a nose without a bridge
Another's profile—long and knobbed as a gourd.
A third, the sad, brutish one
may never, never marry.
And I, his least favorite—
“not quite boiled, not quite cooked,”
a plump pomfret simmering in my juices—
too listless to fight for my people's destiny.
“To kill without resistance is not slaughter”
says the proverb. So, I wait for imminent death.
The fact that this death is also metaphorical
is testament to my lethargy.

So here lies Marilyn Mei Ling Chin,
married once, twice to so-and-so, a Lee and a Wong,
granddaughter of Jack “the patriarch”
and the brooding Suilin Fong,
daughter of the virtuous Yuet Kuen Wong
and G.G. Chin the infamous,
sister of a dozen, cousin of a million,
survived by everybody and forgotten by all.
She was neither black nor white,
neither cherished nor vanquished,
just another squatter in her own bamboo grove
minding her poetry—
when one day heaven was unmerciful,
and a chasm opened where she stood.
Like the jowls of a mighty white whale,
or the jaws of a metaphysical Godzilla,
it swallowed her whole.
She did not flinch nor writhe,
nor fret about the afterlife,
but stayed! Solid as wood, happily
a little gnawed, tattered, mesmerized
by all that was lavished upon her
and all that was taken away!","Marilyn Mei Ling Chin is the daughter of G.G. Chin and the granddaughter of Jack ""the patriarch"" Chin. Her father was a gambler, a petty thug, who bought a chain of chopsuey joints with Gucci cash. Her mother dubbed her “Numba one female offshoot” for brevity.","'How I Got That Name' by Marilyn Chin is a complex poem about the poet's heritage, name, and cultural identity. Chin spends the poem addressing her life as a Chinese-American immigrant, brought to America when she was young. She notes how her father changed her name at the beginning of the poem, attempting to Americanize it. At the same time, she also discusses her father's personality and the dishonest way that he made his money. Throughout, she tries to explain how difficult it was growing up in two different worlds and trying to get the approval of both. The poet also depicts how she believes her ancestors judge her while also trying to judge herself more fairly."

They washed me out of the turret with a hose. When I died they washed me from the turret.,"'The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner' by Randall Jarrell is a moving poem about the death of a soldier during the Second World War. Throughout the lines of this piece, Jarrell's speaker, a deceased soldier, describes his birth and innocence while juxtaposing it with his job as a gunner and death. The first lines describe how he was born from his mother's dream into “the State” or a new, more violent understanding of life. There, he hunkers down inside a new womb, the ball turret. His days are filled with black flak and nightmarish scenes of life and death. The poem's final line reveals that the speaker is dead, and his remains were washed from the “womb” with a hose."

For instance, that fool crow, picking through trash near the corral, understands the center of the world as greasy strips of fat. Just ask him.

Although she has often heard places such as 'New York' being called the centre of the world, for her it is her house. The same applies to different characters explored within the poem, finding different locations that they love and call home. The poem finishes by applying these ideas to animals, with the 'crow' finding its home in food and the sky. "
338,"I have news relayed, and me sinking, falling somewhere
Depths of unfamiliar raw and numb
Lost with colour faded, heart of lead
But news of magnitude with need to tell
Urgent my confidant, share and burden feather light.

I sit with details of coffin silver handles
And flowers that will lie, as body might
Sprawled, cascading, perfume hiding
Truth opaque, below and soon to soil
Hands on shoulder, touch and sighs of lengthy sorrow.
​
Mountainous recount, the awfulness
Of finding not life, but still shape
On carpet red, and we required to stand back
And interpret all, life art, as sculpture
Not final line of stroke, silence beating rhythm.
​
I want the sun to sink low, rays that bow to this
As does the blackness of night
Engulf me, sundial of death shadow
Waves to roar with tidal tears and clouds to cry
Drenching us, we, cycle on repeat.
​
Soon ripples fade, ash as grains no movement make
Dry face with sobbing heart and line of smile
As appropriate, but not for where you are
Where are you, my friend with need to tell
I lie on ground to share one beating heart.
​
So much to tell with service black, and black was
Tea and biscuits after, for words too hard for some
I dial your number, fingers weary
And silence greets with nothing
Is that it my brother? Is end so blatant neat?
​
If I found you, essence stretching infinite vast
And shining star that mocks all logic
I doubt such concept can reason, should reason
Such fantasy as comfort
Given things considered, now and after.
​
So much to speak, but turn I did, and words were ready
Finding only void and black
Of anguish, sorrow, hurt and pain exquisite
Where did you go brother love and what are you?
I sit in silence, you as quiet fading, confidant gone.

Cavendish is a powerful poem written in the wake of an important loss. The speaker spends the first stanza of the poem describing their reaction to a piece of news, someone they care deeply for has passed away. This person, who goes unnamed and mostly undescribed throughout the poem was incredibly close to them. They're surrounded by a new emptiness that makes them feel both raw and numb. The funeral occurs, and the speaker considers the nature of death and the rituals surrounding burying someone. After the person is gone, and an amount of time has passed, the speaker still finds themselves moved by the loss. They go to their lost loved one's grave and lie on the ground, as close to this person as they can be. The poem concludes with a final image of loss and darkness as the speaker contends with the new silence in their life."
339,"Some day, when trees have shed their leaves
And against the morning’s white
The shivering birds beneath the eaves
Have sheltered for the night,
We’ll turn our faces southward, love,
Toward the summer isle
Where bamboos spire the shafted grove
And wide-mouthed orchids smile.
And we will seek the quiet hill
Where towers the cotton tree,
And leaps the laughing crystal rill,
And works the droning bee.
And we will build a cottage there
Beside an open glade,
With black-ribbed blue-bells blowing near,
And ferns that never fade.","Some day, when trees have shed their leaves, when birds beneath the eaves have sheltered for the night, we’ll turn our faces southward, love.

The speaker spends the first stanza initiating his dream and suggesting that when winter is over, they're going to be able to “turn” their faces toward the summer isle and forget about the cold, inhospitable past. When they go towards the summer isle, they'll find peace. There will be everything that one could hope to find in the natural world. This includes rivers, flowers, cotton trees, and more. The poet uses personification to depict these scenes as well as good examples of imagery."

341,"As I went down to Dymchurch Wall,
I heard the South sing o'er the land
I saw the yellow sunlight fall
On knolls where Norman churches stand.

And ringing shrilly, taut and lithe,
Within the wind a core of sound,
The wire from Romney town to Hythe
Along its airy journey wound.

A veil of purple vapour flowed
And trailed its fringe along the Straits;
The upper air like sapphire glowed:
And roses filled Heaven's central gates.


Masts in the offing wagged their tops;
The swinging waves pealed on the shore;
The saffron beach, all diamond drops
And beads of surge, prolonged the roar.

As I came up from Dymchurch Wall,
I saw above the Downs' low crest
The crimson brands of sunset fall,
Flicker and fade from out the West.

Night sank: like flakes of silver fire
The stars in one great shower came down;
Shrill blew the wind; and shrill the wire
Rang out from Hythe to Romney town.

The darkly shining salt sea drops
Streamed as the waves clashed on the shore;
The beach, with all its organ stops
Pealing again, prolonged the roar.","As I went down to Dymchurch Wall, I heard the South sing o'er the land. I saw the yellow sunlight fall on knolls where Norman churches stand. The swinging waves pealed on the shore; the saffron beach, all diamond drops, prolonged the roar.","In Romney Marsh is a landscape poem written at a time where landscape poems were considered to be a little bit out of fashion – in most areas, Romanticism had already faded, lending the poem itself a dated feel to it; although it was written much later than 1857, it still feels like a Romantic poem, and therefore feels like it should have been written much earlier. In the poem, the poet describes, in great and loving detail, his love for the place Romney Marsh, with a particular reverence given to the beauty and the placement of Romney Marsh, and with a familiarity that makes the poem read almost like a love poem. Wordsworth is still, perhaps, the better-known landscape poet, the one who has written ditties to nature and particularly to man's influence on nature, but a Wordsworthian poem is always slightly removed from the reality of the situation. In Romney Marsh does not have this problem: the love the poet has for it is a visible and obvious love that lasts despite the place's flaws, and influence on other things. It is particularly important to read knowing that it is still an area of beauty that exists, and is safeguarded by the British government, though its purpose has changed ever since the switch from sheep farming to arable production. That being said, a lot of British landscape poems betray a familiarity to the area that is almost loving, and this is certainly true of Romney Marsh. It is easy to believe that he has grown up there, despite the fact that John Davidson is a Scottish poet."
342,"Why is there no monument
To Porridge in our land?

In the first lines of 'Porridge', the speaker begins by asking why porridge, such an important food to the British people, does not have a monument.

Through the next lines, the speaker tries to outline why porridge deserves a monument and then envisions what that monument would look like after completion. He thinks it should be on a plinth in London, but that the “Porridge” should be made in Scotland."

She's not going to pick them, but she is going to touch them. She'll savor the moment while it's occurring but not do anything to persevere it longer than it naturally lasts.

344,"Myself I'm like a dress my mother made
me, a fabric self split open with a sigh
as I grew and—bewildered or proud
 
or full of rage—patched with nicer
material than we'd had before. I got
the sense it was all wasted on me.
 
But a needle's sharp to pierce, is itself
pierced—so as to sew like I was taught.
Like I learned: no dress could ever be
 
beautiful or best if it had me in it.
I was the stain in a place we couldn't fix.
Having fallen on a slicer of some kind.
 
Double-seamed, scabbed over, a new body
pocket in the pattern. How to stitch up
that wound right into the clean vertical rip
 
in some on-sale flannelette?
I'd never again be cold. Skin's holey not holy.
In mad winter alone with drink, I think:
 
tattoo needles don't use thread but ink
to mark a place in this ever-moving skin
and that wound is ornament. But who
 
needs a mark to know what's marked?
I would pray to the dark in the dark.
But what did I ask for, what did I know
 
to ask for? Nonfatal wounds: they're there
when we die, deliquescent, vibrating like a drum
skin just after each beat moves off.
 
A part of music. A way a body keeps time,
is time's keeper, vigilant till time up and goes
to find another body. Another's warmth
 
and shelter. Or related injuries. Anyone
who hurts another was hurt that same way,
so how far back behind our backs do we go
 
to finally find the first hurt; whose finger
points to say, ""You! You're the one who god
knows why started a cycle of unending pain,""
 
to someone's child in short pants?
A baby just torn a hole in her amnion swirl?
And what of me? I can't tell where my flesh
 
meets the rest of me, ragbag full of rags,
shot full of holes but that's just the way cotton
and silk and everything I said up till now looks
 
when it hits the air and is cried on. I'm so inside
out I evaporated entirely already as August does,
my actual dress shredded at the seams—
 
unsalvageable. Who would ever love me like this?
And just like that, I stopped thinking about it.
I agree to meet you at the ferry heading to a place
 
neither of us wants to go but both just said
sure, I'll go... if you want! We should turn back,
nobody said. Oh we should before it's too late,
 
nobody said again, insistent this time.","Myself I'm like a dress my mother made me, a fabric self split open with a sigh. No dress could ever be beautiful or best if it had me in it. Nonfatal wounds: they're there when we die, vibrating like a drum.","'Your One Good Dress' by Brenda Shaughnessy is an interesting depiction of how dresses represent one's intentions and attitude. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker goes through all the reasons why one dress or another is the incorrect choice. After dismissing ballroom gowns, red, brown, and olive ones, they land on a black dress as the right choice. It's the only one “you” can wear to a funeral, party, reunion, or when you decide to go missing."

He expresses his wonder at the sight of the colours in the sky. It arched over the sky in a magnificent and awe-inspiring way. He was drawn in to stare at it until it was no longer there. The poet also speaks of the other elements that surround the rainbow–the passing rain and the burning sun. The scene was perfect for its appearance in the sky. The rainbow was a temporary beauty, there one minute and gone the next. He experiences its presence as a brief gift amongst the “solitude” of the wet foliage around him. "
346,"It was my thirtieth year to heaven
Woke to my hearing from harbour and neighbour wood
And the mussel pooled and the heron
Priested shore
The morning beckon
With water praying and call of seagull and rook
And the knock of sailing boats on the net webbed wall
Myself to set foot
That second
In the still sleeping town and set forth.
My birthday began with the water-
Birds and the birds of the winged trees flying my name
Above the farms and the white horses
And I rose
In rainy autumn
And walked abroad in a shower of all my days.
High tide and the heron dived when I took the road
Over the border
And the gates
Of the town closed as the town awoke.
A springful of larks in a rolling
Cloud and the roadside bushes brimming with whistling
Blackbirds and the sun of October
Summery
On the hill's shoulder,
Here were fond climates and sweet singers suddenly
Come in the morning where I wandered and listened
To the rain wringing
Wind blow cold
In the wood faraway under me.
Pale rain over the dwindling harbour
And over the sea wet church the size of a snail
With its horns through mist and the castle
Brown as owls
But all the gardens
Of spring and summer were blooming in the tall tales
Beyond the border and under the lark full cloud.
There could I marvel
My birthday
Away but the weather turned around.
It turned away from the blithe country
And down the other air and the blue altered sky
Streamed again a wonder of summer
With apples
Pears and red currants
And I saw in the turning so clearly a child's
Forgotten mornings when he walked with his mother
Through the parables
Of sun light
And the legends of the green chapels
And the twice told fields of infancy
That his tears burned my cheeks and his heart moved in mine.
These were the woods the river and sea
Where a boy
In the listening
Summertime of the dead whispered the truth of his joy
To the trees and the stones and the fish in the tide.
And the mystery
Sang alive
Still in the water and singingbirds.
And there could I marvel my birthday
Away but the weather turned around. And the true
Joy of the long dead child sang burning
In the sun.
It was my thirtieth
Year to heaven stood there then in the summer noon
Though the town below lay leaved with October blood.
O may my heart's truth
Still be sung

The long dead child sang burning burning in the sun.,"Poem in October' by Dylan Thomas tells of a speaker's journey out of autumn and up a hill to reclaim childhood joy, the summer season, and his spirituality. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he was thirty years old when he wrote this. It was his birthday and he chose to go on a walk. He left his home, traveled alongside the water's edge, listened to the seabirds and the woods. The speaker left the town behind and began a climb up a nearby hill. As he rose the town shrank. At the same time, the season began to change. Autumn, and it's cool air, faded away and the summer returned. The rain continued as he climbed, as did the presence of birds. These two images are crucial to the speaker's understanding of happiness and childhood. When he finally got to the top of the hill it was like he had reached heaven. He was far above the coolness of autumn and he became absorbed with memories of his childhood. The speaker recalled coming to his place with his mother and what it meant to him. He hoped while on the hill that the joy he experienced will last throughout the year. Perhaps he will return to reclaim it when he turns thirty-one."
347,"Crisply the bright snow whispered,
Crunching beneath our feet;
Behind us as we walked along the parkway,
Our shadows danced,
Fantastic shapes in vivid blue.
Across the lake the skaters
Flew to and fro,
With sharp turns weaving
A frail invisible net.
In ecstasy the earth
Drank the silver sunlight;
In ecstasy the skaters
Drank the wine of speed;
In ecstasy we laughed
Drinking the wine of love.
Had not the music of our joy
Sounded its highest note?
But no,
For suddenly, with lifted eyes you said,
“Oh look!”
There, on the black bough of a snow flecked maple,
Fearless and gay as our love,
A bluejay cocked his crest!
Oh who can tell the range of joy
Or set the bounds of beauty?","Crisply the bright snow whispered,Crunching beneath our feet.Behind us as we walked along the parkway,                Our shadows danced,                Fantastic shapes in vivid blue.Across the lake the skaters Flew to and fro,                With sharp turns weaving a frail invisible net.                In ecstasy the earth                Drank the silver sunlight;                                 “Drinking the wine of love”","A Winter Blue Jay' by Sara Teasdale tells of a perfect day in which the speaker and her companion find the pinnacle of their love, and then surpass it. The poem begins by placing the couple in a snow-covered landscape, walking through the “whisper[ing]” snow, enjoying a quiet moment. Their shadows are “danc[ing]” behind them, creating a beautiful pattern of light. It is clear that this moment is not one that comes often. They continue on their walk and come upon skaters on a frozen lake who gracefully, without fault, weave around one another. Their grace and effortless beauty mimic the day and improve upon it still. Finally, the speaker asks if they have reached the “highest point” of their happiness and she decides that they have not as her companion points out a bluejay. The jay is proud of it's own form and fearless in its assertions of life. The bird is like their love is that day, without worry for the future and enjoying the perfect moment the day has brought. The poem concludes with an optimistic statement about happiness. That when one believes they have reached the pinnacle of their life, in which nothing could increase their joy, there may be more around the corner waiting for them."
348,"It will not hurt me when I am old,
A running tide where moonlight burned
Will not sting me like silver snakes;
The years will make me sad and cold,
It is the happy heart that breaks.
The heart asks more than life can give,
When that is learned, then all is learned;
The waves break fold on jewelled fold,
But beauty itself is fugitive,
It will not hurt me when I am old.","It will not hurt me when I am old, says the poet. A running tide where moonlight burned will not sting me like silver snakes. The years will make me sad and cold, but it is the happy heart that breaks. The heart asks more than life can give, then all is learned.","'Moonlight' by Sara Teasdale is a poem about the sorrows of youth and the blissful nature of old age. This lyrical poem starts with the speaker longing for old age. This is because the speaker believes that youth is full of pain and misery. They believe that this pain and misery arises out of happiness, and that they are two sides of the same coin. Old age, on the other hand, is sad and cold by itself, and there is no happiness to speak of. This is why the pain and misery that so affects youth does not have any impact on old age."
349,"The instructor said,
Go home and write
a page tonight.
And let that page come out of you—
Then, it will be true.
I wonder if it’s that simple?
I am twenty-two, colored, born in Winston-Salem. I went to school there, then Durham, then here to this college on the hill above Harlem. I am the only colored student in my class. The steps from the hill lead down into Harlem, through a park, then I cross St. Nicholas, Eighth Avenue, Seventh, and I come to the Y, the Harlem Branch Y, where I take the elevator up to my room, sit down, and write this page:
It’s not easy to know what is true for you or me at twenty-two, my age. But I guess I’m what
I feel and see and hear, Harlem, I hear you:
hear you, hear me—we two—you, me, talk on this page. (I hear New York, too.) Me—who?
Well, I like to eat, sleep, drink, and be in love. I like to work, read, learn, and understand life. I like a pipe for a Christmas present,
or records—Bessie, bop, or Bach.
I guess being colored doesn’t make me not like
the same things other folks like who are other races. So will my page be colored that I write? Being me, it will not be white.
But it will be
a part of you, instructor.
You are white—
yet a part of me, as I am a part of you.
That’s American.
Sometimes perhaps you don’t want to be a part of me. Nor do I often want to be a part of you.
But we are, that’s true!
As I learn from you,
I guess you learn from me—
although you’re older—and white—
and somewhat more free.
This is my page for English B.","The author is a colored student at a New York City college. He writes about his experiences in Harlem. The author says he feels and hears Harlem. He also writes of his relationship with his white instructor, who is also colored. The writer says he learns from his teacher, although he is older and more free.","Theme for English B' by Langston Hughes explores the mind of a young black man, setting out to write an assignment for his English class. The poem describes the assignment, one page of writing, and the speaker's apprehension about completing it. He isn't sure that he's going to be able to simply sit down and write. He is sure that it's more complicated than that. His apprehension turns into success as he mulls over his feelings and explores his personality and heritage. He speaks on his similarities to his classmates and his differences, as well as his relationship with the white instructor."
350,"Happy those early days! when I
Shined in my angel infancy.
Before I understood this place
Appointed for my second race,
Or taught my soul to fancy aught
But a white, celestial thought;
When yet I had not walked above
A mile or two from my first love,
And looking back, at that short space,
Could see a glimpse of His bright face;
When on some gilded cloud or flower
My gazing soul would dwell an hour,
And in those weaker glories spy
Some shadows of eternity;
Before I taught my tongue to wound
My conscience with a sinful sound,
Or had the black art to dispense
A several sin to every sense,
But felt through all this fleshly dress
Bright shoots of everlastingness.
O, how I long to travel back,
And tread again that ancient track!
That I might once more reach that plain
Where first I left my glorious train,
From whence th’ enlightened spirit sees
That shady city of palm trees.
But, ah! my soul with too much stay
Is drunk, and staggers in the way.
Some men a forward motion love;
But I by backward steps would move,
And when this dust falls to the urn,
In that state I came, return.","Happy those early days! when I                Shined in my angel infancy.                Appointed for my second race,                Or taught my soul to fancy aught.                A mile or two from my first love,                Could see a glimpse of His bright face.                When on some gilded cloud or flower my gazing soul would dwell an hour.                In that state I came, return.","'The Retreat' by Henry Vaughan describes a speaker's desire to escape to the past where he was a younger, purer, and generally happier human being. The poem begins with the speaker mourning for the lost days of his childhood. He longs to return to a time when he was in his “angel infancy” and had yet to be influenced by the dark forces of the world. It would be a time in which he had yet to stray far from his home or realize the struggle that would take him over internally. In the present day, he worries about his own emotions and his sinful nature. He is concerned over his own being in a way that was not even considered when he was young. In the final lines, the speaker describes the end of his life and how he will return to the dust of the earth. This will be the penultimate ending for a man who longs for his previous life."
351,"That’s my last Duchess painted on the wall,
Looking as if she were alive. I call
That piece a wonder, now; Fra Pandolf’s hands
Worked busily a day, and there she stands.
Will’t please you sit and look at her? I said
“Fra Pandolf” by design, for never read
Strangers like you that pictured countenance,
The depth and passion of its earnest glance,
But to myself they turned (since none puts by
The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)
And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,
How such a glance came there; so, not the first
Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, ’twas not
Her husband’s presence only, called that spot
Of joy into the Duchess’ cheek; perhaps
Fra Pandolf chanced to say, “Her mantle laps
Over my lady’s wrist too much,” or “Paint
Must never hope to reproduce the faint
Half-flush that dies along her throat.” Such stuff
Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough
For calling up that spot of joy. She had
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad,
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.
Sir, ’twas all one! My favour at her breast,
The dropping of the daylight in the West,
The bough of cherries some officious fool
Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule
She rode with round the terrace—all and each
Would draw from her alike the approving speech,
Or blush, at least. She thanked men—good! but thanked
Somehow—I know not how—as if she ranked
My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name
With anybody’s gift. Who’d stoop to blame
This sort of trifling? Even had you skill
In speech—which I have not—to make your will
Quite clear to such an one, and say, “Just this
Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,
Or there exceed the mark”—and if she let
Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set
Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse—
E’en then would be some stooping; and I choose
Never to stoop. Oh, sir, she smiled, no doubt,
Whene’er I passed her; but who passed without
Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;
Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands
As if alive. Will’t please you rise? We’ll meet
The company below, then. I repeat,
The Count your master’s known munificence
Is ample warrant that no just pretense
Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;
Though his fair daughter’s self, as I avowed
At starting, is my object. Nay, we’ll go
Together down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,
Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,
Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!","That’s my last Duchess painted on the wall, looking as if she were alive. Will’t please you sit and look at her?

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker tells the reader that an emissary is visiting who is trying to negotiate a new marriage for the Duke. He also describes how he was recently married, inspired by a portrait of his late wife. He suggests that she did something he didn't approve of and that her behavior displeased him. Finally, the Duchess died and now the Duke is left to choose a new bride."
352,"Villagers all, this frosty tide,
Let your doors swing open wide,
Though wind may follow, and snow beside,
Yet draw us in by your fire to bide;

Blowing fingers and stamping feet,
Come from far away you to greet —
You by the fire and we in the street —
Bidding you joy in the morning!

Sudden a star has led us on,
Raining bliss and benison —
Bliss tomorrow and more anon,
Joy for every morning!

Saw the star o'er a stable low;
Mary she might not further go —
Welcome thatch, and litter below!

Animals all, as it befell,
In the stable where they did dwell!

The poem is set at night, a few hours before Christ's birth. The poem begins with a request to the villagers to keep their doors open to welcome those who are standing outside in the “frosty tide”. The speaker of the poem depicts their condition. They are standing in the cold and waiting to enter one of the houses. There is a sense of waiting in everyone's tone as something great is going to happen in the morning. Thereafter, the poet quickly shifts to the story of Joseph and Mary. After being tired of walking, they entered into a thatch. It is that holy but lowly stable where Christ was born at the stroke of daybreak on 25th December."
353,"O let the solid ground
Not fail beneath my feet

Then let come what come may,                What matter if I go mad,                I shall have had my day.","O let the solid ground' by Alfred Lord Tennyson is a short pronouncement of a speaker's intention to find love before Heaven takes his life. The poem expresses a speaker's desire to find someone who truly loves him before he loses his life or goes mad. He states that he's willing to endure anything as long as he gets to have the “sweet” experience that others have before him. The tone throughout the poem is concise and determined, helping Tennyson craft a hopeful and at times desperate mood. 'O let the solid ground' speaks on themes of love, the purpose of life, and loss."
354,"Children, I come back today
To tell you a story of the long dark way
That I had to climb, that I had to know
In order that the race might live and grow.
Look at my face - dark as the night -
Yet shining like the sun with love's true light.
I am the dark girl who crossed the red sea
Carrying in my body the seed of the free.
I am the woman who worked in the field
Bringing the cotton and the corn to yield.
I am the one who labored as a slave,
Beaten and mistreated for the work that I gave -
Children sold away from me, I'm husband sold, too.
No safety, no love, no respect was I due.

Three hundred years in the deepest South:
But God put a song and a prayer in my mouth.
God put a dream like steel in my soul.
Now, through my children, I'm reaching the goal.

Now, through my children, young and free,
I realized the blessing deed to me.
I couldn't read then. I couldn't write.
I had nothing, back there in the night.
Sometimes, the valley was filled with tears,
But I kept trudging on through the lonely years.
Sometimes, the road was hot with the sun,
But I had to keep on till my work was done:
I had to keep on! No stopping for me -
I was the seed of the coming Free.
I nourished the dream that nothing could smother
Deep in my breast - the Negro mother.
I had only hope then, but now through you,
Dark ones of today, my dreams must come true:
All you dark children in the world out there,
Remember my sweat, my pain, my despair.
Remember my years, heavy with sorrow -
And make of those years a torch for tomorrow.
Make of my pass a road to the light
Out of the darkness, the ignorance, the night.
Lift high my banner out of the dust.
Stand like free men supporting my trust.
Believe in the right, let none push you back.
Remember the whip and the slaver's track.
Remember how the strong in struggle and strife
Still bar you the way, and deny you life -
But march ever forward, breaking down bars.
Look ever upward at the sun and the stars.
Oh, my dark children, may my dreams and my prayers
Impel you forever up the great stairs -
For I will be with you till no white brother
Dares keep down the children of the Negro Mother.","Children, I come back today to tell you a story of the long dark way. I am the dark girl who crossed the red sea carrying in my body the seed of the free. I nourished the dream that nothing could smotherDeep in my breast - the Negro mother. Through my children, young and free, I realized the blessing deed to me.","For anyone with any knowledge of American history, the title of this poem alone, The Negro Mother, evokes emotion. The African American slaves lived through the worst brutality known to have taken place on American soil. The Negro Mother, although written by Langston Hughes, a man, comes to readers through the voice of a woman and a former slave. She writes to her children, challenging them to pick up the torch and to carry it on, fighting for freedom and equality. Her words paint the image of a strong and passionate black woman who has been abused and mistreated, but who has not succumbed to oppression but has risen above it with a passion in her heart and a song in her mouth. These are the words she wants every black child in America to take to heart."
355,"The scene stands stubborn: skinflint trees

Such poverty. No dead men's cries

Flies watch no resurrections in the sun.

Till your eyes foist a vision dazzling on the wind:

Damned, howling in their shrouds across the moor
Rave on the leash of the starving mind

The poem begins with the speaker stating that the cemetery is full of trees and grasses which are unwilling to shed their summer leaves and colours. They cling desperately and uselessly to their foliage. Just as the plants attempt to maintain life into the winter, so too does humanity seek something after death. The next two stanzas are used to explain, in impassioned detail, that there is nothing magical about the cemetery. It is clear by the end of the poem that the speaker is set in her opinion about the land. She feels it is only relevant for its physical and “essential “parts."
356,"Around and beneath, the dull grey mist and the sullen roar of the sea,
Scant footing-place on the sheer cliffs face—with death for a penalty;
But afar and above there is rest and love, there is hope for brain and hand,
The valleys fair and the crystal air and the peaks of Morning Land.

Around and beneath are the mists of toil and the sullen roar of the world,
And the sneer of scorn for a foothold gone and a climber backward hurled;
But afar and above are the hopes of men with the heart and will to stand
On the thin rift’s edge and the slippery ledge that lead to Morning Land.

They slip and fall from the sheer cliffs face; ah, God! they are falling still!
But another leaps for the vacant place, and another his place will fill.
’Tis little they fear the coward’s sneer, or the scorn of a selfish band,
Whose eyes are set on the parapet and the heights of Morning Land.

Hark to the ring as their rock picks swing, and bite for a foothold there!
Grip by grip they are straining up that others may travel fair.
The world will follow them all some day, the men it has shunned and banned,
The gallant hearts that hewed the way that leads to Morning Land.","Around and beneath are the mists of toil and the sullen roar of the world, and the sneer of scorn for a foothold gone and a climber backward hurled.

This piece begins by describing the world that the men in the poem are going to be attempting to leave. The world is “dull grey mist” and the “sullen roar of the sea.” There is nothing there but the reminders of all the tragedies and failures of the past. All are seeking to rise above it. Also described is, “Morning Land.” A metaphorical utopia that is the breeding ground for “rest and love” and “hope for brain and hand.” This world represents the grass that is always greener on the other side and the human desire to improve one's circumstances. The poem continues and the reader gets additional detail about how difficult this climb up the mountainside is. Many fall to their deaths, only to be replaced by others just as eager. No one is deterred by critics and cowards, they climb onward. Additionally, these men climbing are forging a path for others to follow so that all may reach this utopia out of the reach of strife."
357,"O! never say that I was false of heart,
Though absence seemed my flame to qualify.
As easy might I from myself depart
As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:

Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
So that myself bring water for my stain.
Never believe, though in my nature reigned

To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;
For nothing this wide universe I call,
Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.","O! never say that I was false of heart, though absence seemed my flame to qualify. As easy might I from myself depart from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie.

In the first lines of 'Sonnet 109,' the speaker begins by trying to remind the youth, and anyone listening, that his love for the former has never cooled. Even if the two are separated, he knows that nothing could temper the love he has for this young man. He compares himself through a simile to a traveler who always comes home. His nature is not that which would allow him to abandon the Youth for any other pleasures. Because he concludes, there is nothing else in the world worth loving for spending time on."
358,"The water understands
Civilization well;

It chills my life, but wittily,
It is not disconcerted,

Ill used, it will destroy,

The poem depicts water as a personified element that has learned, through its long life, how to navigate the world. It knows civilization well. Water is at once “witty” and “pretty.” It blesses those who use it well and treats poorly those who misuse it."

In the first lines, the speaker begins by using an extended metaphor to describe a natural scene. She speaks about the reaction of animals when “great trees fall”. They hide, hunker down, and “lumber after safety”. The metaphor compares the death of loved ones to the monumental shifts that occur when large and powerful trees fall in the forest. As the poem progresses she moves on to directly speak about “great souls” and how human beings react to loss. The third stanza discusses one's inability to breathe and the sharpening one's memory undergoes. The poem concludes with a message of hope and renewal, suggesting that after a loved one's death that “We can be…better. For they existed”."
360,"There had been years of Passion—scorching, cold,
And much Despair, and Anger heaving high,
Care whitely watching, Sorrows manifold,
Among the young, among the weak and old,
And the pensive Spirit of Pity whispered, “Why?”
 
 
Men had not paused to answer. Foes distraught
Pierced the thinned peoples in a brute-like blindness,
Philosophies that sages long had taught,
And Selflessness, were as an unknown thought,
And “Hell!” and “Shell!” were yapped at Lovingkindness.
 
 
The feeble folk at home had grown full-used
To 'dug-outs', 'snipers', 'Huns', from the war-adept
In the mornings heard, and at evetides perused;
To day-dreamt men in millions, when they mused—
To nightmare-men in millions when they slept.
 
 
Waking to wish existence timeless, null,
Sirius they watched above where armies fell;
He seemed to check his flapping when, in the lull
Of night a boom came thencewise, like the dull
Plunge of a stone dropped into some deep well.
 
 
So, when old hopes that earth was bettering slowly
Were dead and damned, there sounded 'War is done!'
One morrow. Said the bereft, and meek, and lowly,
'Will men some day be given to grace? yea, wholly,
And in good sooth, as our dreams used to run?'
 
 
Breathless they paused. Out there men raised their glance
To where had stood those poplars lank and lopped,
As they had raised it through the four years’ dance
Of Death in the now familiar flats of France;
And murmured, 'Strange, this! How? All firing stopped?'
 
 
Aye; all was hushed. The about-to-fire fired not,
The aimed-at moved away in trance-lipped song.
One checkless regiment slung a clinching shot
And turned. The Spirit of Irony smirked out, 'What?
Spoil peradventures woven of Rage and Wrong?'
 
 
Thenceforth no flying fires inflamed the gray,
No hurtlings shook the dewdrop from the thorn,
No moan perplexed the mute bird on the spray;
Worn horses mused: 'We are not whipped to-day;'
No weft-winged engines blurred the moon’s thin horn.
 
 
Calm fell. From Heaven distilled a clemency;
There was peace on earth, and silence in the sky;
Some could, some could not, shake off misery:
The Sinister Spirit sneered: 'It had to be!'

The poem begins with the speaker describing all the years of emotion which have impacted the peoples of the world. There has been much anger, fury, despair and passion amongst those fighting and those “feeble folk” who are at home but still immersed in the war. No one has been able to escape it. The men on the battlefields have truly suffered, so much so that when the war is declared over, no one can quite believe it. The speaker describes the men walking away from their posts and marveling at the silence that surrounds them. The calm brings with it a new hope the world has finally changed and all people will be able to return to the lives they once had."

at peace with the body’s finitude,
at peace with the soul’s disregard
of space and time.

lying between her legs, confused
about the body and the heart.

she answered, at peace with the body’s greed,
at peace with the heart’s bewilderment.

The poem begins with a hint of a story that the speaker's father used to tell him while teaching him the importance of learning a “second tongue.” He recounts how he has been chased to death since his birth. The same old story repeats in the speaker's life when he tries to teach one of his sons the “second tongue,” a reference to the English language. The speaker chooses non-fictional titles for their personal tales in order to include the experiences of those who had to immigrate to a new country. “Survival Strategies and the Melancholy of Racial Assimilation” and “Patterns of Love in Peoples of Diaspora” are some of the titles he uses to talk about immigrant experiences, such as internalizing an alien language, sense of disconnection, and inner mutism."
362,"So various, so beautiful, so new...'
- Matthew Arnold, 'Dover Beach'

Stowed in the sea to invade
the alfresco lash of a diesel-breeze
ratcheting speed into the tide, brunt with
gobfuls of surf phlegmed by cushy come-and-go
tourists prow'd on the cruisers, lording the ministered waves.

Seagull and shoal life
vexing their blarnies upon our huddled
camouflage past the vast crumble of scummed
cliffs, scramming on mulch as thunder unbladders
yobbish rain and wind on our escape hutched in a Bedford van.

Seasons or years we reap
inland, unclocked by the national eye
or stabs in the back, teemed for breathing
sweeps of grass through the whistling asthma of parks,
burdened, ennobled - poling sparks across pylon and pylon.

Swarms of us, grafting in
the black within shot of the moon's
spotlight, banking on the miracle of sun -
span its rainbow, passport us to life. Only then
can it be human to hoick ourselves, bare-faced for the clear.

Imagine my love and I,
our sundry others, Blair'd in the cash
of our beeswax'd cars, our crash clothes, free,
we raise our charged glasses over unparasol'd tables
East, babbling our lingoes, flecked by the chalk of Britannia!","'So various, so beautiful, so new' says the author of the book. 'We are all in this together' he adds. 'And we are all part of the same thing. We are all here to be part of each other's lives' 'We're all in it together,' he says, 'and we're all so happy'","'Look We Have Coming to Dover!' by Daljit Nagra tells of the arrival of immigrants to England and of their lives filled with hard work, fears, and dreams. The poem begins with the speaker describing the terrifying arrival into Dover There is nothing beautiful about this scene. The water is dirty, the tourists lord over them and they fear being spotted. When they finally make it to shore they drive off in an inconspicuous van and try to make lives for themselves. These are hard lives, filled with endless work and the ever-present fear that they're going to be caught and returned to their home country. At the same time, they are able to hope for a better future, as described in the final stanza."
363,"God of lost souls, thou who are lost amongst the gods, hear me:
 
Gentle Destiny that watchest over us, mad, wandering spirits, hear me:
 
I dwell in the midst of a perfect race, I the most imperfect.
 
I, a human chaos, a nebula of confused elements, I move amongst finished worlds—peoples of complete laws and pure order, whose thoughts are assorted, whose dreams are arranged, and whose visions are enrolled and registered.
 
Their virtues, O God, are measured, their sins are weighed, and even the countless things that pass in the dim twilight of neither sin nor virtue are recorded and catalogued.
 
Here days and night are divided into seasons of conduct and governed by rules of blameless accuracy.
 
To eat, to drink, to sleep, to cover one’s nudity, and then to be weary in due time.
 
To work, to play, to sing, to dance, and then to lie still when the clock strikes the hour.
 
To think thus, to feel thus much, and then to cease thinking and feeling when a certain star rises above yonder horizon.
 
To rob a neighbour with a smile, to bestow gifts with a graceful wave of the hand, to praise prudently, to blame cautiously, to destroy a sound with a word, to burn a body with a breath, and then to wash the hands when the day’s work is done.
 
To love according to an established order, to entertain one’s best self in a preconceived manner, to worship the gods becomingly, to intrigue the devils artfully—and then to forget all as though memory were dead.
 
To fancy with a motive, to contemplate with consideration, to be happy sweetly, to suffer nobly—and then to empty the cup so that tomorrow may fill it again.
 
All these things, O God, are conceived with forethought, born with determination, nursed with exactness, governed by rules, directed by reason, and then slain and buried after a prescribed method. And even their silent graves that lie within the human soul are marked and numbered.
 
It is a perfect world, a world of consummate excellence, a world of supreme wonders, the ripest fruit in God’s garden, the master-thought of the universe.
 
But why should I be here, O God, I a green seed of unfulfilled passion, a mad tempest that seeketh neither east nor west, a bewildered fragment from a burnt planet?
 
Why am I here, O God of lost souls, thou who art lost amongst the gods?","God of lost souls, thou who are lost amongst the gods, hear me: Gentle Destiny that watchest over us, mad, wandering spirits. I am a green seed of unfulfilled passion, a mad tempest that seeketh neither east nor west, a bewildered fragment from a burnt planet. It is a perfect world, a world of consummate excellence.","The Perfect World' by Kahlil Gibran describes what a speaker sees as an ideal way to live in order to take advantage of all that God has created, and thereby craft a perfect world. The poem begins with the speaker asking God, the protector of lost souls to watch over him. He is concerned for his own destiny and wants to know why he was created. The speaker does not see himself as being able to attain the high levels of order and structure that appear in the following twenty or so lines. He begins by wondering over his own confused state and how he is supped to exist in-amongst those who have their whole lives figured. He sees the rest of the world as being made up of people who know what to feel, where they're going, and how they're going to get there. In contrast, his thoughts are confused and his emotions unpredictable. As the poem progresses the speaker lays out an impossible standard of life. A perfect world, he believes, would be created if all people were always their best selves, worshiped God perfectly, and lived without conflict. By the end of the text, he has become somewhat desperate and perhaps depressed as he attempts to figure out how he can live as they do."
364,"Time does not bring relief; you all have lied Who told me time would ease me of my pain! I miss him in the weeping of the rain; I want him at the shrinking of the tide;
The old snows melt from every mountain-side, And last year’s leaves are smoke in every lane; But last year’s bitter loving must remain
Heaped on my heart, and my old thoughts abide. There are a hundred places where I fear To go,—so with his memory they brim. And entering with relief some quiet place Where never fell his foot or shone his face I say, “There is no memory of him here!” And so stand stricken, so remembering him.","Time does not bring relief; you all have lied Who told me time would ease me of my pain! I miss him in the weeping of the rain; I want him at the shrinking of the tide. The old snows melt from every mountain-side, And last year’s leaves are smoke in every lane.","Time does not bring relief; you all have lied' by Edna St. Vincent Millay tells of an emotionally damaged woman, seeking relief from heartbreak. The poem begins with this speaker chastising her listeners for lying to her. They told her that any pain she feels, on account of a lost lover, would fade away in time. She is angry because this has not come close to happening. One can assume that a great deal of time has passed, and the speaker's emotions are just as strong as they were when the hurt was fresh. She describes how her longing for her lover is omnipresent. It comes to her in the rain and with tidal changes. In the second stanza, she tells of all the changes she sees going on in the world. The speaker is aware that time is passing around her, but it doesn't touch her inner world. The snow might be melting on the mountains and the leaves being turned into smoke on the road, but she is the same as always. The final lines describe how these emotions have impacted her. Now, no matter where she goes, even if its somewhere he never was, she is “stricken” with thoughts of him. He haunts her heart and mind, in every setting and situation."
365,"Already one day has detached itself from all the rest up ahead.

366,"There's one rides very sagely on the road,
Showing that he affects the gravest mode.
Another rides tantivy, or full trot,
To show much gravity he matters not.
Lo, here comes one amain, he rides full speed,
Hedge, ditch, nor miry bog, he doth not heed.
One claws it up-hill without stop or check,
Another down as if he'd break his neck.
Now every horse has his especial guider;
Then by his going you may know the rider.

Comparison.

Now let us turn our horse into a man,
His rider to a spirit, if we can.
Then let us, by the methods of the guider,
Tell every horse how he should know his rider.
Some go, as men, direct in a right way,
Nor are they suffered to go astray;
As with a bridle they are governed,
And kept from paths which lead unto the dead.
Now this good man has his especial guider,
Then by his going let him know his rider.
Some go as if they did not greatly care,
Whether of heaven or hell they should be heir.
The rein, it seems, is laid upon their neck,
They seem to go their way without a check.
Now this man too has his especial guider,
And by his going he may know his rider.
Some again run as if resolved to die,
Body and soul, to all eternity.
Good counsel they by no means can abide;
They'll have their course whatever them betide.
Now these poor men have their especial guider,
Were they not fools they soon might know their rider.
There's one makes head against all godliness,
Those too, that do profess it, he'll distress;
He'll taunt and flout if goodness doth appear,
And at its countenancers mock and jeer.
Now this man, too, has his especial guider,
And by his going he might know his rider.","There's one rides very sagely on the road, showing that he affects the gravest mode. Another rides tantivy, or full trot, to show much gravity he matters not. Some go as if they did not greatly care, whether of heaven or hell they should be heir.",On the Horse and His Rider' by John Bunyan is an interesting look at the ways that riders control horses and how external forces control riders. The poem compares the rider to his horse and takes the reader through several examples of different ways that men ride. There are those who much more careless with their lives and their horses than others are. They appear to care not whether they end up in the afterlife. The way the horse moves tells the onlooker a lot about the nature of the rider. A horse can also learn about their “guider” in this same way.
367,"I can remember you, child,
As I stood in a hot, white
Room at the window watching
The people and cars taking
Turn at the traffic lights.
I can remember you, our first
Fierce confrontation, the tight
Red rope of love which we both
Fought over. It was a square
Environmental blank, disinfected
Of paintings or toys. I wrote
All over the walls with my
Words, coloured the clean squares
With the wild, tender circles
Of our struggle to become
Separate. We want, we shouted,
To be two, to be ourselves.

Neither won nor lost the struggle
In the glass tank clouded with feelings
Which changed us both. Still I am fighting
You off, as you stand there
With your straight, strong, long
Brown hair and your rosy,
Defiant glare, bringing up
From the heart’s pool that old rope,
Tightening about my life,
Trailing love and conflict,
As you ask may you skate
In the dark, for one more hour.","I can remember you, our firstierce confrontation, the tightRed rope of love which we both                Fought over.

I wrote                All over the walls with my                Words, coloured the clean squares with the wild, tender circles. We want, we shouted,                To be two, to be ourselves.","This poem, ‘Catrin’, displays the love and turmoil in the parent-child relationship. This particular poem centers around a conflict that seems to have escalated into fury rather quickly. Through her use of imagery, the speaker is able to convey feelings of love and affection along with the frustration of dealing with the conflict that inevitably arises between the parent and the child. At the beginning of the poem, the speaker reveals that the person to whom she speaks is a child, but she does not reveal her position immediately. Because the author is female, it is easy to assume that the speaker is the mother. For simplicity’s sake, this analysis will assume as such, and thereby refer to the speaker in the feminine form. However, it is entirely possible that the speaker was the father, in this case. The gender of the child in the poem is not implied until near the end of the poem. Based on the voice of the speaker and the short description of the child, it is most probable that ‘Catrin’ describes a conflict between a mother and daughter. The conflict itself remains unresolved by the end of the poem, but both the mother and the daughter are apparently changed. The intensity of the argument has moved them both, though the speaker does not reveal the specific changes that have taken place. By the end of the poem, the reader can clearly understand the rationale behind the mother’s side of the argument. Allowing the reader to see this rationale also allows him to enter into the feelings of the mother. Just like the mother, the reader is also unable to open the eyes of the child to the practical nature of the mother’s decision. Thus, the reader can enter into the mother’s feelings. The speaker uses concrete imagery to describe her love for the child. This also allows the reader to further understand the complexity of the relationship and the intensity of the conflict. Though the mother is clearly “right” by the end of the poem, she does not feel that she “won”. Rather, she feels as though she has lost something. The daughter, also, clearly feels that she has lost. Somehow, the intensity of this argument has changed both the mother and the daughter. It was clearly a marked turning point in their lives and relationship. Through the vivid description of this conflict, the speaker is able to portray the deep love and affection that a mother has for her child, a love that will drive her to protect and love her children even when the children do not want or understand the need for the protection. The mother continues to love and fight for the protection of her daughter even when the daughter fights against it, giving her a “defiant glare” that leaves the mother feeling that something between them has changed forever. The name of the poem reveals that this poem is, indeed, about her daughter, Catrin."

Housman is a short poem about the poet's understanding of his own writing. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker, Housman, begins by noting that others believe his verse is sad. He knows why, as it does its best to contend with universal themes important to all of humanity. It has a limited scope, though, something that adds to the general sadness of the endeavor. Despite this, he still writes for others. He isn't writing for himself. He doesn't take comfort in his own poetry. It's for those who are in more trouble than he is."

It follows the main character, the Lorax who speaks for the trees and stands up against environmental destruction. The creatures that Seuss created for this book are accompanied by numerous examples of nonsense language and imagery that is stereotypically Seussian. The illustrations are brightly colored and entertaining all on their own. Since its publication, the book has been aimed as one of teacher’s Top 100 Books for Children and ranked in the top of the best picture books ever published

Seuss stated that this book, of all those that he had written, was his favorite. He went on to describe how it allowed him to address both environmental and economic issues and express his exaggeration with the world. 

An interesting piece of trivia that goes along with The Lorax comes in the form of a follow-up publication written by Terri Birkett, who was part of a family-owned hardwood flooring company. The company put out the book as a “logging-friendly” perspective on the environment."

Flynn begins his poem by referring to the expansion of the galaxy in silence. Far away in the outer world, galaxies are constantly at work. While the ten-year-olds are busy learning the concepts of “cartoon physics”. According to the law of cartoons, a man can draw a circle on a rock in order to pass through different dimensions. In some of the animation movies, realism is denied and everything is shown in a way that makes the speaker disturbed. He knows that the character can easily escape from a burning house or a drowning sheep using common sense. While he tries to be a hero there. Such unrealistic events are described in this piece for the sake of satirizing them."

The poem starts out with the speaker noting the time when one returns to the “plain sense of things.” It's after the colorful fall leaves are gone, and one's left with the barren time between autumn and winter. There, the speaker notes, all imagination seems to die. One is left with a silence that feels impenetrable and entirely uncreative. But, this period in which everything seems raw and uninteresting is also a time to reset and reconsider one's work. It is incredibly necessary to continue the creative process."

In this poem, the couple leaves on a wintry night, walking in the frigid temperatures. The next morning, the husband and wife are found dead, of cold and hunger. From the way the couple was positioned, it was obvious that the man had succumbed first, dying with his wife's feet in his hands. He had perished trying to provide heat to his sick and suffering wife.

373,"I, too, saw God through mud—
The mud that cracked on cheeks when wretches smiled.
War brought more glory to their eyes than blood,
And gave their laughs more glee than shakes a child.
Merry it was to laugh there—
Where death becomes absurd and life absurder.
For power was on us as we slashed bones bare
Not to feel sickness or remorse of murder.
I, too, have dropped off fear—
Behind the barrage, dead as my platoon,
And sailed my spirit surging, light and clear
Past the entanglement where hopes lay strewn;
And witnessed exultation—
Faces that used to curse me, scowl for scowl,
Shine and lift up with passion of oblation,
Seraphic for an hour; though they were foul. I have made fellowships—
Untold of happy lovers in old song.
For love is not the binding of fair lips
With the soft silk of eyes that look and long,
But Joy, whose ribbon slips,—
But wound with war’s hard wire whose stakes are strong;
Bound with the bandage of the arm that drips;
Knit in the welding of the rifle-thong.
I have perceived much beauty
In the hoarse oaths that kept our courage straight;
Heard music in the silentness of duty;
Found peace where shell-storms spouted reddest spate.
Nevertheless, except you share
With them in hell the sorrowful dark of hell,
Whose world is but the trembling of a flare,
And heaven but as the highway for a shell,
You shall not hear their mirth:
You shall not come to think them well content
By any jest of mine. These men are worth
Your tears: You are not worth their merriment.","I, too, saw God through mud, the mud that cracked on cheeks when wretches smiled.

Although the war is present, as in all other poetry by Wilfred Owen, it takes a back seat to the description and the liveliness of the soldiers; they are immortalized and made to live before the war brutalized them into insensible men. The Latin title translates to 'an apology on behalf of my poetry'. Although Owen was popularized in later days, at the time he was not considered to be an especially brilliant poet, and being against the war made him a fair few enemies in the pro-war ranks. However, Owen was also a soldier, and his view of camaraderie is very much felt in the lines of 'Apologia Pro Poemate Meo.' In a letter, he wrote to his mother, stating that 'you could not be visited by a band of friends half so fine as surround me here'."

No other sound can be heard in the leaden darkness, except that of the shrill and transient sound of the bird. It is not an ordinary owl. According to the poetic persona, it is “the great black owl.” It seems as if the poet is hinting at something else by referring to this creature. It hoots, “Au” three times and suddenly a voice, probably that of the zoomorphic owl, calls, “Hi! a! haa!”"
376,"Think’st thou I saw thy beauteous eyes,
Suffus’d in tears, implore to stay;
And heard unmov’d thy plenteous sighs,
Which said far more than words can say?

Though keen the grief thy tears exprest,
When love and hope lay both o’erthrown;
Yet still, my girl, this bleeding breast
Throbb’d, with deep sorrow, as thine own.

But, when our cheeks with anguish glow’d,
When thy sweet lips were join’d to mine;
The tears that from my eyelids flow’d
Were lost in those which fell from thine.

Thou could’st not feel my burning cheek,
Thy gushing tears had quench’d its flame,
And, as thy tongue essay’d to speak,
In sighs alone it breath’d my name.

And yet, my girl, we weep in vain,
In vain our fate in sighs deplore;
Remembrance only can remain,
But that, will make us weep the more.

Again, thou best belov’d, adieu!
Ah! if thou canst, o’ercome regret,
Nor let thy mind past joys review,
Our only hope is, to forget!","Think’st thou I saw thy beauteous eyes,                Suffus’d in tears, implore to stay;And heard unmov’D thy plenteous sighs,                Which said far more than words can say?                Though keen the grief thy tears exprest,                When love and hope lay both o’erthrown;                Yet still, my girl, this bleeding breast emphaticallyThrobb’'d, with deep sorrow, as thine own.","Most people wouldn’t think of the kind of man to embark on wildly flamboyant sexual affairs as being one to write expressive, beautiful poetry, but then, Lord George Gordon Byron (biography of Lord Byron) was a very contradictory man, one who could be wildly devoted to pursuing and courting a woman before quickly losing interest after she’d agreed to be with him. Byron’s work, ‘To Caroline’, provides the reader with insights into his very complicated and often troubled relationships with others. Despite the historic nature of the affair, the poem expresses deep sentiments and a strong sense of sorrow. It is an excellent means for assessing some of Lord Byron’s complex character, and a touching piece of poetry as well."
377,"you are my bread

I thinktomorrowtomorrowturned you with his toe.and you will shineunspent and underground.“You are not stone or molten sound” “I think this kind of bird flies backward”,"'The Window' by Diane di Prima is a very subjective and ambiguous poem as it can be interpreted in several ways. A lot of di Prima's works were centered around feminism, class, and sexuality. It makes sense that this poem particularly talks about the artistic freedom and women's voice in the Beat movement of the '50s as compared to their male counterparts. Throughout this piece, di Prima talks about how poetry is her sustenance (“bread”), and it is a vital part of her life and living. She expresses how the voice of female poets is often muted when it contains strong themes and tones. That's why she fears her poems might be “unspent” and go “underground.” She is aware that her words are not “stone.” Thus, they will not be engraved upon and remain unchanged for centuries. However, she still believes that it will shine with all its might wherever her poetry lands."
378,"I
Thy soul shall find itself alone
’Mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone—
Not one, of all the crowd, to pry
Into thine hour of secrecy.
II
Be silent in that solitude,
Which is not loneliness—for then
The spirits of the dead who stood
In life before thee are again
In death around thee—and their will
Shall overshadow thee: be still.
III
The night, tho’ clear, shall frown—
And the stars shall look not down
From their high thrones in the heaven,
With light like Hope to mortals given—
But their red orbs, without beam,
To thy weariness shall seem
As a burning and a fever
Which would cling to thee for ever.

Now are visions ne’er to vanish;
From thy spirit shall they pass
No more—like dew-drop from the grass.

The poem begins with the speaker describing how “you” are standing in a cemetery alone. The speaker describes how “you” are considering life and death and are entirely alone. They make a point to contrast how “you” might be alone in life but in death “you” are going to be surrounded by spirits of the dead. As the poem progresses, the speaker emphasizes the mysterious nature of death, warns against romanticizing it, and personifies nature."
379,"I love thy music, mellow bell,
I love thine iron chime,
To life or death, to heaven or hell,
Which calls the sons of Time.

Thy voice upon the deep
The home-bound sea-boy hails,
It charms his cares to sleep,
It cheers him as he sails.

To house of God and heavenly joys
Thy summons called our sires,
And good men thought thy sacred voice
Disarmed the thunder's fires.

And soon thy music, sad death-bell,
Shall lift its notes once more,
And mix my requiem with the wind
That sweeps my native shore","I love thine iron chime, to life or death, to heaven or hell, which calls the sons of Time. And soon thy music, sad death-bell, will lift its notes once more. And mix my requiem with the wind that sweeps my native shore.","The Bell' by Ralph Waldo Emerson describes the various functions of a bell while also placing importance on its acknowledgment of death. In the first stanza of this piece the speaker begins by telling one specific bell that it is “mellow.” This “iron” sounding instrument functions in a variety of different ways. It notifies one of birth, death, and “heaven or hell.” Life and time are marked by its chiming. In the next two stanzas, the speaker moves through a number of different moments a bell can be used. The first of these is to notify a ship that land is near. This is a joyous occasion that is then contrasted with the quiet moments of attending church. Its history stretches back to a time that mysticism ruled. Emerson's speaker mentions “good men” attempting to “Disarm” thunder and lightning with the sound of a bell. The poem concludes with the speaker bringing the narrative back to his own life. There has been some tragedy in the area. It is far-stretching enough to call for a “death-bell.” The sound is going to be heard across the shore and mix with the wind and the speaker's own requiem."
380,"The sister here is telling my mother
How she came to collect children
Because they were crippled or dark or girls.

Covered in garbage, stuffed in bags,
Abandoned at their doorstep.

Thinking the head barely poking above the ground
Was bone or wood, something to chew.

The parents wait at the gates.
They are American so they know about ceremony
And tradition, about doing things right.

They haven't seen or touched her yet.
Don't know of her fetish for plucking hair off hands,
Or how her mother tried to bury her.

But they are crying.
We couldn't stop crying, my mother said,
Feeling the strangeness of her empty arms.


This girl grows up on video tapes,
Sees how she's passed from woman
To woman. She returns to twilight corners.

To the day of her birth, How it happens in some desolate hut
Outside village boundaries
Where mothers go to squeeze out life,

Watch body slither out from body,
Feel for penis or no penis,
Toss the baby to the heap of others,

Trudge home to lie down for their men again.","The sister here is telling my mother how she came to collect children because they were crippled or dark or girls.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that she and her mother are in a convent, looking for a child. This child, who was found buried and left for dead, is brought to America. Here she meets her adoptive parents, grows up, and then begins to look into her own story. The final lines describe the terrifying lives of women in rural India and the horrible choices they are forced to make."

once every year of my life, spin across the wilds of the sky like a tiny, African god,
I feel dead. I feel as if I were the residue of a stranger’s life, that I should pursue you.

This piece is dedicated to Tate's father, who was a co-pilot of a fighting jet. He died in combat in 1944 when Tate was barely a few months old. He did not see his father and grew up only with the memories implanted by others. Through this piece, he tries to show the love he has for his father. He delves through his deep emotions in order to unravel how he actually feels for him. His father did not think of his family nor of his infant child. He selfishly went to the battlefield and died. This poem is all about the loneliness, sadness, and angst of Tate."

In this poem, the speaker talks about how she gathers her imaginary friends like talismans and invites them for tarot card gossip. She imagines how they undress in her mind's studio. Their looks make her so unsettled that she can see a vagina folding itself like a mandala, a symbol of dream and self-fulfillment. The speaker uses their image in order to intensify her bodily desires. She lets the sensual tea steep till the bodily pot becomes black with the liquor. In this heightened state, she does not require anybody's assistance to please herself. Those imaginary characters are impregnated in her own mind. There is no need for any physical pain to seal her bond with them."

The poet narrates the story vividly, dramatically, and with almost a Dantesque concentration. A big bird, a swan with great wings has been represented as giving a sudden and staggering blow to the girl (Leda) bathing naked in a pond. The bird fluttering over her, caressing her thighs, holding her nape with his beak, and pressing her helpless (bare) breast upon his chest, must have been a nerve-shattering experience for the terrified girl. She was helpless in the clutches of the brute blood of their air, and her helplessness is signified by the 'loosening of her thighs', which is an expression rich in overtones of sexuality. In this way, an immortal god mated with a mortal girl. The event proved a fateful one as it set in motion a whole chain of events. The girl gave birth to Helen and the result was the Trojan War and the burning of the roof and 'topless' towers of Troy. She also gave birth to Clytemnestra and the result was the tragedy of Agamemnon. Clytemnestra was the queen of Agamemnon but she got so angry with him that she with the help of his children killed her own husband."

Are you going to eat that? I say to my mother, pointing to my father who is lying on the dining room table, his mouth stuffed with a red apple.

bumped in to the others, the missing boys from small towns, with pleasant mothers, who did bad things and got lost in the maze of
my hair. I treat them well enough, a slice of bread, if they’re lucky a piece of fruit. Except for Johnny with the blue eyes, who picked my locks and crawled in. Silly boy, chained to the basement of my fears, I play music to drown him out.

In this poem, the speaker describes the situation that makes one leave their dear country, home, and belongings. When the big shark-like countrymen hunt down others, bloodthirsty and ferocious, there is no other way out than to flee one's country. The boy once the speaker made love with, holds a gun bigger than his body, waiting for her or his family. Thus, there is only one option left for the speaker: running. Throughout this poem, the narrator describes horrific events that refugees have to endure on their journey out. For instance, women are sexually exploited by men of their father's age. On top of that, they are sexually exploited by the prison guard. Reiterating the statement, “no one leaves home” or “no one chooses refugee camps” (or such a life), the narrator wants to portray the helplessness of the refugees worldwide. "

The poem takes the reader through various ways in which the reader can rise above adversity that will almost certainly be thrown one's way at some point. Throughout the poem, the speaker gives the reader multiple scenarios, both positive and negative, along with a glimpse into how one should conduct oneself. The poem has an almost mathematical proof about it with its if-then scenario. Kipling leaves the “then” until the final two lines, revealing to the reader that if he or she is able to do all that was just mentioned, he or she will not only have the world at his or her fingertips, but he or she will also be a “Man.”"

This piece presents a set of images in each stanza. The first stanza begins with two sets of images. Simic depicts how the grandmothers wring the necks of chickens and old nuns pull the naughty schoolboys by the ear. Even a pickpocket's intricate movement captures his attention. He connects these daily acts to the art of dancing in the final stanza of the poem.

The poem begins with the speaker directing their words to a specific listener, someone who has passed away. The speaker and their family members did not know that this person was going to die that day or “that God was going to call your name.” But, the speaker explains how everyone on Earth loves this deceased person in the same way they did when they were alive. As the poem progresses, the speaker describes how everyone is devastated that this person has died, but they did not go to Heaven alone. Memories and love went with them, and one day they will all be reunited in Heaven at God's side."

The poem starts with a surprising comparison between a fork and a strange thing that's crawled “right out of hell.” It's creature-like, specifically like the foot of a bird. The fork-creature also looks like something that might be worn as a trophy around a cannibal's neck. As the poem continues, the speaker crafts an even stronger image of “you” using the work and one's fist becoming the beakless, blind head of a bird."
389,"First Voice
'But tell me, tell me! speak again,
Thy soft response renewing—
What makes that ship drive on so fast?
What is the ocean doing?'

Second Voice
Still as a slave before his lord,
The ocean hath no blast;
His great bright eye most silently
Up to the Moon is cast—

If he may know which way to go;
For she guides him smooth or grim.
See, brother, see! how graciously
She looketh down on him.'

First Voice
'But why drives on that ship so fast,
Without or wave or wind?'

Second Voice
'The air is cut away before,
And closes from behind.

Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high!
Or we shall be belated:
For slow and slow that ship will go,
When the Mariner's trance is abated.'

I woke, and we were sailing on
As in a gentle weather:
'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high;
The dead men stood together.

All stood together on the deck,
For a charnel-dungeon fitter:
All fixed on me their stony eyes,
That in the Moon did glitter.

The pang, the curse, with which they died,
Had never passed away:
I could not draw my eyes from theirs,
Nor turn them up to pray.

And now this spell was snapt: once more
I viewed the ocean green,
And looked far forth, yet little saw
Of what had else been seen—

Like one, that on a lonesome road
Doth walk in fear and dread,
And having once turned round walks on,
And turns no more his head;
Because he knows, a frightful fiend
Doth close behind him tread.

But soon there breathed a wind on me,
Nor sound nor motion made:
Its path was not upon the sea,
In ripple or in shade.

It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek
Like a meadow-gale of spring—
It mingled strangely with my fears,
Yet it felt like a welcoming.

Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,
Yet she sailed softly too:
Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze—
On me alone it blew.

Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed
The light-house top I see?
Is this the hill? is this the kirk?
Is this mine own countree?

We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,
And I with sobs did pray—
O let me be awake, my God!
Or let me sleep alway.

The harbour-bay was clear as glass,
So smoothly it was strewn!
And on the bay the moonlight lay,
And the shadow of the Moon.

The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,
That stands above the rock:
The moonlight steeped in silentness
The steady weathercock.

And the bay was white with silent light,
Till rising from the same,
Full many shapes, that shadows were,
In crimson colours came.

A little distance from the prow
Those crimson shadows were:
I turned my eyes upon the deck—
Oh, Christ! what saw I there!

Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,
And, by the holy rood!
A man all light, a seraph-man,
On every corse there stood.

This seraph-band, each waved his hand:
It was a heavenly sight!
They stood as signals to the land,
Each one a lovely light;

This seraph-band, each waved his hand,
No voice did they impart—
No voice; but oh! the silence sank
Like music on my heart.

But soon I heard the dash of oars,
I heard the Pilot's cheer;
My head was turned perforce away
And I saw a boat appear.

The Pilot and the Pilot's boy,
I heard them coming fast:
Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy
The dead men could not blast.

I saw a third—I heard his voice:
It is the Hermit good!
He singeth loud his godly hymns
That he makes in the wood.
He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away
The Albatross's blood.","'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high; the dead men stood together.

The first and second voice introduced in the fifth section continue to talk in the sixth. They explain that the sea and the moon are working to navigate the ship and then fly away. The Mariner wakes up beside the dead sailors and the ship moves steadily onward, eventually arriving at the Mariner's home. There, he weeps and prays that he isn't dreaming. He sees the angels leave the bodies of the dead soldiers and hears silent music. Finally, he sees a small boat with several people in it. He hopes the Hermit will be able to absolve him of his sin of killing the albatross."
390,"With blackest moss the flower-plots
Were thickly crusted, one and all:
The rusted nails fell from the knots
That held the pear to the gable-wall.
The broken sheds look'd sad and strange:
Unlifted was the clinking latch;
Weeded and worn the ancient thatch
Upon the lonely moated grange.
She only said, ""My life is dreary,
He cometh not,"" she said;
She said, ""I am aweary, aweary,
I would that I were dead!""

Her tears fell with the dews at even;
Her tears fell ere the dews were dried;
She could not look on the sweet heaven,
Either at morn or eventide.
After the flitting of the bats,
When thickest dark did trance the sky,
She drew her casement-curtain by,
And glanced athwart the glooming flats.
She only said, ""The night is dreary,
He cometh not,"" she said;
She said, ""I am aweary, aweary,
I would that I were dead!""

Upon the middle of the night,
Waking she heard the night-fowl crow:
The cock sung out an hour ere light:
From the dark fen the oxen's low
Came to her: without hope of change,
In sleep she seem'd to walk forlorn,
Till cold winds woke the gray-eyed morn
About the lonely moated grange.
She only said, ""The day is dreary,
He cometh not,"" she said;
She said, ""I am aweary, aweary,
I would that I were dead!""

About a stone-cast from the wall
A sluice with blacken'd waters slept,
And o'er it many, round and small,
The cluster'd marish-mosses crept.
Hard by a poplar shook alway,
All silver-green with gnarled bark:
For leagues no other tree did mark
The level waste, the rounding gray.
She only said, ""My life is dreary,
He cometh not,"" she said;
She said ""I am aweary, aweary
I would that I were dead!""

And ever when the moon was low,
And the shrill winds were up and away,
In the white curtain, to and fro,
She saw the gusty shadow sway.
But when the moon was very low
And wild winds bound within their cell,
The shadow of the poplar fell
Upon her bed, across her brow.
She only said, ""The night is dreary,
He cometh not,"" she said;
She said ""I am aweary, aweary,
I would that I were dead!""

All day within the dreamy house,
The doors upon their hinges creak'd;
The blue fly sung in the pane; the mouse
Behind the mouldering wainscot shriek'd,
Or from the crevice peer'd about.
Old faces glimmer'd thro' the doors
Old footsteps trod the upper floors,
Old voices called her from without.
She only said, ""My life is dreary,
He cometh not,"" she said;
She said, ""I am aweary, aweary,
I would that I were dead!""

The sparrow's chirrup on the roof,
The slow clock ticking, and the sound
Which to the wooing wind aloof
The poplar made, did all confound
Her sense; but most she loathed the hour
When the thick-moted sunbeam lay
Athwart the chambers, and the day
Was sloping toward his western bower.
Then said she, ""I am very dreary,
He will not come,"" she said;
She wept, ""I am aweary, aweary,
Oh God, that I were dead!""","With blackest moss the flower-plots were thickly crusted, one and all. The rusted nails fell from the knots that held the pear to the gable-wall.

The stanzas of this poem take the reader through a series of images that depict outwardly the inner emotional turmoil that Mariana is experiencing. Her emotions are transmuted onto the larger setting. The speaker describes a dark and abandoned farmhouse that is falling apart. It is in desperate need of repair but no one is there to tend to it. Just as Mariana's mind is slipping away from light, happiness, and hope for the future, so too are her surroundings. Towards the middle of the poem, a very important image shows itself, a poplar tree. It is the only thing to be seen on the flat and featureless landscape that surrounds the farmhouse. This tree, which stands upright in an otherwise flat field, is often interpreted as a phallic symbol. This is emphasized by the poplar tree's shadow that falls across Mariana's bed at night. The speaker does not reach a conclusion about Mariana's future nor does Mariana make any kind of transition away from mourning her lover. Rather, the poem continues to reiterate these dark symbols and emotions. It concludes with Mariana stating that she has become “dreary“."
391,"When I was sixteen I met a dark girl;
Her dark hair was darker because her smile was so bright;
She was the girl with the keys to Pearse's Cottage;
And her name was Cáit Killann.

The cottage was built into the side of a hill;
I recall two windows and a cosmic peace
Of bare brown rooms and on whitewashed walls
Photographs of the passionate and pale Pearse.

I recall wet thatch and peeling jambs
And how all was best seen from below in the field;
I used to sit in the rushes with ledger-book and pencil
Compiling poems of passion for Cáit Killann.


Often she used linger on the sill of a window;
Hands by her side and brown legs akimbo;
In sun-red skirt and moon-black blazer;
Looking toward our strange world wide-eyed.

Our world was strange because it had no future;
She was America-bound at summer's end.
She had no choice but to leave her home -
The girl with the keys to Pearse's Cottage.

You have gone with your keys from your own native place.
Yet here in this dark - El Greco eyes blaze back
From your Connemara postman's daughter's proudly mortal face.",When I was sixteen I met a dark girl. Her dark hair was darker because her smile was so bright. She was the girl with the keys to Pearse's Cottage. And her name was Cáit Killann.

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins by describing Cáit and telling the reader he met her when he was sixteen. She used to sit in the window of Pearse's cottage, while he sat below in the field writing love poems to her. Their “world” was a “strange” one as it had no future. She departed for America and he was left with his poignant memories of her."

This poem takes the reader through a series of images that are described through a dog's eyes. He sees lamp posts as trees with moons and ascribes importance and unimportance to different things that a human might. He's willing to eat the cow or the policeman but would prefer the former. The dog follows his nose, understands the things that are larger than himself and smaller. He knows reality and sees it as his existence allows him to. In the middle of the poem, Ferlinghetti introduces politics and a discussion about free will through reference to a specific congressman that the dog is disturbed by. He isn't afraid of this person, as he knows the truth about his own nature, but he is bothered. Towards the end of the poem the language becomes more complex, the margins disappear and Ferlinghetti introduces themes of free will, God, religion, politics, and the meaning of life."
393,"With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children,
England mourns for her dead across the sea.
Flesh of her flesh they were, spirit of her spirit,
Fallen in the cause of the free.

Solemn the drums thrill; Death august and royal 
Sings sorrow up into immortal spheres,
There is music in the midst of desolation
And a glory that shines upon our tears.

They went with songs to the battle, they were young,
Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow.
They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted;
They fell with their faces to the foe.

They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old: 
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.
At the going down of the sun and in the morning
We will remember them.

They mingle not with their laughing comrades again; 
They sit no more at familiar tables of home;
They have no lot in our labour of the day-time;
They sleep beyond England's foam.

But where our desires are and our hopes profound, 
Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight,
To the innermost heart of their own land they are known
As the stars are known to the Night;

As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust, 
Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain;
As the stars that are starry in the time of our darkness, 
To the end, to the end, they remain.","With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children, England mourns for her dead across the sea.

In the first lines of 'For the Fallen,' the speaker begins by personifying England. He depicts the country as a mother to all her citizens. She thanks them for the services they've given to her. She “mourns her dead across the sea.” They are lost to her shores, but she recognizes the sacrifice they've made. It soon becomes clear that they were fighting for freedom, specifically in the First World War. Despite how terrible these losses are, there is still music. It celebrates their bravery. The following stanzas depict what the soldiers were like who marched into battle. They were sharp, young, loyal, filled with patriotic duty, and firm in their stance against the enemy. They knew their chances of surviving the war were slim, but they fought on and faced down death until it took them. The speaker discusses how things have changed drastically for these men. They are never going to return home to their families and sit around the table again. They've been put to rest far from their native land. But, they will live on in their family member's memories and in the hearts of all those who benefit from their service. They will shine in the sky as eternal stars, outlasting those who did not die in the war."
394,"For me, the naked and the nude
(By lexicographers construed
As synonyms that should express
The same deficiency of dress
Or shelter) stand as wide apart
As love from lies, or truth from art.

Lovers without reproach will gaze
On bodies naked and ablaze;
The Hippocratic eye will see
In nakedness, anatomy;
And naked shines the Goddess when
She mounts her lion among men.

The nude are bold, the nude are sly
To hold each treasonable eye.
While draping by a showman's trick
Their dishabille in rhetoric,
They grin a mock-religious grin
Of scorn at those of naked skin.

The naked, therefore, who compete
Against the nude may know defeat;
Yet when they both together tread
The briary pastures of the dead,
By Gorgons with long whips pursued,
How naked go the sometimes nude!","For me, the naked and the nude stand as wide apart as love from lies, or truth from art. The nude are bold, the nude are sly.

The speaker addresses the two ways of being as wholly different from one another. They are as estranged as lies and love and art and truth. The poet uses several examples to describe how these two things are different, as seen through the eyes of doctors, lovers, and art. But, by the end of the poem, he comes to the conclusion that in reality they really aren't so different. Whether one is naked or nude the afterlife is always waiting."

The grass is half-covered with snow.
It was the sort of snowfall that starts in late afternoon
And now the little houses of the grass are growing dark.

If I reached my hands down near the earth
I could take handfuls of darkness!
A darkness was always there which we never noticed.

As the snow grows heavier the cornstalks fade farther away
And the barn moves nearer to the house.

The barn is full of corn and moves toward us now. All the sailors on deck have been blind for many years. The snow grows heavier and the cornstalks fade farther away.,"'Snowfall in the Afternoon' by Robert Bly is a beautiful poem describing how snow transforms a landscape. Throughout interesting images that focus on the transformation of a landscape, the poet creates a semi-surrealistic, dreamlike narrative. It ends with the image of blind sailors on a boat at sea for many years. The poem leaves readers without any answers to their questions and will likely create a variety of impressions."
396,"Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?

Thou art more lovely and more temperate:

Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,

And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,

And often is his gold complexion dimmed,

And every fair from fair sometime declines,

By chance, or nature’s changing course untrimmed:

But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,

Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,

When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st,

 So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,

 So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.","Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?774. So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.774. But thy eternal summer shall not fade, nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,774.","The poem opens with the speaker putting forward a simple question: can he compare his lover to a summer’s day? Historically, the theme of summertime has always been used to evoke a certain amount of beauty, particularly in poetry. Summer has always been seen as the respite from the long, bitter winter, a growing period where the earth flourishes itself with flowers and with animals once more. Thus, to compare his lover to a summer’s day, the speaker considers their beloved to be tantamount to a rebirth, and even better than summer itself. As summer is occasionally short, too hot, and rough, summer is, in fact, not the height of beauty for this particular speaker. Instead, he attributes that quality to his beloved, whose beauty will never fade, even when ‘death brag thou waander’stin his shade‘, as he will immortalize his lover’s beauty in his verse."
397,"The winter evening settles down
With smell of steaks in passageways.
Six o’clock.
The burnt-out ends of smoky days.
And now a gusty shower wraps
The grimy scraps
Of withered leaves about your feet
And newspapers from vacant lots;
The showers beat
On broken blinds and chimney-pots,
And at the corner of the street
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.

And then the lighting of the lamps.


The morning comes to consciousness
Of faint stale smells of beer
From the sawdust-trampled street
With all its muddy feet that press
To early coffee-stands.

With the other masquerades
That time resumes,
One thinks of all the hands
That are raising dingy shades
In a thousand furnished rooms.


You tossed a blanket from the bed,
You lay upon your back, and waited;
You dozed, and watched the night revealing
The thousand sordid images
Of which your soul was constituted;
They flickered against the ceiling.
And when all the world came back
And the light crept up between the shutters
And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,
You had such a vision of the street
As the street hardly understands;
Sitting along the bed’s edge, where
You curled the papers from your hair,
Or clasped the yellow soles of feet
In the palms of both soiled hands.


His soul stretched tight across the skies
That fade behind a city block,
Or trampled by insistent feet
At four and five and six o’clock;
And short square fingers stuffing pipes,
And evening newspapers, and eyes
Assured of certain certainties,
The conscience of a blackened street
Impatient to assume the world.

I am moved by fancies that are curled
Around these images, and cling:
The notion of some infinitely gentle
Infinitely suffering thing.

Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;
The worlds revolve like ancient women
Gathering fuel in vacant lots.",The winter evening settles down with smell of steaks in passageways. The morning comes to consciousness with faint stale smells of beer. The worlds revolve like ancient women gathering fuel in vacant lots. The thousand sordid images of which your soul was constituted flickered against ceiling.,"Preludes' by T.S. Eliot contains a complex imagistic narrative on the dark and depressing nature of city life and the state of the human soul. The poem begins with the speaker describing a city just entering into the night. He pays close attention to the smell of steak in the air and the fact that there is a lot of grime on the ground. There are newspapers and many other miscellaneous pieces of trash. All of these blow around “your” feet. The first section ends with all the indoor lamps turning on. When the poem resumes in the second section it is morning again and the city is regaining consciousness. There is a smell of beer on the air and everyone is pulling up their dirty blinds, unhappy to face another day that is exactly like the last. The third section depicts “your” particular experience. This person had a night filled with sordid dreams straight from the soul. When “you” finally get up, it takes some time but “you” eventually make it back into “your” life. The last lines give the reader a little bit of hope that maybe the timeless, miserable way of living will not go on forever. "
398,"This door you might not open, and you did;
So enter now, and see for what slight thing
You are betrayed... Here is no treasure hid,
No cauldron, no clear crystal mirroring

For greed like yours, no writhings of distress,
But only what you see... Look yet again—
An empty room, cobwebbed and comfortless.
Yet this alone out of my life I kept
Unto myself, lest any know me quite;
And you did so profane me when you crept
Unto the threshold of this room to-night
That I must never more behold your face.

In the first lines, the speaker, who a reader may assume is Bluebeard himself, addresses his wife. He speaks calmly but with a clear disappointment and solemnity. His wife went into the one place in the entire castle that he asked her not to. Now, in his irritation and disappointment, he shows her around the empty room, thus proving to her that there's nothing to fear. Unlike the original story, the room is empty. It doesn't contain the heads of his previous wives. She betrayed him for nothing. He calls her action greedy. She took the one thing from him he wanted to keep for himself. The poem concludes with Bluebeard telling the wife that she can have the whole “place”. He's going to find somewhere else that he can live without the threat of betrayal and the invasion of his personal physical and mental space. "

'To a Friend' by Amy Lowell, the poetic persona asks her friend only one thing, “always you will be my dream of you”. The line says it all. The poet adores the bond friendship much more than anything else in her life. She believes it is hard to find a friend and to keep the friendship is harder enough. In this world, it is not easy to find a person who can understand one's true self. If the poet finds one, she never wants to befriend that person. She knows, “The world is full of rude awakenings” but she also believes in “beauty through all wrongs”. It is the beauty of friendship which makes her life lyrical as a song."

Come drifting to my feet.
They flutter the shore in a drowsy tune,
Unfurl their bloom to the lightlorn sky,

The poem begins with the speaker setting the scene. He is on a beach and his feet are just touching the water. Night has fallen around him and the only light that remains is that which comes from the moon. He seems to be at a point of convergence where the wind, sea, and moon are all present. The main characters of the poem surface from the depths of the sea, they are white, pure, flowers. These flowers are representations of the speaker's unspoken words and unrealized dreams. The flowers exist no matter what humankind does to the planet, and will be there long after all human beings are gone."

'The Émigrée' by Carol Rumens is a poem about a child who emigrated to a new city. The child's feelings and realization after coming into a new culture and linguistic environment, form the basis of the poem. Moreover, the “sunlight” clear memory of her native place, presents how much she adored her old city. Apart from that, there is a constant conflict in her heart regarding the new city. She can't speak the language properly. However, the past seems to hold her back and resist her from getting into the new journey. At last, she strongly claims her cultural identity as if the shadow behind her in the daylight, is nothing but her old identity. Along with that, the sunlight reminds her of the value of her culture that is going to be washed away in near future."

of his chair, and when he held out
a piece of bread on his open palm,

its place without even a thank you,

Wild as the wave,
Here pause-and, thro' the starting tear,
Survey this grave.

The poor inhabitant below
Was quick to learn the wise to know,
And keenly felt the friendly glow,
And softer flame;
But thoughtless follies laid him low,
And stain'd his name!

Reader, attend! whether thy soul
Soars fancy's flights beyond the pole,
Or darkling grubs this earthly hole,
In low pursuit:
Know, prudent, cautious, self-control
Is wisdom's root.","Is there a whim-inspired fool, fast for thought, hot for rule, hot to rule, with a frater-feeling strong, like a whim? Is there a bard of rustic song, who steals the crowds among, that weekly this area throngs among? If so, let him draw near; let him drap a tear.","'A Bard's Epitaph' by Robert Burns describes how the poet was as a human being and what one could learn from his life. 'A Bard's Epitaph' by Robert Burns talks about the poet's imaginary grave in the first stanza. It draws the attention of the people who throng around it at times. Moreover, the lines written in the poet's grave remind of his contribution to Scottish literary tradition. There is a wise person who stands by the grave of the poet. Even the person drops a tear to see the “whim-inspired fool” who once pleased people with his rusting songs. Whereas in the last two stanzas, the poet talks about his mindless follies that stained his “name”. At last, the poet requests the readers to learn from his life. One should know that prudence, alertness, and self-control are the three ingredients that make one wise in life."
404,"Now when she cries
 for milk,
now as she drinks
 I drift back
to the moments when she was
almost out
still part of me
but already I could reach down
 and touch her hair.
I want to return
to her moment of birth.
It was too quick.
I want it to go on –
When the pain was suddenly
defined by her head,
when she was about to slide out
 safely
all by herself – I felt my heart
go half-way out with her …
like seeing a beloved one off
to a harbour, to a ship
destined to go
to a far away place
 you’ve never been to …
But I could touch
 her hair –
a thick, fuzzy heat.
Sticky feathers clung
wet to runny whites of eggs …
But this is a little person
who already has
a favourite sleeping position.

Weeks pass, the bleeding stops.
Months pass –
What I thought could never heal
actually heals.
And still there is this need
to recall the journey,
retell the story.
The urge
to reopen every detail
until our faces glow again.
What are we
trying to understand?","When she cries for milk I drift back to the moments when she was almost out. I want to returnto her moment of birth. It was too quick. But I could touch her hair – thick, fuzzy heat. She already has a favourite sleeping position. What I thought could never heal actually heals.","'The Need to Recall the Journey' by Sujata Bhatt depicts a mother's desire to return, time and time again, to memories of childbirth. The poem starts with the speaker describing how it's very easy to take herself back to the moments her child was only partially born. She nurses her baby and remembers what it was like to be in labor and feel her child being born but not having her in the world yet. As her child was born, it was like letting go of a loved one about to embark on a long ship voyage, she writes. It's sorrowful but something that one has to accept. Now, time has passed, and her body has healed. But, this only seems to inspire the speaker to retell stories of her child's birth with more urgency, trying to recapture what the experience was like."
405,"I
O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being,
Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,

Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,
Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,
Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed

The winged seeds, where they lie cold and low,
Each like a corpse within its grave, until
Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow

Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill
(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)
With living hues and odours plain and hill:

Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;
Destroyer and preserver; hear, oh hear!

II
Thou on whose stream, mid the steep sky's commotion,
Loose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed,
Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,

Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread
On the blue surface of thine aëry surge,
Like the bright hair uplifted from the head

Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge
Of the horizon to the zenith's height,
The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge

Of the dying year, to which this closing night
Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre,
Vaulted with all thy congregated might

Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere
Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: oh hear!

III
Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams
The blue Mediterranean, where he lay,
Lull'd by the coil of his crystalline streams,

Beside a pumice isle in Baiae's bay,
And saw in sleep old palaces and towers
Quivering within the wave's intenser day,

All overgrown with azure moss and flowers
So sweet, the sense faints picturing them! Thou
For whose path the Atlantic's level powers

Cleave themselves into chasms, while far below
The sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear
The sapless foliage of the ocean, know

Thy voice, and suddenly grow gray with fear,
And tremble and despoil themselves: oh hear!

IV
If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;
If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;
A wave to pant beneath thy power, and share

The impulse of thy strength, only less free
Than thou, O uncontrollable! If even
I were as in my boyhood, and could be

The comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven,
As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speed
Scarce seem'd a vision; I would ne'er have striven

As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.
Oh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!
I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!

A heavy weight of hours has chain'd and bow'd
One too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.

V
Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is:
What if my leaves are falling like its own!
The tumult of thy mighty harmonies

Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone,
Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,
My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!

Drive my dead thoughts over the universe
Like wither'd leaves to quicken a new birth!
And, by the incantation of this verse,

Scatter, as from an unextinguish'd hearth
Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!
Be through my lips to unawaken'd earth

The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,
If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?","The West Wind is said to be the breath of Autumn's being. The verse is written in the form of a chant. The words are written in Latin and are intended to be spoken in a high voice. They include the words: ""O wild West Wind, thou breath of autumn's being""","'Ode to the West Wind' by Percy Bysshe Shelley focuses on the west wind, a powerful and destructive force, yet a necessary one. In the first lines, the speaker addresses the wind and describes how it creates deadly storms. it drives away the summer and brings with it the cold and darkness of winter. He imagines what it would be like to be a dead leaf lifted and blown around by the wind and he implores the wind to lift him “as a wave, a lead, a cloud!” The speaker sees the wind as a necessary evil, one that eventually means that spring is on the way."

""And your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head —
Do you think, at your age, it is right?""
""In my youth,"" father William replied to his son,
""I feared it would injure the brain;
But now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
Why, I do it again and again.""

And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door —

For anything tougher than suet;

And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,

That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose —

Said his father; ""don't give yourself airs!

This confusion pairs well with the odd inquiries posed by the “son,” as well as the odd responses of the “father,” and the mixture of bizarre proves to be a perfect circumstance to mirror the theme of ‘You Are Old, Father William’. That theme involves generation gaps—specifically how different generations can fail to understand one another."

We gave it our lives.,"Inauguration by Lorenzo Thomas begins by focusing on the 'land', then moving on to human issues. We have occupied the land, it has been here long before we were. Even knowing this invasion, humanity has proceeded to destroy the world, leaking waves of pollution into the atmosphere all while social inequality is rampant. Thomas moves through these ideas, looking at war and bombings as his first point of contention. Thomas follows this by looking at the factors that underline societal values, 'acumen', and a 'carnivorous' nature that places money and the economy as more important than human life. Further destroying the land, humanity has allowed 'deadly smoke' to pool over 'icecaps', global warming caused by relentless progress without caution. Especially considering the close links with the word 'inauguration' and the American political system, combined with the focus on 'bull markets' (the New York Stock Exchange quite literally featuring a symbolic representation of this 'bull' on Wall Street), it is justified to suggest this poem is directed at American society."

In this poem, the speaker shares what she has on her mind. According to her, when she is in Rome, she feels it is better in his home. But when she returns to her native land, she starts to miss Rome. In the second stanza, the speaker refers to her beloved. She is “spectacularly bored” in this relationship. For this reason, she does not hide her feelings. She asks him to leave. Lastly, she humorously asks him whether he can return when she screams to have him back."
409,"It lieth, gazing on the midnight sky, Upon the cloudy mountain peak supine; Below, far lands are seen tremblingly; Its horror and its beauty are divine. Upon its lips and eyelids seems to lie Loveliness like a shadow, from which shrine, Fiery and lurid, struggling underneath, The agonies of anguish and of death.

The poem begins with the speaker outlining how it would feel to look at Medusa if one was able to without turning to stone. He interprets her thoughts through her shadowed gaze as being those of anguish and death. As the poem continues the speaker describes how the snakes move on her head and their skins shed, transforming them endlessly throughout time. Medusa is on a rock in the water, looking down at the smaller creatures below her. It is their mistake, coming within range of her gaze, that allows the snakes to gleam their “brazen glare.”"

She was going to be a millionaire or multi-millionaire within no time. Naturally, she was elated. Moreover, they told the poet of “giving way to” her “emotion”. After a moment, she realized what they were talking about might be fake. That's why she told them when she would get the cheque or the money. Humorously, they answered they didn't deal with money. The experience was what they dealt in and “the line went dead”."

But this I know: it came to pass
Upon a bright and sunny day

Between the blades of tender corn;

The poem begins with the speaker outlining the setting and telling her listener that there is something important she can't tell them. This does not impede her from talking around “it.” Whatever happened to her occurred in May, in days she now recalls fondly, and with a deep longing. She loved this time period for how it sat on the edge of life. Death was so far off the month seemed without end. In the last lines, the speaker reiterates what she conveyed in the first three. She also states that now that the event is in the past, she feels cold. This is a distinct change from the warmth of the sun in the previous lines."
412,"Not in the world of light alone,
Where God has built his blazing throne,
Nor yet alone in earth below,
With belted seas that come and go,
And endless isles of sunlit green,
Is all thy Maker’s glory seen:
Look in upon thy wondrous frame,—
Eternal wisdom still the same!

The smooth, soft air with pulse-like waves
Flows murmuring through its hidden caves,
Whose streams of brightening purple rush,
Fired with a new and livelier blush,
While all their burden of decay
The ebbing current steals away,
And red with Nature’s flame they start
From the warm fountains of the heart.

No rest that throbbing slave may ask,
Forever quivering o’er his task,
While far and wide a crimson jet
Leaps forth to fill the woven net
Which in unnumbered crossing tides
The flood of burning life divides,
Then, kindling each decaying part,
Creeps back to find the throbbing heart.

But warmed with that unchanging flame
Behold the outward moving frame,
Its living marbles jointed strong
With glistening band and silvery thong,
And linked to reason’s guiding reins
By myriad rings in trembling chains,
Each graven with the threaded zone
Which claims it as the master’s own.

See how yon beam of seeming white
Is braided out of seven-hued light,
Yet in those lucid globes no ray
By any chance shall break astray.
Hark how the rolling surge of sound,
Arches and spirals circling round,
Wakes the hushed spirit through thine ear
With music it is heaven to hear.

Then mark the cloven sphere that holds
All thought in its mysterious folds;
That feels sensation’s faintest thrill,
And flashes forth the sovereign will;
Think on the stormy world that dwells
Locked in its dim and clustering cells!
The lightning gleams of power it sheds
Along its hollow glassy threads!

O Father! grant thy love divine
To make these mystic temples thine!
When wasting age and wearying strife
Have sapped the leaning walls of life,
When darkness gathers over all,
And the last tottering pillars fall,
Take the poor dust thy mercy warms,
And mould it into heavenly forms!","Not in the world of light alone, where God has built his blazing throne, is all thy Maker’s glory seen.

The poem begins with the speaker describing how one could look to heaven, the earth, and within the human body and still not come to a full understanding of God's power. He speaks of the “wondrous frame” of humankind and the “Eternal wisdom” of God that lives inside it. In the next stanza he goes on to describes how humanity is intrinsically linked to the natural world. The blowing of the winds and the flowing of the rivers bring in and out life and death. They lead to and from the human heart and the “flame” that is God's power. The speaker moves on to reference a “slave” who is toiling over a body of water. The mundanity of the scene is interrupted by a “crimson jet” overhead, reminding one that God's will and power are always at play. In the final stanzas, the speaker draws the reader's attention to the sights and sounds of earth and how wonderful they are to the human ear and eye. The poem concludes with a plea for all of humanity and it's construction. The speaker hopes that God will take the dust that is left behind after death and bring it to Heaven from where it originated."
413,"Clora, come view my soul, and tell Whether I have contrived it well. Now all its several lodgings lie Composed into one gallery;
And the great arras-hangings, made Of various faces, by are laid; That, for all furniture, you’ll find Only your picture in my mind.
Here thou are painted in the dress
Of an inhuman murderess; Examining upon our hearts Thy fertile shop of cruel arts: Engines more keen than ever yet Adorned a tyrant’s cabinet;
Of which the most tormenting are
Black eyes, red lips, and curlèd hair.
But, on the other side, th’art drawn Like to Aurora in the dawn;
When in the East she slumbering lies, And stretches out her milky thighs; While all the morning choir does sing, And manna falls, and roses spring; And, at thy feet, the wooing doves Sit pérfecting their harmless loves.
Like an enchantress here thou show’st, Vexing thy restless lover’s ghost; And, by a light obscure, dost rave Over his entrails, in the cave; Divining thence, with horrid care, How long thou shalt continue fair;
And (when informed) them throw’st away,
To be the greedy vulture’s prey.
But, against that, thou sit’st afloat Like Venus in her pearly boat.
The halcyons, calming all that’s nigh, Betwixt the air and water fly; Or, if some rolling wave appears, A mass of ambergris it bears.
Nor blows more wind than what may well Convoy the perfume to the smell.

Of thee my gallery do store
In all the forms thou canst invent Either to please me, or torment: For thou alone to people me, Art grown a numerous colony; And a collection choicer far
Than or Whitehall’s or Mantua’s were.
But, of these pictures and the rest,
That at the entrance likes me best: Where the same posture, and the look Remains, with which I first was took: A tender shepherdess, whose hair
Hangs loosely playing in the air, Transplanting flowers from the green hill, To crown her head, and bosom fill.","Clora, come view my soul, and tell Whether I have contrived it well.

The poem begins with the speaker inviting the reader and Clora to follow him into his soul where he has created a gallery. This gallery is filled only with images of his true love, and he hopes that she will be impressed by it. The first painting that he shows off is that of Clora as a “murderess” using her looks to charm those around her. The second shows her as Aurora the goddess of the dawn. These two contrasting images depict the intensive spot that she holds in the speaker's heart. She is both a controlling and appealing woman. This is expanded on as the speaker shows the reader a portrait of Clora as Venus, as well as an “enchantress” who is telling the future from her lover's entrails. The poem concludes with the speaker saying that these are only a few of the thousands of paintings he has and that of all of them, the original is his favorite. He most cherishes an image of his love shows her as she was when he first saw her, simple, and kind."

In this poem, Rumi expresses his antithetical ideas and how he wants his loved ones to react after he passes away. He has a positive attitude throughout the poem, though he talks about his death. The poem contains many symbols that explain the speaker's thoughts on death. It is considered that death is nothing but an “arriving at eternal love.” For the speaker, death is a doorway to heaven and eternal life waiting behind the thin veil of oblivion. It helps one to be the closest with God. Besides, the poem reflects Islamic concepts and beliefs of eternal life. According to the speaker, death appears to be like a “sunset,” but actually, it is the “dawn.”"
416,"The sun is warm, the sky is clear,
The waves are dancing fast and bright,
Blue isles and snowy mountains wear
The purple noon's transparent might,
The breath of the moist earth is light,
Around its unexpanded buds;
Like many a voice of one delight,
The winds, the birds, the ocean floods,
The City's voice itself, is soft like Solitude's.
I see the Deep's untrampled floor
With green and purple seaweeds strown;
I see the waves upon the shore,
Like light dissolved in star-showers, thrown:
I sit upon the sands alone,—
The lightning of the noontide ocean
Is flashing round me, and a tone
Arises from its measured motion,
How sweet! did any heart now share in my emotion.
Alas! I have nor hope nor health,
Nor peace within nor calm around,
Nor that content surpassing wealth
The sage in meditation found,
And walked with inward glory crowned—
Nor fame, nor power, nor love, nor leisure.
Others I see whom these surround—
Smiling they live, and call life pleasure;
To me that cup has been dealt in another measure.
Yet now despair itself is mild,
Even as the winds and waters are;
I could lie down like a tired child,
And weep away the life of care
Which I have borne and yet must bear,
Till death like sleep might steal on me,
And I might feel in the warm air
My cheek grow cold, and hear the sea
Breathe o'er my dying brain its last monotony.
Some might lament that I were cold,
As I, when this sweet day is gone,
Which my lost heart, too soon grown old,
Insults with this untimely moan;
They might lament—for I am one
Whom men love not,—and yet regret,
Unlike this day, which, when the sun
Shall on its stainless glory set,
Will linger, though enjoyed, like joy in memory yet.","The author sits on a beach in the middle of the ocean, looking out over the sea. He says he has no hope nor health, nor peace within nor calm around, nor that content surpassing wealth. But he is filled with the joys of life, and of being alone.","Stanzas Written in Dejection, near Naples' by Percy Bysshe Shelley describes the feelings of alienation a speaker suffers from and how he attempts to soothe his pain with nature. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is observing a beautiful day. The landscape around him contains both the sea and mountains and he is able to take in both. He observes everything, listening to its voice which sounds like “Solitude's.” In the next section, he looks deeper into the sea and sees the bottom of the deep. It is untouched by any human presence. Once more the elements of the scene come together and show off the true beauty of the landscape. He is there at a pristine moment in time. The next sections go into the emotional state of the narrator. He is not enlivened by the sights he sees. Instead, he meditates on his own depression. He lists all the things he does not have but wishes he did. This has led him into a dark place in his mind he cannot get out of. He feels as if the world does not care for him— he is a man alone. The final section sees the speaker attempt to improve his own mood by enjoying the moment he is living in. He understands how time passes and that this moment, if not enjoyed will go to waste just like all the others he took for granted."
417,"Tommy is three and when he's bad
his mother dances with him.
She puts on the record,
""Red Roses for a Blue Lady""
and throws him across the room.
Mind you,
she never laid a hand on him.
He gets red roses in different places,
the head, that time he was as sleepy as a river,
the back, that time he was a broken scarecrow,
the arm like a diamond had bitten it,
the leg, twisted like a licorice stick,
all the dance they did together,
Blue Lady and Tommy.
You fell, she said, just remember you fell.
I fell, is all he told the doctors
in the big hospital. A nice lady came
and asked him questions but because
he didn't want to be sent away he said, I fell.
He never said anything else although he could talk fine.
He never told about the music

of red roses he gives her","Tommy is three and when he's bad his mother dances with him. She puts on the record, ""Red Roses for a Blue Lady"" and throws him across the room. He pretends he is her ball. He tries to fold up and bounce but he squashes like fruit. He loves Blue Lady and the spots of red roses he gives her.","Red Roses by Anne Sexton is a story of child abuse told by a narrator, but with the vernacular, that represents the emotions and thoughts of the child undergoing the abuse. The word choice and imagery is so contrary to the negative phrasing a reader might expect in a story of a toddler being abused that the atmosphere of the work feels like a juxtaposition. This juxtaposition, as it happens, is one of the primary strengths of the work because it showcases the struggle of a child who loves his mother and wants to stay with her, but needs to make the situation right enough in his own mind to keep going with that love. Little Tommy, the toddler, wants to believe that things are well with his mother, though he seems to know better on a deeper level, and that concept is a driving force in the work—to the point that Sexton’s poem is sincerely haunting and heart-breaking."
418,"Silent is the house: all are laid asleep:
One alone looks out o’er the snow-wreaths deep,
Watching every cloud, dreading every breeze
That whirls the wildering drift, and bends the groaning trees.

Cheerful is the hearth, soft the matted floor;
Not one shivering gust creeps through pane or door;
The little lamp burns straight, its rays shoot strong and far:
I trim it well, to be the wanderer’s guiding-star.

Frown, my haughty sire! chide, my angry dame!
Set your slaves to spy; threaten me with shame:
But neither sire nor dame nor prying serf shall know,
What angel nightly tracks that waste of frozen snow.

What I love shall come like visitant of air,
Safe in secret power from lurking human snare;
What loves me, no word of mine shall e’er betray,
Though for faith unstained my life must forfeit pay.

Burn, then, little lamp; glimmer straight and clear—
Hush! a rustling wing stirs, methinks, the air:
He for whom I wait, thus ever comes to me;
Strange Power! I trust thy might; trust thou my constancy.","Silent is the house: all are laid asleep: one alone looks out o’er the snow-wreaths deep. The little lamp burns straight, its rays shoot strong and far: I trim it well, to be the wanderer’s guiding-star.","The Visionary' by Emily Brontë (and, to some extent, Charlotte Brontë) describes the imminent arrival of an undefined, spirit-like presence to a house in the middle of winter. The poem begins with the speaker describing how she is the only one still awake in the house. The “sire” and the “dame” are asleep. They cannot see what she's doing and even if they did, she'd reveal nothing about her intentions. There is someone she's waiting for and her lamp, that she tends assiduously, is there in the window guiding this person in. By the end of the poem it becomes clear that this visitor is nonhuman. He has a “Strange Power” and the ability to command her allegiance. He holds all the power in the relationship and she is determined to be true to him and keep his identity a secret from everyone. This is what's going to maintain their relationship. Although the full poem is quoted below, you can also read the poem here."
419,"I smiled at you because I thought that you
Were someone else; you smiled back; and there grew
Between two strangers in a library
Something that seemes like love; but you loved me

Was other than I was. And by and by
We found we'd been mistaken all the while
From that first glance, that first mistaken smile.","I smiled at you because I thought that you                Were someone else; you smiled back; and there grew something that seemes like love; but you loved me because you thought that I                Was other than I was.

The poem is simple, with only eight lines it outlines quickly and clearly the first time the two met, the relationship they thought they had, and how that turned out not to be the case. Whoever the speaker and listener are, they did not truly know one another. It becomes clear that they had misunderstood who the other person was and built their relationship on false pretenses."
420,"Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,
Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,
Silence the pianos and with muffled drum
Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.

Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead
Scribbling on the sky the message 'He is Dead'.
Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,
Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.

He was my North, my South, my East and West,
My working week and my Sunday rest,
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;
I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.

Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun,
Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;
For nothing now can ever come to any good.","Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone.Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,Silence the pianos and with muffled drumBring out the coffin, let the mourners come.Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead.Scribbling on the sky the message 'He is Dead'","Funeral Blues' by W.H. Auden is about the power of grief and the way that it influences people differently. For someone like the speaker who has suffered a loss, the world is transformed. But to everyone else, nothing changes. Time doesn't slow down, and no one cares what's happening. The indifference of the world plagues the speaker in this poem. They plead with the world to feel as they do, understand his grief, and even participate in it."
421,"Cold and final, the imagination
Shuts down its fabled summer house;
Blue views are boarded up; our sweet vacation
Dwindles in the hour-glass.

Thoughts that found a maze of mermaid hair
Tangling in the tide's green fall
Now fold their wings like bats and disappear
Into the attic of the skull.

We are not what we might be; what we are
Outlaws all extrapolation
Beyond the interval of now and here:
White whales are gone with the white ocean.

A lone beachcomber squats among the wrack
Of kaleidoscope shells
Probing fractured Venus with a stick
Under a tent of taunting gulls.

No sea-change decks the sunken shank of bone
That chucks in backtrack of the wave;
Though the mind like an oyster labors on and on,
A grain of sand is all we have.

Water will run by; the actual sun
Will scrupulously rise and set;
No little man lives in the exacting moon
And that is that, is that, is that.","Cold and final, the imagination                Shuts down its fabled summer house.                Blue views are boarded up; our sweet vacation                Dwindles in the hour-glass.                We are not what we might be; what we are is that.                Outlaws all extrapolation beyond the interval of now and here:                White whales are gone with the white ocean.                A grain of sand is all we have.","This poem takes place almost entirely in an imagined world within the speaker's head. Her “summer house” which she imagines, is a place in which she and her lover were going to be happy. This place of carefree happiness is being sealed up, windows covered and the view gone. Their time has dwindled like the sand in an hourglass. The speaker remembers how fanciful and free her thoughts used to be and that now they have retreated to the back of her head. She speaks of the nature of their relationship and how there is no way to predict what the two of them are becoming and that they are akin to white whales, gone far out in the ocean. The speaker continues on to describe her own consciousness as a beachcomber searching through her memories for something worthwhile while seagulls circle above. The poem concludes with a reality check in which she states permanent facts about the world, repeating them to herself, forcing herself to acknowledge reality and leave behind her fantasy world."
422,"Never let me lose the marvel
of your statue-like eyes, or the accent

a branchless trunk, and what I most regret

for the worm of my despair.

The poem begins with the speaker asking that no matter what happens the love between himself and another is never be lost. He wants to be able to relish his lover's eyes and breath on his “cheek” every night. The speaker is worried about losing what he has because he imagines himself as a tree without adornments on a solitary shore. This is not how he wants to live the rest of his life. In the last two stanzas, the speaker directs his words to his lover. This person has become so important to him that they have taken on the role of “master.” He is a “dog,” following and indulging his lover's every desire."
423,"My spirit is too weak—mortality
Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep,
And each imagined pinnacle and steep
Of godlike hardship tells me I must die
Like a sick eagle looking at the sky.
Yet ’tis a gentle luxury to weep
That I have not the cloudy winds to keep
Fresh for the opening of the morning’s eye.
Such dim-conceived glories of the brain

The speaker starts the poem by asserting that their spirit isn't strong enough; they are weighed down by the inevitability of death. SO much so, it feels as though they are about to fall asleep at any time. They look at the states of godlike hardship, and they know that they are going to lose their life one day. The speaker makes other comparisons, suggesting that they are like an eagle that is too sick to fly, but that gazes at the sky. They also say that these thoughts make the speaker hone in on the struggle in their heart. This is compared to the way that the Elgin Marbles make the speaker feel awestruck and in pain. They are filled with both beauty and suffering. They make the speaker, he concludes, think of the sea and sun, but at the same time, they are shadows of something else entirely."
424,"At the end of my suffering
there was a door.

Hear me out: that which you call death
I remember.

Overhead, noises, branches of the pine shifting.
Then nothing. The weak sun
flickered over the dry surface.

It is terrible to survive
as consciousness
buried in the dark earth.

Then it was over: that which you fear, being
a soul and unable
to speak, ending abruptly, the stiff earth
bending a little. And what I took to be
birds darting in low shrubs.

You who do not remember
passage from the other world
I tell you I could speak again: whatever
returns from oblivion returns
to find a voice:

from the center of my life came
a great fountain, deep blue
shadows on azure seawater.",At the end of my suffering there was a door. The weak sunflickered over the dry surface. The stiff earthbending a little. And what I took to be birds darting in low shrubs. But I could speak again: whateverreturns from oblivion returns.,"The Wild Iris' by Louise Glück is a complex and deeply metaphorical poem that describes death from the perspective of a flower. Throughout the short lines of 'The Wild Iris,' the speaker describes what it means to live, die, and be reborn again. They've gone through the cycle an endless number of times as a flower. It is a struggle that has a door at the end, a light at the end of the tunnel. They are well-versed in what it is like to be buried alive and exist without a voice and then rediscover that voice as one bends the earth. While the speaker is talking about a flower, there are obvious implications for humanity, and the human soul. It is also possible to read this poem as a depiction of a mental or emotional rebirth rather than a physical one."
425,"Stay, I said
to the cut flowers.
They bowed
their heads lower.

Stay, I said to the spider,
who fled.

Stay, leaf.
It reddened,
embarrassed for me and itself.

Stay, I said to my body.
It sat as a dog does,
obedient for a moment,
soon starting to tremble.

Stay, to the earth
of riverine valley meadows,
of fossiled escarpments,
of limestone and sandstone.
It looked back
with a changing expression, in silence.

Stay, I said to my loves.
Each answered,
Always.","Stay, I said to the cut flowers. They bowed their heads lower. Stay, to the earth.Stay, the spider, who fled. Stay to the riverine valley meadows, the fossiled escarpments, the limestone and sandstone.Stay to my loves.","The Promise by Jane Hirshfield is a reflection on how things in the poet’s life seem to drift away from her, leaving her behind. She asks objects such as ‘flowers’, a ‘spider’ and even her own ‘body’ to stay, but in the end they always leave or change. The final stanza of the poem focuses on asking lovers to stay, to which they answer ‘always’. This ending can be interpreted both positivity, in that they stay with her, or as a lie – a broken promise repeated lover after lover."
426,"The bells of waiting Advent ring,
The Tortoise stove is lit again
And lamp-oil light across the night
Has caught the streaks of winter rain
In many a stained-glass window sheen
From Crimson Lake to Hookers Green.
The holly in the windy hedge
And round the Manor House the yew
Will soon be stripped to deck the ledge,
The altar, font and arch and pew,
So that the villagers can say
'The church looks nice' on Christmas Day.
Provincial Public Houses blaze,
Corporation tramcars clang,
On lighted tenements I gaze,
Where paper decorations hang,
And bunting in the red Town Hall
Says 'Merry Christmas to you all'.
And London shops on Christmas Eve
Are strung with silver bells and flowers
As hurrying clerks the City leave
To pigeon-haunted classic towers,
And marbled clouds go scudding by
The many-steepled London sky.
And girls in slacks remember Dad,
And oafish louts remember Mum,
And sleepless children's hearts are glad.
And Christmas-morning bells say 'Come!'
Even to shining ones who dwell
Safe in the Dorchester Hotel.
And is it true? And is it true,
This most tremendous tale of all,
Seen in a stained-glass window's hue,
A Baby in an ox's stall ?
The Maker of the stars and sea
Become a Child on earth for me ?
And is it true ? For if it is,
No loving fingers tying strings
Around those tissued fripperies,
The sweet and silly Christmas things,
Bath salts and inexpensive scent
And hideous tie so kindly meant,
No love that in a family dwells,
No carolling in frosty air,
Nor all the steeple-shaking bells
Can with this single Truth compare -
That God was man in Palestine
And lives today in Bread and Wine.","The bells of waiting Advent ring, and the Tortoise stove is lit again. The stained-glass window sheen sheen from Crimson Lake to Hookers Green. The altar, font and arch and pew, will soon be stripped to deck the ledge, so that the villagers can say 'The church looks nice'","'Christmas' by John Betjeman describes the traditions of Christmas time and how they compare to the story of the birth of Christ. The poem begins with the speaker describing the lead up to Christmas and how everything in a church is decorated for Advent. These images start the poem on a cozy and familiar note. The speaker's tone is calm and peaceful, he is simply taking in the Christmas imagery. Time progresses, and the speaker moves on to examine the village itself. There are a number of buildings which are also decorated with “paper” and buntings that read “Merry Christmas to you all.” The next lines move the poem into London. There, the speaker takes note of the shops which are also decorated. They are adorned with “silver bells and flowers. This contrasts somewhat with the simple decorations of the village. In the fifth stanza, he goes through a few of the people who are called to the church on Christmas Eve. They all come, even those who live in the “Dorchester Hotel.” Stanzas six and seven contain questions. They are used to seek out the truth of the Christian Christmas story, regarding the birth of Christ in a manger. It is clear from the speaker's tone that he is already a believer, he is just using the questions as a place to start off this last section of the poem. Throughout stanzas seven and eight he compares the things that people do on Christmas, such as giving bad gifts and spending time with family to what he thinks really matters. That is the birth of Christ and giving proper time and appreciation to the story."
427,"If I were loved, as I desire to be,

And range of evil between death and birth,
That I should fear, —if I were loved by thee?

Fresh-water springs come up through bitter brine.

Below us, as far on as eye could see.","If I were loved, as I desire to be, I would not fear death. I would wait for death with joy, not fear, claspt hand-in-hand with thee. I have heard that, somewhere in the main, fresh-water springs come up through bitter brine.","“If I were loved, as I desire to be” by Alfred Lord Tennyson is a sonnet that describes how the speaker's life would be different if he was loved the way he wants to be. The poem beings with the speaker stating that he does not have the amount, or type, of love that he desires. He wants to be loved without reserve or stipulation. He believes that if he can acquire the love of one particular unnamed person, that he will be without fear. The evil of the world will be unable to reach him. The speaker describes how all the pain that exists, whether within or without, could not touch him. He would be impervious to hurt of any kind. Love would provide him with an indestructible hope that would rise past any depression or darkness. The poem concludes with the speaker describing how even if the world was to completely come to an end, and alone with her he faced his death, he would not be afraid. As long as they have their hands clasped and are able to reassure one another with their presence, they could face an oncoming torrent of destruction. Unfortunately for the speaker, this is only a dream. From this piece, the reader cannot infer whether there is any possibility of this love becoming real."

This heartfelt poem captures a girl's reaction when she steps into womanhood. Several changes occur in her life that makes her soul troubled. She finds herself caged inside a body that is portrayed as “impure” to society. Furthermore, Cofer captures her intimate feelings about the painful changes within her body. The child has to tackle the transition on her own. None consoles her instead they burden her body with womanly modifications."
429,"HE SHALL not hear the bittern cry

In the wild sky, where he is lain,

Nor voices of the sweeter birds,

Above the wailing of the rain.

Nor shall he know when loud March blows

Thro’ slanting snows her fanfare shrill,

Blowing to flame the golden cup

Of many an upset daffodil.

But when the Dark Cow leaves the moor,

And pastures poor with greedy weeds,

Lifting her horn in pleasant meads.","He shall not hear the bittern cry in the wild sky, where he is lain, nor voices of the sweeter birds, nor the wailing of the rain. But when the Dark Cow leaves the moor, he may hear her low at morn, lifting her horn in pleasant meads.","Poetic Form A lament is a song of grief for the dead. It is an old poetic form, with roots in a religious ritual. The Book of Lamentations, for example, is one of the books of the Old Testament. In Irish, there are several great lamentations, such as “Lament for Owen Roe O'Neill,” “The Hag of Beare,” and “Lament for Art O'Leary.” The rhyme scheme of Lament for Thomas MacDonagh is Xaba bcXc Xbab and the meter is iambic tetrameter. The last word of the first line in each stanza rhymes with the middle word of the second line of each stanza: 1) cry/sky, 2) blows/snows, and 3) moor/poor. In stanzas two and three, Ledwidge repeats this pattern with the third and fourth lines: cup/upset, morn/horn. Ledwidge makes use of “eye rhyme,” in the poem, a form of writing where two words look as though they should rhyme, even though they do not. An example is “cow” and “low” in stanza three. In the first stanza “sweeter birds” contains elements of the word “bittern” (bi-, -ter) and the false rhymes of “wailing” and “rain.”"
430,"Home’s the place we head for in our sleep. Boxcars stumbling north in dreams
don’t wait for us. We catch them on the run. The rails, old lacerations that we love, shoot parallel across the face and break just under Turtle Mountains. Riding scars
you can’t get lost. Home is the place they cross.
The lame guard strikes a match and makes the dark less tolerant. We watch through cracks in boards as the land starts rolling, rolling till it hurts to be here, cold in regulation clothes.
We know the sheriff’s waiting at midrun
to take us back. His car is dumb and warm.
The highway doesn’t rock, it only hums
like a wing of long insults. The worn-down welts of ancient punishments lead back and forth.
All runaways wear dresses, long green ones,
the color you would think shame was. We scrub the sidewalks down because it's shameful work. Our brushes cut the stone in watered arcs and in the soak frail outlines shiver clear
a moment, things us kids pressed on the dark face before it hardened, pale, remembering
delicate old injuries, the spines of names and leaves.","Home’s the place we head for in our sleep. Boxcars stumbling north in dreams don’t wait for us. We catch them on the run.

The poem is part dream and part reality. The young speaker describes a failed effort to escape from the boarding school. It starts with the children jumping on a train and briefly riding it. They look outside and admire the landscape, noting how scarred and changed it is. When they get to a stopping point, the sheriff picks them up and returns them. This is something, the speaker alludes, that has happened before and will likely happen again. Back at the school, they do “shameful” work and consider their ancestors. Despite what they've suffered, there is still hope in their hearts, keeping them strong."

Rife with Christian imagery, and pulling much inspiration from apocalyptic writing, Yeats’ ‘The Second Coming’ tries to put into words what countless people of the time felt: that it was the end of the world as they knew it and that nothing else would ever be the same again. The First World War had shaken the foundations of knowledge for many, and scarred from the knowledge of the ‘war to end all wars’, they could no longer reconcile themselves with a time before the Great War. This poem is the literary version of that: a lack of ability to think of a time before the war."
432,"To stare at nothing is to learn by heart
What all of us will be swept into, and baring oneself
To the wind is feeling the ungraspable somewhere close by.
Trees can sway or be still. Day or night can be what they wish.
What we desire, more than a season or weather, is the comfort
Of being strangers, at least to ourselves. This is the crux
Of the matter, which is why even now we seem to be waiting
For something whose appearance would be its vanishing—
The sound, say, of a few leaves falling, or just one leaf,
Or less. There is no end to what we can learn. The book out there
Tells us as much, and was never written with us in mind.","To stare at nothing is to learn by heart what all of us will be swept into, and baring oneself is feeling the ungraspable somewhere close by.

The poem starts with contemplation of “nothing” and humanity's interaction with the natural world. As it progresses, the language gets more complicated. The speaker discusses how “us,” meaning humanity, want to see ourselves as strangers. This element of mystery is expanded as they discuss how the world was not “written with us in mind.”"
433,"Endlessly, time-honoured irritant,
A bubble is restively forming at your tip.
Burst it as fast as we can –
It will grow again until we begin dying.

Silently it inflates, till we’re enclosed
And forced to start the struggle to get out:
Bestial, intent, real.
The wet spark comes, the bright blown walls collapse,

But what sad scapes we cannot turn from then:
What ashen hills! what salted, shrunken lakes!
How leaden the ring looks,
Birmingham magic all discredited,


And how remote that bare and sunscrubbed room,
Intensely far, that padlocked cube of light
We neither define nor prove,
Where you, we dream, obtain no right of entry.","Endlessly, time-honoured irritant, the bubble is restively forming at your tip. Burst it as fast as we can –                It will grow again until we begin dying. The wet spark comes, the bright blown walls collapse. But what sad scapes we cannot turn from then.","Dry-Point' by Philip Larkin speaks on the complexities of sexual encounters and the primal way humans are controlled by desire. The poem begins with the speaker describing sex as something that is both an irritant and a constant. There is no escaping it. One is forced to endure it in cycles and as frustration grows, a “bubble” appears. This bubble represents the rapid way in which emotions can change, as well as their delicate nature. The speaker goes on to describe how the bubble grows around himself and his listener. Together they become enclosed in it. Trapped with one another in a strange prison of love and lust. The only thing they can do is give in to their “Bestial” intent. In the next lines, he states that whenever he has sex, it always seems as if it is leading somewhere great, but that's never the case. He always ends up disappointed and looking at a “sad scape,” or poor emotional landscape. His bad memories of the encounters only last so long. Then he is ready to throw off the “irritant” once more. The poem concludes with the speaker thinking about a bright, bare room that has been burnt clean and emptied by the sun. This place contrasts with the dark “ashen hills” of the previous stanza. It is to this “padlocked” room the speaker would like to travel. Unfortunately for him, and for all of humanity represented by his plight, there is no way into this utopia."
434,"IN 1492
In fourteen hundred ninety-two
Columbus sailed the ocean blue.
He had three ships and left from Spain;
He sailed through sunshine, wind and rain.
He sailed by night; he sailed by day;
He used the stars to find his way.
A compass also helped him know
How to find the way to go.
Ninety sailors were on board;
Some men worked while others snored.
Then the workers went to sleep;
And others watched the ocean deep.
Day after day they looked for land;
They dreamed of trees and rocks and sand.
October 12 their dream came true,
You never saw a happier crew!
""Indians! Indians!"" Columbus cried;
His heart was filled with joyful pride.
But ""India"" the land was not;
It was the Bahamas, and it was hot.
The Arakawa natives were very nice;
They gave the sailors food and spice.
Columbus sailed on to find some gold
To bring back home, as he'd been told.
He made the trip again and again,
Trading gold to bring to Spain.
The first American? No, not quite.
But Columbus was brave, and he was bright.

He came to a new land,
He came to a new land,
Columbus sailed across the sea,
And came to a new land.

Then sailed back home to Spain.

In the first lines of 'In 1492' (Columbus sailed the ocean blue), the speaker begins with the lines that most American schoolchildren learn in order to remember the date that Columbus first stumbled upon the New World. The stanzas go on to describe the ships that arrived there, Columbus and his crew's joy upon finding “Indians” and their meeting with the “Arakawa” natives."
435,"The Camel's hump is an ugly lump
Which well you may see at the Zoo;
But uglier yet is the hump we get
From having too little to do.
Kiddies and grown-ups too-oo-oo,
If we haven't enough to do-oo-oo,
We get the hump—
Cameelious hump—
The hump that is black and blue!
We climb out of bed with a frouzly head,
And a snarly-yarly voice. We shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl
At our bath and our boots and our toys;
And there ought to be a corner for me
(And I know' there is one for you)
When we get the hump—
Cameelious hump—
The hump that is black and blue!
The cure for this ill is not to sit still,
Or frowst with a book by the fire;
But to take a large hoe and a shovel also,
And dig till you gently perspire;
And then you will find that the sun and the wind,
And the Djinn of the Garden too,
Have lifted the hump—
The horrible hump—

We shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl.","'The Camel's Hump' by Rudyard Kipling is a fun verse on the consequences of laziness that is growing a “Cameelious hump” on our backs. In the poem 'The Camel's Hump,' Kipling draws similarities between lazy humans and a camel. The camel's hump has been taken into a negative light, calling it “uglier” to sight. Its hump is seen as a metaphor for being inactive and sluggish. Doing nothing is a sheer waste of time and energy. According to the poet, the person who sits back doing nothing productive is unpleasant to the sight, just like the “Cameelious hump.” The poet thus conveys the message to be active, involved in things, be innovative, and never stop to make oneself better and the best."
436,"It was a mighty monarch's child,
Her cheek was pale, her eye was wild;
Beneath a linden's shade I press'd
The maiden to my panting breast.

"" I will not have thy father's throne,
I will not have his golden crown,
I will not have his realm so wide,
I will have thee, and nought beside. ""

"" That cannot be, "" the maiden said,
"" Because I am already dead;
And but by night the sods above
I burst for thee, and thy dear love. ""","It was a mighty monarch's child, her cheek was pale, her eye was wild. ""I will have thee, and nought beside,"" I said. ""That cannot be, "" the maiden said, ""because I am already dead"" ""And but by night the sods above, and thy dear love, I burst for thee, "" he said.","'Giant Decorative Dahlias' by Molly Holden describes an impossible relationship between two speakers through a conceit comparing the woman to a dahlia. The poem begins with the speaker stating that the woman is “a mighty monarch's child”. This references a higher being, perhaps God, a king, or the power of the natural world, which one cannot control. They are together under a tree, in a natural setting. The speaker held “The maiden” to their “panting breast.” In the second stanza, the speaker tells the woman that he intends to “have” her, but doesn't want any part of the woman's father's kingdom. He does not want to be king, have land, or wear a crown. The poem concludes with the woman having her say. She tells her partner that this is impossible. The only time they can be together is when she breaks through “the sod.” Here it becomes clear how Holden is using the flower to symbolize the temporary, yet strong nature of their love. The woman blooms, and then dies. In fact, she states that she is already dead, emphasizing the impossibility of their relationship."
437,"Alack, what poverty my muse brings forth,
That, having such a scope to show her pride,
The argument all bare is of more worth
Than when it hath my added praise beside.

That overgoes my blunt invention quite,
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.

To mar the subject that before was well?

Than of your graces and your gifts to tell.
 And more, much more, than in my verse can sit

And more, much more, than in my verse can sit with you. Your own glass shows you when you look in it.","'Sonnet 103' by William Shakespeare describes how useless and feeble words are to describe his love for the Fair Youth. The speaker spends the lines of this poem describing how his poetry doesn't do justice to the young man's beauty. He feels depressed and exhausted by the fact that no matter what he comes up with, he'd immediately be outdone by the Youth's reflection in his glass, or mirror. The speaker has pretty much come to terms with this fact, but he continues to return to it in various ways throughout this series."

The first three stanzas follow this format, each year Koch's appreciation for the city he has arrived into changing, focusing on features of a different season and emotions in each stanza. It seems that it is within the third year of being in this new city that Koch finds a partner. Yet, while incredibly passionate, depicted through the metaphor of a lit match, their relationship eventually burns out. His partner ignites him, while he seems to slow them down with him 'somnambular' way of life. Although they were together for a 'year', it seems that they were not right for each other, eventually separating. Yet, the emotions and memories they shared live on, the final line revealing the innate connection between the past lovers."

It was written the year before he passed away. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker, who is commonly considered to be Yeats himself, begins by describing a young girl. He's unwilling to turn himself towards the world's politics, engage with them, and ignore this symbolic woman. He discusses a man, a politician, and what it would be like to be young again. The poem concludes with a statement of longing that suggests that inner experiences outweigh his interest in the broader world."

In the first lines of 'The Gardener LXI: Peace, My Heart,' the speaker begins by addressing his heart and the nature of death. It's inevitable, and therefore not worth worrying about. Rather than fighting it, the speaker alludes, one should enter into it like a bird or a flower, with the “folding of the wings.” He speaks to “you” in the second half of the poem, encouraging “you” to take into consideration everything he's said and offering to light this listener's way into the next life."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that “they” are returning. The gods are tentative in their steps as if they are unsure how to proceed. They sway and have trouble walking. It is immediately clear they do not have some strength they used to. This is only emphasized in the next lines as the speaker remembers what they, and their “silver hounds” used to be like. They had a strength that was unmatched and a ferocity to be feared. 'The Return' concludes with the gods remaining in their “pallid” and sick form. In the speaker's eyes, they will never have the power they used to."

Thighs, hair;
Flakes from my heels.

Dead hands, dead stringencies.

The poem begins with a calm “stasis” in which nothing is happening until the horse, “Ariel,” throws herself headlong into a charge. The speaker is holding on for dear life, unable to grasp her neck. The hills and landmarks of the countryside are pouring past them. As she rides, she begins to lose pieces of herself, she is shedding her past life and “stringencies” and becoming something new. She is merging with Ariel and becoming the “arrow” that will take her to a new life. The poem ends with the two charging on into the burning sun/future that awaits them."

The poem begins with the speaker asking “April,” the month usually associated with the spring season, why it has to come back. Beauty, she notes, is not enough of a reason. There is a fictional aspect in this beauty that bothers the speaker. She knows that it's not the truth. There is far more death and decay under the surface. The speaker describes spring as an “idiot” in the last few lines of the poem."
444,"The last of last words spoken is, Good-bye -
The last dismantled flower in the weed-grown hedge,
The last thin rumour of a feeble bell far ringing,
The last blind rat to spurn the mildewed rye.

A hardening darkness glasses the haunted eye,
Shines into nothing the watcher's burnt-out candle,
Wreathes into scentless nothing the wasting incense,
Faints in the outer silence the hunting-cry.

Thought in her ivory tower gropes in her spinning,
Toss on in vain the whispering trees of Eden,

A hardening darkness glasses the haunted eye, the watcher's burnt-out candle, the wasting incense.","This hauntingly and lyrically touching piece of Walter de la Mare is about the “last of last words,” “Goodbye,” and how it affects a listener. De la Mare paints the impression of the parting words a person will ever speak, “Goodbye.” His persona compares the void these words create by comparing it to the “last dismantled flower” in a weed-grown fence or noise so faint that it is barely audible. The speaker then describes the emptiness that remains after these words are spoken, like darkness hovering over the haunted eyes or candles burning out into nothingness. The feeling of obscurity is evident throughout the poem. In the end, de la Mare describes how the person's absence wreaks havoc in his mind by the line, “Toss on in vain the whispering trees of Eden.” Overall, he creates an intricate image of the emotional toll the last words of a person take and the silence and emptiness that follows after their abrupt departure."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that “Love” has left her and in it's wake is the inescapable sameness of the days. She no longer knows how to live her life and must force herself to eat and start her day. As soon as she is awake she is ready for night to fall, but when she finally gets in bed, she is unable to sleep. This pattern is repeating itself over and over. In the second stanza the speaker states how she no longer knows what she is supposed to do everyday, and that anything she does attempt to do, she gets bored of quickly. She feels as if there is no point to finishing anything she starts. Finally, the narrator describes how her neighbors are spying on her and hoping to find out what happened in her life. She feels a deep depression about the state of the world she is living in. She does not want to have to deal with “to-morrow and to-morrow.”"

The poem begins with the speaker on a boat, sailing through the dark waters of the sea. It is unclear at first if there is a point to his travels or if he is just moving aimlessly through the landscape. He takes note of the moon, which is only half-full. This provides him with just enough light to see the land in the distance. It is not enough for him to make out any distinct features. This does not bother the speaker—making it likely he has taken this trip before. Thereafter, he makes it to land and is welcomed by the “slushy sand” in which he leaves his boat. He makes his way across fields until a farmhouse is visible in the distance. Upon reaching its window he taps on the glass and is rewarded with the spark of a match and the voice of his lover. The two can meet in secret in the final line."

The poem begins with the speaker using two short words to describe the atmosphere, “The calm.” This phrase speaks to the atmosphere the speaker experienced and that in the poem itself. The speaker describes how he stood before a river and looked down into its waters. 'Suicide's Note' concludes with the river's “Cool face,” asking the speaker “for a kiss.” It is unclear whether or not he accepted, but considering the title, he most likely did."

Illumed by Heaven's refulgent lights;
There seasons, years, unnoticed roll,

The speaker of ‘To a Star’ spends the poem gazing into the night sky considering the place of the star on the brow of heaven. She imagines what it’s like to be in heaven, how time passes as well as how the angels play music and create shelter. The star resides in a place that she would very much, if her soul were free, like to be. She determines at the end of the poem that she’s going to head straight there when she can."
449,"The rain set early in to-night,
The sullen wind was soon awake,
It tore the elm-tops down for spite,
And did its worst to vex the lake:
I listened with heart fit to break.
When glided in Porphyria; straight
She shut the cold out and the storm,
And kneeled and made the cheerless grate
Blaze up, and all the cottage warm;
Which done, she rose, and from her form
Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl,
And laid her soiled gloves by, untied
Her hat and let the damp hair fall,
And, last, she sat down by my side
And called me. When no voice replied,
She put my arm about her waist,
And made her smooth white shoulder bare,
And all her yellow hair displaced,
And, stooping, made my cheek lie there,
And spread, o'er all, her yellow hair,
Murmuring how she loved me — she
Too weak, for all her heart's endeavour,
To set its struggling passion free
From pride, and vainer ties dissever,
And give herself to me for ever.
But passion sometimes would prevail,
Nor could to-night's gay feast restrain
A sudden thought of one so pale
For love of her, and all in vain:
So, she was come through wind and rain.
Be sure I looked up at her eyes
Happy and proud; at last I knew
Porphyria worshipped me; surprise
Made my heart swell, and still it grew
While I debated what to do.
That moment she was mine, mine, fair,
Perfectly pure and good: I found
A thing to do, and all her hair
In one long yellow string I wound
Three times her little throat around,
And strangled her. No pain felt she;
I am quite sure she felt no pain.
As a shut bud that holds a bee,
I warily oped her lids: again
Laughed the blue eyes without a stain.
And I untightened next the tress
About her neck; her cheek once more
Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss:
I propped her head up as before,
Only, this time my shoulder bore
Her head, which droops upon it still:
The smiling rosy little head,
So glad it has its utmost will,
That all it scorned at once is fled,
And I, its love, am gained instead!
Porphyria's love: she guessed not how
Her darling one wish would be heard.
And thus we sit together now,
And all night long we have not stirred,
And yet God has not said a word!","The rain set early in to-night, and the sullen wind tore the elm-tops down for spite. When Porphyria glided in she shut the cold out and the storm, kneeled and made the cheerless grate                Blaze up, and all the cottage warm. When no voice replied, she put my arm about her waist, and made her smooth white shoulder bare, with all her yellow hair displaced.","Robert Browning’s poem, ‘Porphyria’s Lover,’ opens up with a classic setting. It’s a stormy evening. The rain and the wind are harsh. The speaker is alone in a small cottage. Suddenly, a woman enters, bringing cheer and warmth in the midst of the dark and cold night. It seems like a classic love poem, but when the tone shifts and the speaker does the unthinkable, it leaves the reader questioning everything from the authority of the speaker to the reality of his descriptions. The woman’s voice is not heard, and the reader is forced to draw conclusions from the voice of a speaker who proves to be less than trustworthy."
450,"The bears are kept by hundreds within fences, are fed cracked
Eggs; the weakest are
Slaughtered and fed to the others after being scented
With the blood of deer brought to the pastures by Elizabeth’s
Men—the blood spills from deep pails with bottoms of slate.

The balding Queen had bear gardens in London and in the country.
The bear is baited: the nostrils
Are blown full with pepper, the Irish wolf dogs
Are starved, then, emptied, made crazy with fermented barley:

And the bear’s hind leg is chained to a stake, the bear
Is blinded and whipped, kneeling in his own blood and slaver, he is
Almost instantly worried by the dogs. At the very moment that
Elizabeth took Essex’s head, a giant brown bear
Stood in the gardens with dogs hanging from his fur. . .
He took away the sun, took
A wolfhound in his mouth, and tossed it into
The white lap of Elizabeth I—arrows and staves rained

On his chest, and standing, he, then, stood even taller, seeing
Into the Queen’s private boxes—he grinned
Into her battered eggshell face.
Another volley of arrows and poles, and opening his mouth
He showered
Blood all over Elizabeth and her Privy Council.

The very next evening, a cool evening, the Queen demanded
Thirteen bears and the justice of 113 dogs: she slept

All that Sunday night and much of the next morning.
Some said she was guilty of this and that.
The Protestant Queen gave the defeated bear
A grave in a Catholic cemetery. The marker said:
Peter, a Solstice Bear, a gift of the Tsarevitch to Elizabeth.

After a long winter she had the grave opened. The bear’s skeleton
Was cleared with lye, she placed it at her bedside,
Put a candle inside behind the sockets of the eyes, and, then
She spoke to it:

You were a Christmas bear—behind your eyes
I see the walls of a snow cave where you are a cub still smelling
Of your mother’s blood which has dried in your hair; you have
Troubled a Queen who was afraid
When seated in shade which, standing,
You had created! A Queen who often wakes with a dream
Of you at night—
Now, you’ll stand by my bed in your long white bones; alone, you
Will frighten away at night all visions of bear, and all day
You will be in this cold room—your constant grin,
You’ll stand in the long, white prodigy of your bones, and you are,

Every inch of you, a terrible vision, not bear, but virgin!","The Queen had bear gardens in London and in the country. The bears are kept by hundreds within fences, are fed cracked eggs and fermented barley. The weakest are slaughtered and fed to the others after being scented with the blood of deer. At the very moment that Elizabeth took Essex’s head, a giant brown bear stood in the gardens with dogs hanging from his fur.","'Elizabeth's War with the Christmas Bear' by Norman Dubie is an interesting and memorable poem about how Queen Elizabeth I survived an attack by a bear. The poem opens with a description of the horrible conditions the bear and dogs endured. Both were tormented and baited, ensuring they were violent. At one point, one of the bears, later named Peter (a gift from the Russian royal family), turns on the Queen and starts to make moves towards her box. The bear is shot down, and the Queen honors it with a burial. She later digs it up, has its bones bleached, and keeps it by her bed with candles in its eyes. It reminds her of herself in the end."
451,"except it doesn't anymore.
A deserted mothership
becalmed on the valley's floor,
sheep passing through the car park,

in the lifting bays, locking out elbows,
rolling a bicep up an arm then away,

to the benediction of a lateral pull.

When he might captured the victor's cup.

In the first stanzas of this poem, the speaker admits that things are going to seem “low” at points in one's life. One might want to be happy but also have to deal with negative circumstances out of their control. On these occasions, he says, “rest if you must, but don't you quit.” As the lines progress, the speaker includes several vague descriptions of people who have struggled, quit without knowing how close they were to success. The poem ends on the same note in which it began, inspiring readers to stick through the fight even when “you're hardest hit.”"
453,"There it was I saw what I shall never forget
And never retrieve.
Monstrous and beautiful to human eyes, hard to
believe,
He lay, yet there he lay,
Asleep on the moss, his head on his polished cleft
small ebony hoves,
The child of the doe, the dappled child of the deer.

Surely his mother had never said, ""Lie here
Till I return,"" so spotty and plain to see
On the green moss lay he.
His eyes had opened; he considered me.

I would have given more than I care to say
To thrifty ears, might I have had him for my friend
One moment only of that forest day:


Might I have had the acceptance, not the love
Of those clear eyes;
Might I have been for him in the bough above
Or the root beneath his forest bed,
A part of the forest, seen without surprise.

Was it alarm, or was it the wind of my fear lest he
depart
That jerked him to his jointy knees,
And sent him crashing off, leaping and stumbling
On his new legs, between the stems of the white
trees?","There it was I saw what I shall never forget and never retrieve.                Monstrous and beautiful to human eyes, hard to believe.                Surely his mother had never said, ""Lie here hereTill I return,"" so spotty and plain to see.                On the green moss lay he.

The poem begins with the speaker vaguely describing an encounter she had with a deer. The importance of the memory is clear from the beginning. It is something she doesn't expect to ever happen again and this gives the tone a distinct sadness. In the next lines, she describes what it was like to come upon the deer. She was surprised to see him there, by himself in the moss. His mother was not around and she wondered why this is the case. In the last two stanzas, the speaker conveys her desire to be accepted by the deer and allowed to exist alongside him. She doesn't want to be loved, she just wants to be a part of the ecosystem. The poem concludes with a long question. The deer suddenly becomes alarmed and runs from the speaker. She is bothered by this turn of events because she can't figure out what she did wrong."

Merwin is a short, haunting poem in which the poet describes what darkness is and how it relates to his mother's losses. In the first lines of this poem, the poet describes blueberries at night, the taste of the experience, and what he learned from his mother. She told him directly that he's not “afraid of the dark.” Instead, he learned over time, people are afraid of deeper, all-consuming loss such as that which his mother experienced throughout her life. She lost almost all the important people in her life, defining for the poet what there truly is to fear. She knew that the dark wasn't what one should be afraid of."
455,"With thick strokes of ink the sky fills with rain.

He tells them that it's time to learn a lesson. Over the following stanzas, he brings out multiple weapons, killing everyone in his classroom.

458,"A noiseless patient spider,

It launch’d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,
Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.

The poem depicts a spider that is isolated in space but actively sending filaments ""out of itself,"" seeking connection as it builds its web. This spider becomes an extended metaphor for the speaker’s soul, which is likewise isolated and working to find a sense of connection. Ultimately, the poem suggests that in spite of the loneliness people might experience as individuals, the work of the soul is to constantly seek and make connections—however daunting such a task may be."
459,"I met a traveller from an antique land,
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
And on the pedestal, these words appear:

Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!

Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”","I met a traveller from an antique land, who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone                Stand in the desert....

Shelley describes a traveler's reaction to the half-buried, worn-out statue of the great pharaoh, Ramses II. In this poem, the speaker describes meeting a traveler “from an antique land.” The title, 'Ozymandias,' notifies the reader that this land is most probably Egypt since Ozymandias was what the Greeks called Ramses II. He was a great and terrible pharaoh in ancient Egypt. The traveler tells a story to the speaker. In the story, he describes visiting Egypt. There, he saw a large and intimidating statue of Ramses in the desert. He can tell that the sculptor must have known his subject well because it is obvious from the statue's face that this man was a great leader, but one who could also be very vicious. He describes his sneer as having a “cold command.” Even though the leader was probably very great, it seems that the only thing that survives from his realm is this statue, which is half-buried and somewhat falling apart."

The poet begins by requesting the camps to be quiet in honor of their lost commander. He wants the soldiers to retire and drape the weapons, as the war is done. Despite the sorrow that was befallen by the death of Abraham Lincoln, he brings in a positive note when he says that his commander has no worries about victory or defeat. Further, he states that he doesn't have to worry about the dark times of the war. Considering all these he wants 'the poet' (a soldier or an appeal to himself) to sing a song as they slide down the body of Lincoln to bury. He prefers a soldier from the camp to sing a song, for he knows Lincoln better than anyone."
461,"HOW wisely Nature did decree,
With the same eyes to weep and see ;
That, having viewed the object vain,
They might be ready to complain !
And, since the self-deluding sight
In a false angle takes each height,
These tears, which better measure all,
Like watery lines and plummets fall.
Two tears, which sorrow long did weigh
Within the scales of either eye,
And then paid out in equal poise,
Are the true price of all my joys.
What in the world most fair appears,
Yea, even laughter, turns to tears ;
And all the jewels which we prize
Melt in these pendants of the eyes.
I have through every garden been,
Amongst the red, the white, the green,
And yet from all the flowers I saw,
No honey, but these tears could draw.
So the all-seeing sun each day
Distils the world with chymic ray ;
But finds the essence only showers,
Which straight in pity back he pours.
Yet happy they whom grief doth bless,
That weep the more, and see the less ;
And, to preserve their sight more true,
Bathe still their eyes in their own dew.
So Magdalen in tears more wise
Dissolved those captivating eyes,
Whose liquid chains could flowing meet
To fetter her Redeemer's feet.
Not full sails hasting loaden home,
Nor the chaste lady's pregnant womb,
Nor Cynthia teeming shows so fair
As two eyes swollen with weeping are.
The sparkling glance that shoots desire,
Drenched in these waves, does lose its fire ;
Yea oft the Thunderer pity takes,
And here the hissing lightning slakes.
The incense was to Heaven dear,
Not as a perfume, but a tear ;
And stars shew lovely in the night,
But as they seem the tears of light.
Ope then, mine eyes, your double sluice,
And practise so your noblest use ;
For others too can see, or sleep,
But only human eyes can weep.
Now, like two clouds dissolving, drop,
And at each tear in distance stop ;
Now, like two fountains, trickle down ;
Now, like two floods, o'erturn and drown :
Thus let your streams o'erflow your springs,
Till eyes and tears be the same things ;
And each the other's difference bears,
These weeping eyes, those seeing tears.","Two tears, which sorrow long did weighWithin the scales of either eye, are paid out in equal poise. The all-seeing sun each dayDistils the world with chymic ray ; But finds the essence only showers, which straight in pity back he pours.","The poem, ‘Eyes and Tears‘ by Andrew Marvell is also metaphysical by virtue of its unusual imagery and its metaphors which are both ingenious and just. There is, for instance; the image of tears which better measure tings and which are therefore like the plumb-lines by means of which the depth of water is measured. Then there is the metaphysical image of two tears which have long been weighed by Sorrow within the scales of the eyes, and then been “paid out in equal poise”. Highly metaphysical is the conceit according to which the all-seeing sun each day extracts the essence of this world in the form of moisture which then returns to the earth in the shape of rain-drops which are here regarded as the tears of the sun. However, the Biblical image of Magdalen bathing the feet of Jesus Christ with her tears is not metaphysical but it is valuable in deepening the pathos of Eyes and Tears. There is a metaphysical conceit in the comparison of the copious human tears with broad rivers of overflowing their banks. There is a fanciful picture in the lines where the poet tells us that even the destructive lighting which belongs to Jove gets extinguished in his tears of pity. Then there are a number of images that are partly fanciful but mainly realistic. You can check this kind of image in the lines describing the beauty of eyes swollen with weeping. The beauty of such eyes, the readers are told, is greater than that of the sails of a ship on the homeward run, than that of a pregnant housewife, later than that of the full moon. Perfectly realistic but presented in a highly imaginative manner is the image of the lust of a man dissolving in his tears."
462,"‘Tis true, ‘tis day, what though it be?
O wilt thou therefore rise from me?
Why should we rise because ‘tis light?
Did we lie down because ‘twas night?

Should in despite of light keep us together.

And that I loved my heart and honour so,
That I would not from him, that had them, go.

Admit, but not the busied man.

The poem begins with the speaker asking several questions regarding her partner's interpretation of sunrise. She doesn't feel that just because the sun has come up that he should leave their bed. She sees the sun as lacking the ability to control what they do. But, the man rises and starts his day, reengaging with the work that keeps his focus all the time. As the poem concludes, she compares herself to a mistress. She's always going to come after his business."
463,"I sing this song, full of sadness,
this song which is myself. I will tell, what I am able,
about what hardships I have faced—since I grew up,
recently or long ago, never more than now.
Always I suffer my misery of exile.
First my lord departed from my people,
over waves rolling; I had grief before dawn
thinking of the lands which held him, my people’s lord.
Then I set out, a friendless stranger, searching
for his retinue, because of my grievous need.
Relatives of this man began to plan
through secret thought that they would separate us,
that we as far apart as possible in the kingdom of the world
would live, wretchedly, and me longing.
My lord commanded me to take a grove for a house:
little of what is beloved to me did I possess in this country,
no loyal friends; for that is my mind’s sadness.
When I found the man who was my complete match,
he was unfortunate, sad of mind and heart,
with thoughts concealed, planning his crime
behind a joyful demeanor. Very often we vowed
that we would never be separated, not by death
or anything else; what was before is now changed,
is now as if it never were, that friendship
between us. Must I who desires you nearby
suffer, my dearly loved, this feud?
Commanded was I to dwell in a forest grove.
Under an oak tree, in a cave—the earth’s chest.
Old is this earth hall and I am filled with longing.
Here is a gloomy valley, treacherous hills,
bitter hedges, briars waxing, overgrown
in this house without joy. Very often my cruel departure
takes hold of me. Friends live on earth
lying in bed with their beloveds
while I in the time before dawn alone walk
under oak tree. In the earth’s chest
I sit many long summer days
weeping for the misery of exile
my many hardships; there I am never able
to rest from my mind’s grief
nor from all the longing that in this life takes hold of me.
It may be that he is always sorrowful,
his heart’s thoughts stern; perhaps he has
a joyful demeanor next to his grief,
its constant sorrowful tumult. Whether he is dependent on himself
for all of his worldly joy, or whether he is an outcast, very far
from his distant country, sitting
under stone cliffs frost-rimmed from storms,
friendless, water flowing before
his echoing home, my lover suffers
much grief of the mind. Too often he remembers
a house full of joy. Woe to those that must
of longing in life abide.","I will tell, what I am able, about what hardships I have faced—since I grew up,ipientrecently or long ago, never more than now.Always I suffer my misery of exile.

Depending on how one interprets the poem, that departure might refer to his death, his betrayal of her, or his travels to another country. There is evidence for all of these possible solutions to her vaguely defined grief. As the poem progresses, the speaker explains how deeply depressed she is by her circumstances. She's alone, without friends or family, and eventually forced to live in a hole or cave in the ground. “They,” likely the husband's kinsmen, are trying to keep her from finding her husband, whatever that means depending on the interpretation. Now, she has to spend the rest of her days with nothing but unhappiness on her mind. In the last lines, it appears that she's wishing the same sorrow on her husband."
464,"In this dream my grandfather
comes to comfort me.
He stands apart
silent
and in his face I see
the patience of his trees
on hot typhoid days
that promise no rain.

His eyes
the color of a crow’s feather in children’s mud,
yet filled with sharp mountain-top light.

I’m sure this was the face the true bald man,
Gandhiji saw when he confessed
about the Harijan girl, the six-year-old
he adopted and tried to educate.
I’m sure these were the eyes the true hermaphrodite,
Gandhiji saw while he explained
how this girl cared too much for clothes,
how one day she went and had her hair bobbed,
the latest fashion, she said.
It was too much.
She had to be set straight,
the sooner the better.
So he had her head shaved
to teach her
not to look in mirrors so often.
At this point Gandhiji turned
towards my grandfather and allowed, so softly:
“But she cried.
I couldn’t stop her crying.
She didn’t touch dinner.
She cried all night.
I brought her to my room,
tucked her in my bed, sang her bhajans,
but she still cried.
I stayed awake beside her.
So this morning I can’t think clearly,
I can’t discuss our plans
for building schools in villages.”
And my grandfather
looked at him with the same face
he shows in my dream.","In this dream my grandfather comes to comfort me. His eyes are the color of a crow’s feather in children's mud, yet filled with sharp mountain-top light.

This poem is about the personality of the speaker, Sujata Bhatt's grandfather, Nanabhai Bhatt. Old Bhatt appears in her dream as a patient, wise, and optimistic figure. The speaker discusses one incident of Gandhiji meeting her grandfather about a six-year-old girl whom he adopted. Gandhi in order to teach her a lesson about personal looks hurt the girl. When he came to the speaker's grandfather to express his trouble, he stood before him in a silent and composed fashion. Whenever the speaker dreams of her grandfather, she sees him in this old, familiar posture."

Cummings is a very complex, yet strikingly powerful love poem that plays with the English language. Throughout the stanzas of this piece, Cummings repeats a general pattern of lines with parentheses, repeated structures, and words. It takes quite a while, at least four stanzas, to get into this pattern and start to understand what Cummings, or at least his speaker, was wanting to convey. He emphasizes throughout the stanzas the nature of “one” and how it is a representative of the strength and importance of his relationship with the intended listener of the poem. He uses bird and book-related images to convey his opinion that knowledge is better gained from love and nature than it is from the written word."
466,"The dim sea glints chill. The white sun is shy,
And the skeleton weeds and the never-dry,
Rough, long grasses keep white with frost
At the hilltop by the finger-post;
The smoke of the traveller’s-joy is puffed
Over hawthorn berry and hazel tuft.
I read the sign. Which way shall I go?
A voice says: You would not have doubted so
At twenty. Another voice gentle with scorn
Says: At twenty you wished you had never been born.

One hazel lost a leaf of gold
From a tuft at the tip, when the first voice told
The other he wished to know what ’twould be
To be sixty by this same post. “You shall see,”
He laughed—and I had to join his laughter—
“You shall see; but either before or after,
Whatever happens, it must befall,
A mouthful of earth to remedy all
Regrets and wishes shall freely be given;
And if there be a flaw in that heaven
’Twill be freedom to wish, and your wish may be
To be here or anywhere talking to me,
No matter what the weather, on earth,
At any age between death and birth,
To see what day or night can be,
The sun and the frost, the land and the sea,
Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring,—
With a poor man of any sort, down to a king,
Standing upright out in the air
Wondering where he shall journey, O where?”","The traveller’s-joy is puffed over hawthorn berry and hazel tuft. “You shall see,” he says, “but either before or after, it must befall” “With a poor man of any sort, down to a king, standing upright out in the air, O where?”","The Sign-Post' by Edward Thomas contains a discussion within a speaker's mind about the progression of time and the nature of Heaven. The poem begins with the speaker describing the scene on top of a hill beside a sign-post. It is cold, and the surrounding plant life is mostly dead. Here the speaker wonders which direction he should travel in and is confronted by two opposing voices, presumably within his own head. One mocks him for not knowing and becoming timid with age. The other reminds him that youth is not the only thing in life to be valued. The second voice takes control of the narrative in. It describes how one is going to age whether they want to or not. Eventually one will make their way to heaven where they will look down on the hard days on earth and miss them. They will long for the seasons of winter and spring and the uncertainty of daily life."
467,"Ay, gaze upon her rose-wreathed hair,
And gaze upon her smile;
Seem as you drank the very air
Her breath perfumed the while:

And wake for her the gifted line,
That wild and witching lay,
And swear your heart is as a shrine,
That only owns her sway.

Avenged they well may be—

By the nights pass’d in sleepless care,
The days of endless woe;
All that you taught my heart to bear,
All that yourself will know.

I would not wish to see you laid
Within an early tomb;
I should forget how you betray’d,
And only weep your doom:

But this is fitting punishment,
To live and love in vain,—
Oh my wrung heart, be thou content,
And feed upon his pain.

Go thou and watch her lightest sigh,—
Thine own it will not be;
And bask beneath her sunny eye,—
It will not turn on thee.

Far better hadst thou proved;

The poem begins with the speaker giving permission for her listener, a man she was in a relationship with, to go with another woman. She tells him he is more than welcome to gaze at her and smell her perfume. The speaker has no desire to reconcile with the man. This is all due to his choice to end the relationship. While the speaker was deeply hurt by this choice she now feels avenged. The woman he has chosen should not be trusted. The speaker knows the woman will soon leave him, causing him the same distress he caused her. When this happens her heart will finally be at peace."
468,"The apparition of these faces in the crowd:

And the faces of those who have come to say goodbye to them. It's been a long day for me.","In a Station of the Metro – The Poem The apparition of these faces in the crowd; Petals on a wet, black bough. Verbless Poetry As previously mentioned, one of the most striking elements of In the Station of a Metro is that it is written entirely without verbs. The poem is instead formed by combining two sentence fragments, each with a subject, but without an action, for that subject to perform. Needless to say, it can be very difficult to write without using action words, but this style does achieve one thing especially well: it captures a moment in time. In a sentence without action, nothing happens — in imagist poetry especially, this is a strength. In the case of this poem, it reads as an observation, as though the author has taken two photographs and paired them side by side."
469,"The room was suddenly rich and the great bay-window was
Spawning snow and pink roses against it

A tangerine and spit the pips and feel

I peel and portion a tangerine and spit the pips and feel the drunkenness of things being various.,"'Snow' is about the complexity of the world around us and how it is full of beauty and danger, often at the same time. 'Snow' is about several different experiences that occur at the same time. The speaker watches snow fall outside, admires some roses, eats a tangerine, and is warmed by a fire. It's also about the nature of experience itself, and how difficult it is to convey honestly when there is no one way to see or feel all the sensory impressions the world has to offer. As MacNeice puts it, everything insists on being “various,” making it hard to pin down."
470,"Morning
And Island man wakes up
To the sound of blue surf
In his head

To surge of wheels
To dull North Circular roar

His crumpled pillow waves

The poem begins with the speaker to give a stream of consciousness depiction of an island and what it is like to wake up there. Everything is calm, the birds and waves are the only sounds one can hear. There are men pushing out their boats to fish, and the sun is defiant in its entry into the sky. In the third stanza, there is a transition, the man is forced to return to London and the grey world of the “North Circular” road. The cars fly past him, as does time. He has to drag himself from one day to the next, there is nothing defiant about this kind of life."
471,"Forty-two years ago (to me if to no one else
The number is of some interest) it was a brilliant starry night
And the westward train was empty and had no corridors
So darting from side to side I could catch the unwonted sight
Of those almost intolerably bright
Holes, punched in the sky, which excited me partly because
Of their Latin names and partly because I had read in the textbooks
How very far off they were, it seemed their light
Had left them (some at least) long years before I was.

Light was leaving some of them at least then,
Forty-two years ago, will never arrive

It does get here may find that there is not

In the first stanza of 'Star-Gazer', the speaker begins by recalling a time forty-two years ago when he was running from one side of a train car to another in order to see the light of the stars. He emphasizes their beauty, the power of their light, and the pleasure he takes from knowing anything about them. He goes on to describe their lifespans and allude to his own. The speaker knows that the light from some of the stars won't reach earth until after everyone has died."
472,"In the long, sleepless watches of the night,
A gentle face — the face of one long dead —
Looks at me from the wall, where round its head
The night-lamp casts a halo of pale light.
Here in this room she died; and soul more white
Never through martyrdom of fire was led
To its repose; nor can in books be read
The legend of a life more benedight.
There is a mountain in the distant West
That, sun-defying, in its deep ravines
Displays a cross of snow upon its side.
Such is the cross I wear upon my breast
These eighteen years, through all the changing scenes
And seasons, changeless since the day she died.","In the long, sleepless watches of the night, a gentle face — the face of one long dead — looks at me from the wall, where round its head the night-lamp casts a halo of pale light.Here in this room she died; and soul more white was never through martyrdom of fire was led.","The Cross of Snow is a very powerful piece in large part because of its honest and straightforward language. Many poets will approach a theme such as immense grief or suffering with an abstract approach, one that captures the emotion by indirectly pointing out how difficult it is to properly express. In this poem, Longfellow speaks plainly about the death of a woman and uses his own feelings to propel the meaning of the poem, using only sparing metaphors to express them."
473,"Come live with me and be my love,
And we will all the pleasures prove,
That Valleys, groves, hills, and fields,
Woods, or steepy mountain yields.

Seeing the Shepherds feed their flocks,
By shallow Rivers to whose falls
Melodious birds sing Madrigals.

And I will make thee beds of Roses
And a thousand fragrant posies,
A cap of flowers, and a kirtle
Embroidered all with leaves of Myrtle;

A gown made of the finest wool
Which from our pretty Lambs we pull;
Fair lined slippers for the cold,
With buckles of the purest gold;

A belt of straw and Ivy buds,
With Coral clasps and Amber studs:
And if these pleasures may thee move,
Come live with me, and be my love.

For thy delight each May-morning:
If these delights thy mind may move,
Then live with me, and be my love.","Come live with me and be my love, and we will all the pleasures prove, says the poet.

The poem begins with the speaker asking his lover to come and be with him forever. If she does this simple thing, they will be able to experience all the joy that the world has to offer. They will have all the best in life. He continues on to state that not only will they be happy in their love, but that he will create for her the most lovely of items. He will use the flowers in their new abode to craft pieces of clothing like hats and petticoats. The shepherd will also use the wool from their lambs to make her dresses. He clearly believes that these items of clothing will be enough, along with his love, to entice her to live with him. By the end of the piece, it is not clear whether or not she accepts his offer, but he seems to understand that it is up to her. He has done his best, and is awaiting her answer."

In changing this to the phonetically similar 'Juan's', Bogan is mocking the supposed drama of love, downplaying its importance by highlighting the more ridiculous parts. She argues that deep down everyone knows when love isn't working, things not feeling quite right. If this is true, how do people get so shocked and heartbroken at the end of love – she asks the question 'Who is it, then, that love deceives?'."
475,"Where the remote Bermudas ride
In th’ ocean’s bosom unespy’d,
From a small boat, that row’d along,

That led us through the wat’ry maze
Unto an isle so long unknown,
And yet far kinder than our own?
Where he the huge sea-monsters wracks,
That lift the deep upon their backs,
He lands us on a grassy stage,
Safe from the storm’s and prelates’ rage.
He gave us this eternal spring
Which here enamels everything,
And sends the fowls to us in care,
On daily visits through the air.
He hangs in shades the orange bright,
Like golden lamps in a green night;
And does in the pomegranates close
Jewels more rich than Ormus shows.
He makes the figs our mouths to meet
And throws the melons at our feet,
But apples plants of such a price,
No tree could ever bear them twice.
With cedars, chosen by his hand,
From Lebanon, he stores the land,
And makes the hollow seas that roar
Proclaim the ambergris on shore.
He cast (of which we rather boast)
The Gospel’s pearl upon our coast,
And in these rocks for us did frame
A temple, where to sound his name.
Oh let our voice his praise exalt,
Till it arrive at heaven’s vault;
Which thence (perhaps) rebounding, may
Echo beyond the Mexic Bay.

An holy and a cheerful note,
And all the way, to guide their chime,
With falling oars they kept the time.","Where the remote Bermudas ride                In th’ ocean’s bosom unespy’d,                From a small boat, that row’D along, the list’ning winds receiv’'d this song.                What should we do but sing his praise                Unto an isle so long unknown, yet far kinder than our own?","'Bermudas' by Andrew Marvell presents the scenic beauty of the Bermuda sea as well as the Bermuda islands.

While they were on the boat sailing on the Bermuda sea, they could see the beautiful island of Bermuda. The poetic persona who narrates the pleasant aspects of the island, says that the island is “far kinder than our own?” It is to them a safe anode far from the religious harangue of their country. It lits their souls and provides them with a new hope. They can practice their religious rites and stay as they wish. There is no one to tell them what they should do or preach. It is a blissful place to start a new journey as they started long ago in their homeland."

Specifically, the negatives of “life” are discussed as the forefront thoughts of the poem in striking juxtaposition to the “good” elements of “life” that are offered afterward for a strong contrast. Although there is far more negative said about “life” than positive, the poem still leaves the reader with the notion that while catching the “good” elements might be difficult since they are so rare in comparison to the “poor” details of “life,” embracing them can lead to a “life” where experience and possibility are enough to make “life” a “good” thing."

There is nothing in this landscape for one to marvel at or question the nature of. The speaker continues to speak of how the birds do not cast shadows as they fly through the city, the sun is unable to reach them through the thick layer of clouds, smog, and smoke that fills the air. It is like a huge canvas sheet has been placed over the top of the city keeping it in darkness. The poem concludes by relating the quick pace of those walking on the streets to the speed of the cars, carriages, and coaches passing. All appear identical and pause for nothing as they hurry along. The poem concludes by alluding to the state of the city, the lack of warmth and sun, being a punishment placed on the residents."

The poem’s main speaker—who seems to be addressing a crowd or audience of some sort—imitates the gung-ho, unflinching patriotism that was popular in the United States during and after World War I, but this speech is filled with shallow, rambling clichés and empty platitudes. As a result, the poem becomes a parody of patriotism itself, framing certain forms of national pride as misguided and thoughtless. More specifically, the poem suggests that mindless patriotism often leads to violence, since it can fuel enthusiasm for war."

This simple building and business represent something larger in the poem—a freedom and escape from the bustling modern world of endless commerce and industrial advancement. As the poem progresses Pound's speaker asks for other things, many of which would obviously be contained within his shop. In conclusion, the speaker who has begun to sound more and more like Pound himself, asks that the gods do something, anything, to remove him from his “damn'd profession of writing”."

At this time, the poem compares the interaction between the sun and Earth to the aftermath of dispassionate sex between a couple. It goes on to describe the harshness of the sun as dawn gives way to noon. Here, Love Cycle relates the earth's endurance of the sun's scorching rays to the forbearance of a woman dissatisfied by her partner. Towards the end, however, it speculates why she (Earth) remains in a relationship with him (the sun), and therefore why this natural phenomenon reoccurs. Love Cycle concludes by implicitly mentioning moonlight, a gentle reflection of the sun's rays. The subdued nature of the sun at night gives Earth free reign over her partner. Love Cycle points to this moment as the reason she stays."

We may but pass as the world goes by
And take from a look of eyes into eyes,

The woman he envisions is kind, loving, and graceful. He utilizes nature imagery to create an almost nymph-like image in the mind of the reader. He imagines that this woman will enter his life and bring him nothing but joy and happiness. However, in the last stanza, the narrator admits that he knows it is possible that he will never meet this woman. He is also aware that it is possible they will cross paths but not end up together. While he dreams of one day finding his dream woman, he knows it is very possible that it will not happen."

The poem is quite short, at only four lines, but in these four lines, the speaker describes an “auk” who he says forgot how to fly when it learned to walk. This, he sees, is comparable to what's happening to humanity. He cautions everyone reading the poem, and everyone else in the world, that if humankind forgets the basics of human life, then we too may become extinct."

Into the silent noise his hangnail made,
Into the air outside the window, into ever.

Scuttling in, I forgot all about you.
Run along or you’ll be late.

So she slotted him back into schooltime,

In the first lines of this poem, the speaker, a child, describes how a child did “something very wrong.” Their teacher told them this was the case and that they had to stay after school till “half-past two.” But, it is soon revealed that the teacher had never taught the child time and therefore he had no concept of it. All he knew were phrases like “Gettinguptime” and “timeyouwereofftime.” The clock meant nothing to him. So he waited, outside of time, and unbothered. Finally, after forgetting about him, the teacher finds him again and sends him home. "
484,"I found a dimpled spider, fat and white,
On a white heal-all, holding up a moth
Like a white piece of rigid satin cloth--
Assorted characters of death and blight
Mixed ready to begin the morning right,
Like the ingredients of a witches' broth--
A snow-drop spider, a flower like a froth,
And dead wings carried like a paper kite.

What had that flower to do with being white,
The wayside blue and innocent heal-all?

Then steered the white moth thither in the night?
What but design of darkness to appall?--

The poem begins with the speaker discussing a spider and moth he found on the top of a flower. They came together there, as if kindred spirits, in order for the spider to eat the moth. He wonders over this convergence and equates it to a witch's brew. There are a few light-hearted lines in which the speaker plays with potion-related imagery. He then transitions in the sestet to discuss design, creation, more broadly, God."

I can't believe I've survived.","Still here by Langston Hughes is a poem that is grounded in varying grammar concepts to indicate weariness through struggle and clarity after the struggle concludes. The confusion of the struggle is presented in a juxtaposed format, coming just before the certain finale of victory, and the overall idea is that staying strong through the problems is worth that concluding victory and empowerment."
486,"STILL let my tyrants know, I am not doom'd to wear
Year after year in gloom and desolate despair;
A messenger of Hope comes every night to me,
And offers for short life, eternal liberty.

He comes with Western winds, with evening's wandering airs,
With that clear dusk of heaven that brings the thickest stars:
Winds take a pensive tone, and stars a tender fire,
And visions rise, and change, that kill me with desire.

Desire for nothing known in my maturer years,
When Joy grew mad with awe, at counting future tears:
When, if my spirit's sky was full of flashes warm,
I knew not whence they came, from sun or thunder-storm.

But first, a hush of peace—a soundless calm descends;
The struggle of distress and fierce impatience ends.
Mute music soothes my breast—unutter'd harmony
That I could never dream, till Earth was lost to me.

Then dawns the Invisible; the Unseen its truth reveals;
My outward sense is gone, my inward essence feels;
Its wings are almost free—its home, its harbour found,
Measuring the gulf, it stoops, and dares the final bound.

O dreadful is the check—intense the agony—
When the ear begins to hear, and the eye begins to see;
When the pulse begins to throb—the brain to think again—
The soul to feel the flesh, and the flesh to feel the chain.

Yet I would lose no sting, would wish no torture less;
The more that anguish racks, the earlier it will bless;
And robed in fires of hell, or bright with heavenly shine,
If it but herald Death, the vision is divine.","A messenger of Hope comes every night to me, and offers for short life, eternal liberty.

The poem begins with the speaker describing how he went down into the dungeons. He commanded the doors be opened and he looked in on the darkness. The speaker clearly has some authority here and maintains that as he addresses the warder. From this point on the majority of the narrative is focused around one “captive” held in the dungeon. This person is a young woman who appears pure, beautiful, and unconcerned by her situation. In warder is bothered by the woman's appearance. She is not as downtrodden as she should be. The woman speaks to the listener and the warder. She tells them that she is not unhappy, as she knows she won't be trapped in this place forever. Soon, she will be set free. When she is questioned about how this could be the case, she tells about her nightly visits. As she sleeps she is visited by Hope. It tells her that her short life will be rewarded in Heaven. This fact keeps her in good spirits. She does not see the point in crying or mourning as it will not save her or her imprisoned “kindred.” The following sections are used to describe the details of her dreams. They show her what her life will be like in heaven. There will be mute sounds that soothe her. All knowledge will be revealed and truths shown. The poem concludes with the speaker mourning the moments she returns to her waking life. They bring her a great deal of pain. The last lines show that the speaker has a new understanding of his captive. He has also seen that man's rule can be “overuled” by heaven. Explore more Emily Brontë poems."

Doller begins by focusing on a tree dying, the reason behind this astounding her. This then naturally follows on to the death of other things, like dogs. If dogs die in only a fraction of human life, are humans then the pets of trees, that live much longer than us? Many rhetorical questions are asked throughout the poem, Doller not sure where to point her curiosity. The poet then moves through the intricacy of language, finally settling on the realization that she has grown up."

Loose as the wind, as large as store.

To let me blood, and not restore

No flowers, no garlands gay? All blasted?

Thy rope of sands,

Good cable, to enforce and draw,
And be thy law,
While thou didst wink and wouldst not see.

To suit and serve his need
Deserves his load.""

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he will stand for his present life no longer. It is time for him to make a change and he intends to resurrect the parts of himself the lost in his youth. He will seek out real pleasures and no longer worry about what is right and wrong. As the poem continues, the extent of his confinement is revealed. He has crafted a prison for himself out of his own belief. The ropes will no longer keep him and he will utilize his fears to his own benefit. He will be a stronger man. The final lines bring the speaker back to his religious reality. The voice of God penetrates through his “rav[ing]” and calms his ardor. He will not do as he said he would; he has been taken back into the fold of the church."

That woman's days were spent In ignorant good-will,
Her nights in argument
Until her voice grew shrill.
What voice more sweet than hers When, young and beautiful, She rode to harriers?
This man had kept a school And rode our wingèd horse; This other his helper and friend Was coming into his force;
He might have won fame in the end, So sensitive his nature seemed, So daring and sweet his thought.
This other man I had dreamed
A drunken, vainglorious lout.
He had done most bitter wrong
To some who are near my heart, Yet I number him in the song;
He, too, has resigned his part
In the casual comedy;
He, too, has been changed in his turn, Transformed utterly:
A terrible beauty is born.
Hearts with one purpose alone Through summer and winter seem Enchanted to a stone
To trouble the living stream.
The horse that comes from the road, The rider, the birds that range From cloud to tumbling cloud, Minute by minute they change; A shadow of cloud on the stream Changes minute by minute; A horse-hoof slides on the brim, And a horse plashes within it; The long-legged moor-hens dive, And hens to moor-cocks call; Minute by minute they live: The stone's in the midst of all.
Too long a sacrifice
Can make a stone of the heart. O when may it suffice?
That is Heaven's part, our part To murmur name upon name, As a mother names her child When sleep at last has come On limbs that had run wild. What is it but nightfall?
No, no, not night but death; Was it needless death after all?

Before the Rising, they were just ordinary people who worked in shops and offices. He remembers his childhood friend Constance Markievicz, who is “that woman”; the Irish language teacher Padraic Pearse, who “kept a school” called St. Enda's; the poet Thomas MacDonagh “helper and friend” to Pearse; and even Yeats's own rival in love John MacBride, “a drunken, vainglorious lout.” After reflecting on the rebels' constancy of purpose, as if their hearts were “enchanted to a stone,” the poet wonders whether the rebellion was worth it. The poem ends on a note of ambivalence and futility, reflecting Yeats's own reluctance to engage in political debate. The poem is divided into four stanzas, symbolizing the month of April, the fourth month. It is known for its famous refrain, “All changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty is born.”"

Through her poetic skills, she is able to build up a new poetic vision. The poet was also influenced by Charles Olson's essay “Projective Verse,” published in 1950, in which the entire focus remains on “the possibilities of breath” and the kinetics of a poem. However, just as she mediates or translates her personal experience into words, it shows her great poetic skills. It is only by virtue of her poetry that readers are able to familiarize themselves with the poet's experience, and obtain a different level of understanding. In What Were They Like?, Levertov combines the intellectual with the emotional experience, the personal with the public, to come up with what she calls an “inscape.” Levertov, rather than shedding light over the battlefield of the Vietnam War, shifts the readers' attention to the daily life of the Vietnamese. The way she makes use of irony, it makes their lot seem even more disastrous. Remember, the poet produces irony without using a war-like terminology to address the victims, but she employs simple words like “buds,” “lanterns,” “laughter,” “ornament,” and “singing” so that the attention of the readers can be transferred to the everydayness of reality, and turned to the value of all simple things that people like to share in their lives."

The poem begins with the speaker describing blackness as being both a “commitment” and a “title.” It is what one is referred to as, but is also a promise one makes to “perceive” one's “Glory.” It is necessary for all black people to know their own greatness and worth. The speaker continues on to say that in white culture it is easy to say that it is a great thing to be white, so easy in fact that many black people would say the same. She looks down on this perception and knows that unless that individual belief is changed, nothing else will. She also describes the fact that “Blackness” is like a calling card. It is something that reaches across great distances and unifies all those who even have a drop of black blood. The poem comes to its conclusion with the speaker raising her voice and demanding that all those, no matter how much black blood they have, accept their own race and heritage."

Forgotten in a field of green;

They are made like mountains lifting, woven of forbidden music, and eternal in their pain. For hours I have never known.","'Hours' by Hazel Hall describes how hours are experienced like “cities,” “forbidden music” and in “mellow[er] tones” The poem begins with the speaker stating that she has lived through hours that have been “built like cities.” These periods of her life felt endless and mundane. They were as repetitive and unchanging as “grey house[s]” on grey houses. In amongst the city of hours, there were streets which trailed off into a “field of green.” There used to be a way out of the maze of buildings, but it has long since been forgotten. The second stanza describes another period experienced by the speaker. This is one of longing and eternal disappointment. She describes these times as the “white crests” of mountains peeking through the clouds. They are “forbidden” to her as they are completely out of her reach. In the final stanza Hall's speaker turns to address time as a whole. She sees it as being a “tapestry of hours.” All of one's positive and negative experiences, as well as those in the future and those which one will never see, are all blended together. There is no way to separate the good from the bad, it is all connected."

The poem begins with the birth of a “girlchild” who is immediately given all the toys she will need to learn how to be a good mother and wife. She has a “GE stove” and a baby doll, which requires diaper changes. The girl is immediately being trained in her future subservient role. She enters puberty, and the insults of other children start to wear away at her. They say that she has “a great big nose and fat legs.” These judgments stay with this young woman for the rest of her life. The speaker makes sure to emphasize all of the beautiful qualities this woman possesses, but neither she nor her peers are able to see and appreciate them. All they can see are her supposed “faults.” In the second half of Barbie Doll, worn down by the words of others, the woman cuts off her nose and legs as an offering to the world that has tormented her. She dies and is buried with a reconstructed face and “turn-up nose.” In death, the speaker ironically states, she has found the happy ending all women desire."

This leaf falls by itself and is not with other leaves. The image of a leaf falling also implies death. The life of the leaf is over for the season. The cold of the winter is soon to come and the chill of the fall has rendered the leaf lifeless. Thus, it falls to the ground by itself. This image is one of loneliness. The phrase existing inside of the word “loneliness” allows the reader to feel the emptiness mention here. The poem also functions visually.

You should have died at the apples’ dropping,
When the grasshopper comes to trouble,
And the wheat-fields are sodden stubble,
And all winds go sighing
For sweet things dying.","Why were you born when the snow was falling? You should have come to the cuckoo’s calling, says the poet. Why did you die when the lambs were cropping? The grasshopper comes to trouble, and the wheat-fields are sodden stubble.","'A Dirge' by Christina Rossetti is a thoughtful poem that takes the form of a dirge. It is addressed to someone who has passed away. In the first stanza of the poem, the speaker addresses a recently deceased person and asks them why they were born when they were born. They should've come into the world in the midst of life and warmth. Perhaps, in the middle of spring or summer when birds and plants were at their height. In the second stanza, they take a new approach to what they are saying and ask this person why they died when they did. They should've died in winter when the world was dark and gloomy. This would match up with the emotions that the speaker is experiencing."
497,"Most glorious Lord of life, that on this day,
Didst make thy triumph over death and sin:
And having harrow'd hell, didst bring away
Captivity thence captive, us to win:
This joyous day, dear Lord, with joy begin,
And grant that we for whom thou diddest die,
Being with thy dear blood clean wash'd from sin,
May live for ever in felicity.
And that thy love we weighing worthily,
May likewise love thee for the same again:
And for thy sake, that all like dear didst buy,
With love may one another entertain.
So let us love, dear love, like as we ought,
Love is the lesson which the Lord us taught.","Most glorious Lord of life, that on this day, that didst make thy triumph over death and sin:. Having harrow'd hell, didst bring away                Captivity thence captive, us to win:. This joyous day, dear Lord, with joy begin.","History of Petrarchan Sonnets The 13th century Italy is considered as the origin of sonnets and Dante, the father, dedicated the sonnets to his beloved Beatrice. But Petrarch evolved a new pattern of his own. He made the new sonnets the way to express human feelings. Both Dante and Petrarch idealized love but Petrarch to the earthly plane, vibrating the warm heartbeats of the lover. With the newly evolved Renaissance, the intense love for beauty, both celestial and earthly inculcated into men's minds. As Petrarch was influenced by Renaissance Humanism, his sonnets spoke about the glory of human love. The sonnets are composed of an octave followed by a sestet giving it a sort of revelation. It is like a returning wave."
498,"All things within this fading world hath end, Adversity doth still our joyes attend;
No ties so strong, no friends so dear and sweet, But with death’s parting blow is sure to meet. The sentence past is most irrevocable, A common thing, yet oh inevitable.
How soon, my Dear, death may my steps attend, How soon’t may be thy Lot to lose thy friend, We are both ignorant, yet love bids me These farewell lines to recommend to thee, That when that knot’s untied that made us one, I may seem thine, who in effect am none. And if I see not half my dayes that’s due,
What nature would, God grant to yours and you; The many faults that well you know I have Let be interr’d in my oblivious grave; If any worth or virtue were in me, Let that live freshly in thy memory And when thou feel’st no grief, as I no harms, Yet love thy dead, who long lay in thine arms.
And when thy loss shall be repaid with gains Look to my little babes, my dear remains. And if thou love thyself, or loved’st me,
These o protect from step Dames injury.
And if chance to thine eyes shall bring this verse,
With some sad sighs honour my absent Herse; And kiss this paper for thy loves dear sake,
Who with salt tears this last Farewel did take.","The poet wrote a farewell letter to his friend, who died in a car crash last year. He wrote: 'How soon, my Dear, death may my steps attend, How soon’t may be thy Lot to lose thy friend, We are both ignorant, yet love bids me These farewell lines'","'Before the Birth of One of Her Children' by Anne Bradstreet is a thoughtful piece about the inevitability of death. In the first lines of 'Before the Birth of One of Her Children,' the speaker begins by noting that everything in the world will eventually come to an end. This includes those she loves and the child she's carrying inside her. There is nothing strong enough to stand up against the specter of death. She notes the fact that her husband is probably going to die soon and how she doesn't know whether she's going to die in childbirth. It's a mystery whether she's going to make it through the pregnancy. She's writing this poem as a goodbye to her husband, who she may never get to properly say goodbye to. She hopes that she lives, but she wants him to know that even if she doesn't, she's still his. The speaker also wants her husband to know that she's fine with him remarrying but hopes he still takes care of her children if the new mother is cruel. Finally, she asks that her husband kiss this paper every once in a while to acknowledge the fact that she once loved him (if, of course, she does end up dying)."
499,"Twas eventide in June

In the first lines of this piece, the speaker sets the scene. It is June, and the reader is thrust into a still house in which there is a still room. All alone in the room is a canary trapped in a cage. As the sun sets it sings out to the last of the light and warmth. In contrast to the caged bid, there is a free bird on the lilac bush. It heard everything and after pausing, replies. There is some kind of correspondence between the two and the reader is left to wonder about their positions as “free” and “prisoner.”"
500,"The moon’s a peck of corn. It lies
Heaped up for me to eat.
I wish that I might climb the path
And taste that supper sweet.

And beat me till I’m sore.

For years and years and years.","The moon’s a peck of corn. It lies piled up for me to eat. Some day I’ll break the halter-rope, smash the stable-door,Run down the street and mount the hill just as the corn appears.","'The Old Horse in the City' by Vachel Lindsay looks into the mind of a horse longing for freedom from his cruel and negligent masters. Within the poem, the horse discusses the setting, the appearance of the moon, peace, and pain. The men beat the horse until he is “sore” and he determines that one day he's going to “break the halter-rope / And smash the stable-door” and escape. He will run free and see the moon, “a peck of corn” in his mind, and the rest of the world as he didn't before."

Specifically, his sternness is addressed through fitting examples, standard lowercase letters, and a lack of punctuation, but that is contrasted with the variation seen in the syllables of ‘From Not Him,’ as well as his limited “respect” and the “wiggl[ing of] his toes.” This contrast can be interpreted as a representation of people in general since often people are a blend of stern and flexible, and this simple tale told from the perspective of a child helps to solidify that concept.

502,"All Kings, and all their favourites,
All glory of honours, beauties, wits,
The sun itself, which makes times, as they pass,
Is elder by a year now than it was
When thou and I first one another saw:

Only our love hath no decay;
This no tomorrow hath, nor yesterday,
Running it never runs from us away,
But truly keeps his first, last, everlasting day.
Two graves must hide thine and my corse;
If one might, death were no divorce.
Alas, as well as other Princes, we
(Who Prince enough in one another be)
Must leave at last in death these eyes and ears,
Oft fed with true oaths, and with sweet salt tears;
But souls where nothing dwells but love
(All other thoughts being inmates) then shall prove
This, or a love increasèd there above,
When bodies to their graves, souls from their graves remove.
And then we shall be throughly blessed;
But we no more than all the rest.
Here upon earth we’re Kings, and none but we
Can be such Kings, nor of such subjects be;
Who is so safe as we? where none can do
Treason to us, except one of us two.

Let us love nobly, and live, and add again

There are no difficult allusions and references. He writes in a simple and direct manner. The lyric acquires force and energy, as the poet has succeeded in capturing the very rhythms and accents of spoken speech, as in the line, “When thou and I first one another saw” and the concluding lines of the poem."
503,"River, river, little river!

Bright you sparkle on your way;

O’er the yellow pebbles dancing,

Through the flowers and foliage glancing,

Like a child at play.

On you rush through rough and smooth;

Louder, faster, brawling, leaping.

Over rocks, by rose-banks, sweeping

Like impetuous youth.

 

River, river! Brimming river!

Broad and deep, and still as time;

Seeming still, yet still in motion,

Tending onward to the ocean,

Just like mortal prime.

Sea that line hath never sounded,

Sea that sail hath never rounded,

Like eternity.","River, river, little river! grotesquely bright you sparkle on your way, like a child at play, like impetuous youth. River, river! Brimming river! Broad and deep, and still as time, still like eternity, like eternity. Sea that line hath never sounded, the sea that sail hath never rounded.","'The River' by Caroline Anne Bowles is a simple poem in which the poet describes the changing size and metaphorical age of a river. In the first stanza of 'The River,' the poet describes the river as a child. As it grows in size, strength, and determination, it becomes a youth. Then, in the third stanza, it hits its prime where it is stretched to its will width and much calmer. This leads it into its final stage when it flows into the ocean and eternity. In this last stanza, the metaphorical life cycle of the river is completed and it ends up as a symbol for eternity, a religious allusion to God and Heaven."

The poem begins with the speaker telling the reader that grandmother and grandfather are going to dance. Halfe's care for her Cree heritage is seen through the caring and respectful tone of the text. She goes into detail about the atmosphere, mood and complex pieces of clothing the two dancing partners are going to wear. There are campfires burning, muskeg tea boiling, and a variety of references to other indigenous practices that help a reader imagine the scene fully and completely."
505,"We have memorized America,
how it was born and who we have been and where.
In ceremonies and silence we say the words,
telling the stories, singing the old songs.
We like the places they take us. Mostly we do.
The great and all the anonymous dead are there.
We know the sound of all the sounds we brought.
The rich taste of it is on our tongues.
But where are we going to be, and why, and who?
The disenfranchised dead want to know.
We mean to be the people we meant to be,
to keep on going where we meant to go.

But how do we fashion the future? Who can say how
except in the minds of those who will call it Now?
The children. The children. And how does our garden grow?
With waving hands—oh, rarely in a row—
and flowering faces. And brambles, that we can no longer allow.

Who were many people coming together
cannot become one people falling apart.
Who dreamed for every child an even chance
cannot let luck alone turn doorknobs or not.
Whose law was never so much of the hand as the head
cannot let chaos make its way to the heart.
Who have seen learning struggle from teacher to child
cannot let ignorance spread itself like rot.
We know what we have done and what we have said,
and how we have grown, degree by slow degree,
believing ourselves toward all we have tried to become—
just and compassionate, equal, able, and free.

All this in the hands of children, eyes already set
on a land we never can visit—it isn’t there yet—
but looking through their eyes, we can see
what our long gift to them may come to be.
If we can truly remember, they will not forget.","We have memorized America, how it was born and who we have been and where. The disenfranchised dead want to know.

One should not be unaware of their origin, meaning history. At the inauguration, Williams wanted to show the people of America how their history reflected the zeal for the betterment of the nation. The speaker of the poem, an old and wide voice portraying the poet, expresses their days are about to end. They have achieved what they meant to achieve. Now, the future of America lies in the hands of the children. How one brings up one's child leads to nation-building. Hence, the speaker advises everyone to invest in their budding generation to achieve optimum growth, both socially and economically."
506,"When midnight comes a host of dogs and men
Go out and track the badger to his den,
And put a sack within the hole, and lie
Till the old grunting badger passes by.
He comes an hears - they let the strongest loose.
The old fox gears the noise and drops the goose.
The poacher shoots and hurries from the cry,
And the old hare half wounded buzzes by.
They get a forked stick to bear him down
And clap the dogs and take him to the town,
And bait him all the day with many dogs,
And laugh and shout and fright the scampering hogs.
He runs along and bites at all he meets:
They shout and hollo down the noisy streets.

He turns about to face the loud uproar
And drives the rebels to their very door.
The frequent stone is hurled where'er they go;
When badgers fight, then everyone's a foe.
The dogs are clapped and urged to join the fray'
The badger turns and drives them all away.
Though scarcely half as big, demure and small,
He fights with dogs for hours and beats them all.
The heavy mastiff, savage in the fray,
Lies down and licks his feet and turns away.
The bulldog knows his match and waxes cold,
The badger grins and never leaves his hold.
He drives the crowd and follows at their heels
And bites them through—the drunkard swears and reels

The frighted women take the boys away,
The blackguard laughs and hurries on the fray.
He tries to reach the woods, and awkward race,
But sticks and cudgels quickly stop the chase.
He turns again and drives the noisy crowd
And beats the many dogs in noises loud.
He drives away and beats them every one,
And then they loose them all and set them on.
He falls as dead and kicked by boys and men,
Then starts and grins and drives the crowd again;
Till kicked and torn and beaten out he lies
And leaves his hold and crackles, groans, and dies.","When midnight comes a host of dogs and men go out and track the badger to his den.

The poem is written in iambic pentameter with a consistent rhyming pattern, using couplets (AABBCC…) although rhyme in contemporary poetry is often used to denote humor or joy, it was more frequently used in classical poetry, even in more somber poetry as is the case with this poem. This is somewhat bleak and chronicles the story of animals being used in badger baiting. A cruel blood sport where a badger is pulled from its home and repeatedly attacked by large dogs is a practice that, whilst illegal, is still occasionally practiced today."
507,"How good to lie a little while
And look up through the tree!
The Sky is like a kind big smile
Bent sweetly over me.

The poem begins with the speaker describing how she finds joy and peace in equal measure out in nature. She likes to go and “lie a little while” underneath a specific tree. From her spot there she sees the sky above her, looking down and protecting her. She is also able to enjoy the feeling of the dappled sunlight on her skin and take in the lace-like patterns it produces. In the second half of the poem, she describes the way the “Wind” sneaks up on her and whispers “pretty things” in her ear. Everywhere around her there is a force of nature ready to comfort her if she needs it."
508,"I find no peace, and all my war is done.

The poet's misery of being in love clear in the contradictory images present. In this poem 'I Find no Peace,' the speaker expresses his misery of being in love through absolutely contradictory ideas. The title which is also the first line begins with his inability to rest despite having no war to fight. His conflicting emotions are present in the way he is optimistic and afraid, ablaze and frozen, soaring yet unable to take off, desires death yet demands strength. He says he has nothing, yet he holds the whole world. Further, he feels there are no locks strong enough to bind or imprison him, yet bound by love in an inescapable prison. Ultimately, he feels that he has no control over his life or death. Also, in love, he sees without his eyes and complains without a tongue. Towards the end of the poem, the speaker seems to be happy despite the paradoxical elements of love."

In this poem, Hass beautifully depicts an autumn afternoon by using precise images. This poem is not a personal recapitulation of a day. Rather, it is more about the colors of nature and how it displays the internal emotions of the speaker. He is seen cooking for his loved ones. In the first stanza, he describes the natural landscape. Then, the poet goes on to describe the surroundings and the room where the food is served."

In this poem, the poet starts to talk about his mother's sadness that he tries to understand. Somehow he cannot understand what pained his mother when she was alive. Later he tells readers that it was the thoughts of death or dying that made his mother sad. Thereafter, the poet contemplates what it feels like to be dead. Interestingly, it appears a “form of gratitude” to him. Lastly, the speaker of the poem wants to be a hummingbird. Besides, he wishes to imitate its “nectar-questing song” along with his mother in heaven."
511,"Among twenty snowy mountains, The only moving thing Was the eye of the blackbird. I was of three minds, Like a tree In which there are three blackbirds. The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds. It was a small part of the pantomime. A man and a woman Are one. A man and a woman and a blackbird Are one. I do not know which to prefer, The beauty of inflections Or the beauty of innuendoes, The blackbird whistling Or just after. Icicles filled the long window With barbaric glass. The shadow of the blackbird Crossed it, to and fro. The mood Traced in the shadow An indecipherable cause. O thin men of Haddam, Why do you imagine golden birds? Do you not see how the blackbird Walks around the feet Of the women about you? I know noble accents And lucid, inescapable rhythms; But I know, too, That the blackbird is involved In what I know. When the blackbird flew out of sight, It marked the edge Of one of many circles. At the sight of blackbirds Flying in a green light, Even the bawds of euphony Would cry out sharply. He rode over Connecticut In a glass coach. Once, a fear pierced him, In that he mistook The shadow of his equipage For blackbirds. The river is moving. The blackbird must be flying.

The poem begins with a number of short stanzas, cantos, or sections which place the blackbird as an integral part of the world. It outlasts other creatures in the snow, stands in as a muse for the speaker, and appears in a number of different forms. The bird is made up of more than its simple physiology. It contains beauty, innuendos, and eccentricities which separate it from other creatures. 'Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird' concludes with the speaker returning to a snowy day in which he can look out at the landscape as see his muse and guardian, within a cedar tree, looking down over his home. The bird is a force on which he can depend. It will always be there, in one form or another, to watch over him."
512,"Stay, stay at home, my heart, and rest;
Home-keeping hearts are happiest,
For those that wander they know not where

And are baffled and beaten and blown about
By the winds of the wilderness of doubt;

To remain at home is best, says the author of the book, which is published by Oxford University Press.","'Song' by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow is made up of a speaker's plea that his “heart” remains indoors and not face the brutal real world which is full of trouble and wildness. 'Song' begins with the speaker asking his listener, who is either his own inner being, or a lover of one variety of another, to “stay at home.” This person seems frail to the speaker, as if she cannot live beyond the walls of a home. He asks that she not “wander” as some do, as it is an unhappy and unfulfilling life. He spends an amount of time describing just how unpleasant the lives of wanderers are and how they are never happy, always listless, and continually doubtful of their choices. This is not a life he wants for either himself or his lover. In the final lines, he repeats his previous sentiments and compares his “heart” to that of a bird who might be preyed on by a hawk."
513,"The just man followed then his angel guide
Where he strode on the black highway, hulking and bright;
But a wild grief in his wife’s bosom cried,
Look back. it is not too late for a last sight

Of the red towers of your native Sodom, the square
Where once you sang, the gardens you shall mourn,
And the tall house with empty windows where
You loved your husband and your babes were born.

She turned, and looking on the bitter view
Her eyes were welded shut by mortal pain;
Into transparent salt her body grew.
And her quick feet were rooted in the plain.

The least of our losses, this unhappy wife?
Yet in my heart she will not be forgot
Who, for a single glance, gave up her life.","The just man followed then his angel guide. He strode on the black highway, hulking and bright. But a wild grief in his wife’s bosom cried,                Look back. it is not too late for a last sight of Sodom.","'Lot's Wife' by Anna Akhmatova is a retelling of the biblical story about Lot's wife. 'Lot's Wife' by Anna Akhmatova presents the sad story of Lot's wife in an innovative manner. It seems the poet is actually sensitive about the story in which the poor wife of Lot turned into a statue of salt. Her lonely statue still stands on the “black mountain”. Men trailed by, overlooking it. But the poetic persona can hear the voices from the past. Someone is telling the lady to “look back”. The native people of “Sodom” blessed the marriage of Lot and the lady. However, fate was not in her favor. Her happy moments of married life turned into a lifelong burden of suffering. Inside the statue, the voice seems to be trapped. The poet can hear it. She says, “Yet in my heart I never will deny her,/ who suffered because she chose to turn.” The last line does not sound like regret. It celebrates the feminine perseverance in her heart."
514,"Now like the Lady of Shalott,
I dwell within an empty room,
And through the day and through the night
I sit before an ancient loom.
And like the Lady of Shalott
I look into a mirror wide,
Where shadows come, and shadows go,
And ply my shuttle as they glide.
Not as she wove the yellow wool,
Ulysses’ wife, Penelope;
By day a queen among her maids,
But in the night a woman, she,
Who, creeping from her lonely couch,
Unraveled all the slender woof;
Or, with a torch, she climbed the towers,
To fire the fagots on the roof!
But weaving with a steady hand
The shadows, whether false or true,
I put aside a doubt which asks
‘Among these phantoms what are you?’
For not with altar, tomb, or urn,
Or long-haired Greek with hollow shield,
Or dark-prowed ship with banks of oars,
Or banquet in the tented field;
Or Norman knight in armor clad,
Waiting a foe where four roads meet;
Or hawk and hound in bosky dell,
Where dame and page in secret greet;
Or rose and lily, bud and flower,
My web is broidered. Nothing bright
Is woven here: the shadows grow
Still darker in the mirror’s light!
And as my web grows darker too,
Accursed seems this empty room;
For still I must forever weave
These phantoms by this ancient loom.","Like the Lady of Shalott, I dwell within an empty room,                And through the day and through the night                I sit before an ancient loom.                I look into a mirror wide, where shadows come, and shadows go.                And ply my shuttle as they glide.                Not as she wove the yellow wool,                Ulysses’ wife, Penelope.                By day a queen among her maids,                But in the night a woman.","'Before the Mirror' by Elizabeth Drew Barstow Stoddard describes the life of a woman trapped within her home and the shadows of the world outside. The speaker begins this piece by describing the room in which she is trapped and her curse, like the Lady of Shalott, to sit before a loom and weave only the shadows she sees in her mirror. As the poem continues it becomes clear that the speaker deeply resents knowing what the world can be, and being unable to see it. She wants at least to be able to weave something of interest, or have some control over the life, like Penelope, but that is not to be. She is, or seems to be, eternally trapped within this room with her “web” darkening, and her mirror of shadows."
515,"Pale gold of the walls, gold
of the centers of daisies, yellow roses
pressing from a clear bowl. All day
we lay on the bed, my hand
stroking the deep
gold of your thighs and your back.
We slept and woke
entering the golden room together,
lay down in it breathing 
quickly, then
slowly again,
caressing and dozing, your hand sleepily
touching my hair now.

We made in those days
tiny identical rooms inside our bodies
which the men who uncover our graves 
will find in a thousand years,
shining and whole.","Pale gold of the walls, goldishlyof the centers of daisies, yellow rosespressing from a clear bowl.

We made in those days tiny identical rooms inside our bodies, which the men who uncover our graves will find in a thousand years.","In 'Gold,' Donald Hall describes the old memories stored inside the mind's attic that the speaker revisits often. In this poem, Hall's speaker begins with reference to a number of “golden” things such as the pale gold walls, centers of daisies, and yellow roses. These are meant to symbolize the precious memories the speaker wove with his beloved. Then, he talks about affectionate gestures like “caressing and dozing” to show how they made love. Hall refers to a “golden room” as a metaphor for their love. The room of his glorious past would remain intact even after their death. In the end, the poet says that they left similar golden rooms or remnants within one another. The yellowish aura of the rooms is so bright and wholesome that it would never dim."
516,"Beat! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow!
Through the windows—through doors—burst like a ruthless force,
Into the solemn church, and scatter the congregation,
Into the school where the scholar is studying,
Leave not the bridegroom quiet—no happiness must he have now with his bride,
Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering his grain,
So fierce you whirr and pound you drums—so shrill you bugles blow.

Beat! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow!
Over the traffic of cities—over the rumble of wheels in the streets;
Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses? no sleepers must sleep in those beds,
No bargainers’ bargains by day—no brokers or speculators—would they continue?
Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing?
Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge?
Then rattle quicker, heavier drums—you bugles wilder blow.

Beat! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow!
Make no parley—stop for no expostulation,
Mind not the timid—mind not the weeper or prayer,
Mind not the old man beseeching the young man,
Let not the child’s voice be heard, nor the mother’s entreaties,
Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the hearses,
So strong you thump O terrible drums—so loud you bugles blow.","Beat! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow!                Through the windows—through doors—burst like a ruthless force,                Into the solemn church, and scatter the congregation.                Leave not the bridegroom quiet—no happiness must he have now with his bride,                Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering his grain.","Written after the first battle of the Civil War, “Beat! Beat! Drums!” presents war as something all-consuming and disruptive to practically every aspect of daily life. The speaker tells the drums of a military band to sound the alarm of war in a way that will make it impossible to ignore. In doing so, the speaker frames the Civil War—and, in turn, war in general—as a “ruthless force” capable of stopping the country in its tracks. War, the poem implies, affects everything."
517,"Thank Heaven! the crisis,
The danger, is past,
And the lingering illness
Is over at last—
And the fever called ""Living""
Is conquered at last.

Sadly, I know
I am shorn of my strength,
And no muscle I move
As I lie at full length—
But no matter!—I feel
I am better at length.

And I rest so composedly,
Now, in my bed,
That any beholder
Might fancy me dead—
Might start at beholding me,
Thinking me dead.

The moaning and groaning,
The sighing and sobbing,
Are quieted now,
With that horrible throbbing
At heart:—ah, that horrible,
Horrible throbbing!

The sickness—the nausea—
The pitiless pain—
Have ceased, with the fever
That maddened my brain—
With the fever called ""Living""
That burned in my brain.

And oh! of all tortures
That torture the worst
Has abated—the terrible
Torture of thirst
For the naphthaline river
Of Passion accurst:—
I have drank of a water
That quenches all thirst:—

Of a water that flows,
With a lullaby sound,
From a spring but a very few
Feet under ground—
From a cavern not very far
Down under ground.

And ah! let it never
Be foolishly said
That my room it is gloomy
And narrow my bed;
For man never slept
In a different bed—
And, to sleep, you must slumber
In just such a bed.

My tantalized spirit
Here blandly reposes,
Forgetting, or never
Regretting, its roses—
Its old agitations
Of myrtles and roses:

For now, while so quietly
Lying, it fancies
A holier odor
About it, of pansies—
A rosemary odor,
Commingled with pansies—
With rue and the beautiful
Puritan pansies.

And so it lies happily,
Bathing in many
A dream of the truth
And the beauty of Annie—
Drowned in a bath
Of the tresses of Annie.

She tenderly kissed me,
She fondly caressed,
And then I fell gently
To sleep on her breast—
Deeply to sleep
From the heaven of her breast.

When the light was extinguished,
She covered me warm,
And she prayed to the angels
To keep me from harm—
To the queen of the angels
To shield me from harm.

And I lie so composedly,
Now, in my bed,
(Knowing her love)
That you fancy me dead—
And I rest so contentedly,
Now in my bed
(With her love at my breast).
That you fancy me dead—
That you shudder to look at me,
Thinking me dead:—

But my heart it is brighter
Than all of the many
Stars in the sky,
For it sparkles with Annie—
It glows with the light
Of the love of my Annie—
With the thought of the light
Of the eyes of my Annie.","Thank Heaven! the crisis, the danger, is past, the lingering illness is over, the fever called ""Living"" is conquered at last. The moaning and groaning, the sighing and sobbing, are quieted now, with that horrible throbbing at heart:—ah, that horrible,Horrible throbbing!","'For Annie' by Edgar Allan Poe describes the role of “Annie” or Nancy Heywood in the poet's life when he was struggling with the fever called “Living”. This long poem written in the praise of “Annie” presents how the poet felt before his recovery from his mental agony. It was a phase when the poet was like a living dead. If one looked at him they might think him to be a dead person. But when that lady came into his life, he started to recover gradually. For her selfless love and care, he has recovered from that mental ailment. For this reason, Poe expresses his gratitude to his friend, “Annie” to be with him when he needed her the most."
518,"“There are times when the mind
knows no wholeness. It sees the moon broken
in the branches, the finch’s shadow
as something terribly severed, black blood.
As if touch were annihilation.
As when a woman waits in her small room;
her lover enters,
raises his soft hand to her face … They lie down on the clean bed,
lie down on sweetness of pine,
feather pillows, polished wood;
but as he touches her
she pictures the shadow of a woman
burned into a wall, the others
who wandered in stunned silence
through the streets, their flesh
turned to rags in their hands.
She thinks of the woman’s arms
outstretched though they held nothing,
though there was nothing to hold onto up ahead … She gets up from the bed.
It is dark now,
the man’s throat
caged in shadows of branches as he sleeps.
Distance is the soul of the beautiful,
she had read, and she imagines an unknown planet
revolving in deep space, blue waves
in tender exile from the land.
Remorseless. Without witness.
If she could go there
she would possess nothing.
How beautiful the eart
might seem again from that distance.
How possible love.”","“There are times when the mind                knows no wholeness.

This poem begins with a description of a night sky. The brokenness of the images as well as the shadowy scene makes the speaker thoughtful. She opens the gate of her heart and finds herself with her lover. He touches her with his soft, warm hands. But, she can feel nothing except a solitary feeling. She introspects on death and the real value of life. Finally, she gets an answer from a text she read a while ago. It is about separating oneself from the mundane to dissolve into the infinite beauty of the world."
519,"Under a wall of bronze,
Where beeches dip and trail
Their branches in the water;
With red-tipped head and wings—
A beaked ship under sail—
There glides a single swan.

Under the autumn trees
He goes. The branches quiver,
Dance in the wraith-like water,
Which ripples beneath the sedge
With the slackening furrow that glides
In his wake when he is gone:
The beeches bow dark heads.

Into the windless dusk,
Where in mist great towers stand
Guarding a lonely strand,
That is bodiless and dim,
He speeds with easy stride;
And I would go beside,
Till the low brown hills divide
At last, for me and him.","Under a wall of bronze, where beeches dip and trail in the water, glides a single swan. With red-tipped head and wings, he is like a beaked ship under sail. He speeds with easy stride; and I would go beside, until the low brown hills divide for me and him.","'The Swan' by John Gould Fletcher describes the movements of a swan within a body of water and a desire to escape the realities of life. In the first section of the poem, the speaker begins by describing a creature, the swan, which is only named in the sixth line of the poem. The swan is living amongst a “bronze,” autumn landscape that contains numerous beech trees dipping their branches into a body of water. The swan is described as having a red-tipped head and wings and being able to glide through the water like a sailing ship. It is creating “furrows” in the water as it moves, impacting all the surrounding life. In the final stanzas, the speaker states that the swan is headed off into the distance where there are a number of “great towers,” presumably a city. The speaker admits that if he could he would join the bird in its journey and relish the pleasure of watching the hills in the distance make way for them."
520,"Two universes mosey down the street
Connected by love and a leash and nothing else.
Mostly I look at lamplight through the leaves
While he mooches along with tail up and snout down,
Getting a secret knowledge through the nose
Almost entirely hidden from my sight.
We stand while he's enraptured by a bush
Till I can't stand our standing any more
And haul him off; for our relationship
Is patience balancing to this side tug
And that side drag; a pair of symbionts
Contented not to think each other's thoughts.

What else we have in common's what he taught,
Our interest in shit. We know its every state
From steaming fresh through stink to nature's way
Of sluicing it downstreet dissolved in rain
Or drying it to dust that blows away.
We move along the street inspecting shit.

His sense of it is keener far than mine,
And only when he finds the place precise
He signifies by sniffing urgently
And circles thrice about, and squats, and shits,
Whereon we both with dignity walk home
And just to show who's master I write the poem.","Two universes mosey down the street.Connected by love and a leash and nothing else.Mostly I look at lamplight through the leaves.While he mooches along with tail up and snout down,Getting a secret knowledge through the nose.Almost entirely hidden from my sight.","'Walking the Dog' by Howard Nemerov contains a description of the poet walking his dog and the commonalities they share. The poem starts with the speaker talking about how he and his dog inhabit separate universes. The only thing they can communicate through is love. The dog sees and smells things his owner never will. As the poem progresses, Nemerov uses an amusing image of the two as poop connoisseurs, having seen every type of animal droppings in existence as they walk and sniff their way through the streets. The poem ends with the speaker announcing that he wrote this poem after returning home to prove he's in charge."
521,"I’ve stayed in the front yard all my life.
I want a peek at the back
Where it’s rough and untended and hungry weed grows. A girl gets sick of a rose.
I want to go in the back yard now And maybe down the alley,
To where the charity children play. I want a good time today.
They do some wonderful things.
They have some wonderful fun.
My mother sneers, but I say it’s fine
How they don’t have to go in at quarter to nine. My mother, she tells me that Johnnie Mae Will grow up to be a bad woman.
That George’ll be taken to Jail soon or late
(On account of last winter he sold our back gate).
But I say it’s fine. Honest, I do.
And I’d like to be a bad woman, too,
And wear the brave stockings of night-black lace And strut down the streets with paint on my face.","I’ve stayed in the front yard all my life.

The young speaker begins by comparing her front yard to the life she's living and her backyard and the adjoining alley to the kind of life she wants to experience. She's jealous of the freedom the charity children have. It's something she'd like for herself, even if it does come with implications of future crimes and bad behavior. Her mother doesn't approve of these kids, but that doesn't deter the speaker from dreaming about a life as a “bad woman.”"
522,"Why should I blame her that she filled my days
With misery, or that she would of late
Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,
Or hurled the little streets upon the great,
Had they but courage equal to desire?
What could have made her peaceful with a mind
That nobleness made simple as a fire,
With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind
That is not natural in an age like this,
Being high and solitary and most stern?
Why, what could she have done, being what she is?
Was there another Troy for her to burn?","Why should I blame her that she filled my days with misery, or that she would of late have taught to ignorant men most violent ways, he asks. What could have made her peaceful with a mind that nobleness made simple as a fire, he wonders. Was there another Troy for her to burn?","The poem opens on a sad note that Maud Gonne rejected the poet’s love proposal and filled him with misery but then takes a turn to question her revolutionary and violent methods which she preached to the people of Ireland to free their country from British subjugation. The title of the poem, ‘No Second Troy,’ reminds the readers of the “Helen Of Troy” which was destroyed and burnt down at the end of a ten-year war. It points to the contrast between the Homeric times when there was the beautiful city of Troy and the times of “an age like this” when there is no second Troy to be destroyed and burnt down."

The poem takes the reader through a series of violent images that depict an abusive relationship between a male/female newlywed couple. Although the narrative is not clearly defined, there are certain poignant moments that inform the reader of the dynamic between the two. The woman does what she can to control her husband's anger. She tries to make herself as perfect as possible or face the “werewolf” that she married."

525,"I know a funny little man,
As quiet as a mouse,
Who does the mischief that is done
In everybody’s house!

And yet we all agree

By Mr. Nobody.

And scatters pins afar;
That squeaking door will always squeak,

And all the carpets soil.

It describes the various mischievous acts of Mr. Nobody. In the first stanza of this poem, the speaker notes that there is a “funny little man” who is as quiet as a mouse who lives within every home. It is this Mr. Nobody who is responsible for broken plates, leaving doors open, putting damp wood on the fire, bringing mud into the house, misplacing the morning paper, and leaving the blinds open. These simple mistakes, acts of mischief, and messes are all everyday occurrences that are sources of trouble for children. The poem takes a clever approach to the idea of a child shifting the blame for breaking a plate over to “Mr. Nobody.”"
526,"He turned to me with his kind, sleepy gaze
And fresh face slowly brightening to the grin
That sets my memory back to summer days,
With twenty runs to make, and last man in.
He told me he’d been having a bloody time
In trenches, crouching for the crumps to burst,
While squeaking rats scampered across the slime
And the grey palsied weather did its worst.

But as he stamped and shivered in the rain,
My stale philosophies had served him well;
Dreaming about his girl had sent his brain
Blanker than ever—she’d no place in Hell....

Wondering ‘why he always talked such tripe’.","‘Good God!’ he laughed, and slowly filled his pipe, ‘why he always talked such tripe’ ‘I’ve been having a bloody time in the trenches, crouching for the crumps to burst, squeaking rats scampered across the slime’","Written in the first person, there is clearly a close relationship between the two men in 'A Subaltern.' In the first stanza, the subaltern confides in the speaker about the “bloody time” he is having in the war. The speaker observes him almost lovingly, detailing his beauty which appears in sharp contrast to the undeniable horror and bleakness around them. In the second stanza, the moment of genuine connection shared by the two men is broken by the speaker's “stale philosophies” and the subaltern dismisses his words and feelings as “tripe.”"
527,"How rich, O Lord! how fresh thy visits are!
'Twas but just now my bleak leaves hopeless hung
Sullied with dust and mud;
Each snarling blast shot through me, and did share
Their youth, and beauty, cold showers nipt, and wrung
Their spiciness and blood;
But since thou didst in one sweet glance survey
Their sad decays, I flourish, and once more
Breath all perfumes, and spice;
I smell a dew like myrrh, and all the day
Wear in my bosom a full sun; such store
Hath one beam from thy eyes.
But, ah, my God! what fruit hast thou of this?
What one poor leaf did ever I yet fall
To wait upon thy wreath?
Thus thou all day a thankless weed dost dress,
And when th'hast done, a stench or fog is all
The odor I bequeath.","How rich, O Lord! how fresh thy visits are! How rich, how fresh they are. How rich they are!

The poem begins with the speaker praising God and his ability to improve the speaker's own state of being. It is clear from the start of 'Unprofitableness' that the narrator has a very low opinion of himself. Even by the end of the poem, when God's light has made him infinitely better, he still isn't good enough to bequeath one leaf or flower to a wreath in heaven."
528,"Are you content, you pretty three-years’ wife?
Are you content and satisfied to live
On what your loving husband loves to give,
And give to him your life?

Are you content with work, — to toil alone,
To clean things dirty and to soil things clean;
To be a kitchen-maid, be called a queen, —
Queen of a cook-stove throne?

Are you content to reign in that small space --
A wooden palace and a yard-fenced land --
With other queens abundant on each hand,
Each fastened in her place?

Are you content to rear your children so?
Untaught yourself, untrained, perplexed, distressed,
Are you so sure your way is always best?
That you can always know?

Have you forgotten how you used to long
In days of ardent girlhood, to be great,
To help the groaning world, to serve the state,
To be so wise — so strong?

And are you quite convinced this is the way,
The only way a woman’s duty lies --
Knowing all women so have shut their eyes?
Seeing the world to-day?

Having no dream of life in fuller store?
Of growing to be more than that you are?
Doing the things you know do better far,
Yet doing others - more?

Losing no love, but finding as you grew
That as you entered upon nobler life
You so became a richer, sweeter wife,
A wiser mother too?

What holds you? Ah, my dear, it is your throne,
Your paltry queenship in that narrow place,
Your antique labours, your restricted space,
Your working all alone!

Be not deceived! ‘Tis not your wifely bond
That holds you, nor the mother’s royal power,
But selfish, slavish service hour by hour --
A life with no beyond!","Are you content with work, — to toil alone, to clean things dirty and to soil things clean? Are you so sure your way is always best? That you can always know? Have you forgotten how you used to long, to be great, to help the groaning world, to serve the state?","Each stanza, aside from the last, of this poem, begins with a question. The speaker is hoping, through her incessant questioning and probing, to reveal to the “young wife” that her life is not exactly what it seems. She is not the “queen” of a kingdom like she is treated. She is only in charge of a confining house and a stove. The speaker continues to ask the woman if she did not have a better life in mind for herself when she was younger. One in which she could do something meaningful. She also states that until she has become a fuller person, the young wife will not be able to raise her children to the best of her abilities. To the Young Wife concludes by stating that setting out from home to better oneself does not result in a loss of love but the improvement of oneself as a person. This pursuit of passion will allow the young wife to be a better wife and mother. The last lines make clear that it is not her vows which hold her in the home but the unending service she provides to the home. She is able to set herself free."
529,"Like as a huntsman after weary chase,
Seeing the game from him escap'd away,
Sits down to rest him in some shady place,
With panting hounds beguiled of their prey:
So after long pursuit and vain assay,
When I all weary had the chase forsook,
The gentle deer return'd the self-same way,
Thinking to quench her thirst at the next brook.
There she beholding me with milder look,
Sought not to fly, but fearless still did bide:

And with her own goodwill her firmly tied.

So goodly won, with her own will beguil'd.","Like as a huntsman after weary chase, seeing the game from him escap'd away, he sits down to rest him in some shady place.

The poem explores themes of desire, perseverance, and the surprising nature of love. The huntsman, exhausted from his fruitless chase, finds respite in a shady spot, accompanied by his panting hounds, who have been deprived of their prey. Similarly, the speaker of the poem has engaged in a long and futile pursuit of his beloved, only to abandon it in weariness. However, just as the deer that was being pursued by the huntsman unexpectedly returns to the same location, the speaker’s love interest comes back to him, seemingly with the intention of quenching her thirst at a nearby brook. The deer, upon seeing the speaker, does not attempt to flee but rather remains fearless and steadfast in his presence. The speaker then approaches the deer, who is trembling but does not resist, and he firmly binds her at her own consent. The speaker finds it strange and remarkable to witness a wild animal willingly and beautifully won over."
530,"Nuns fret not at their convent’s narrow room;
And hermits are contented with their cells;
And students with their pensive citadels;
Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom,
Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom,
High as the highest Peak of Furness-fells,
Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells:
In truth the prison, into which we doom
Ourselves, no prison is: and hence for me,
In sundry moods, ’twas pastime to be bound
Within the Sonnet’s scanty plot of ground;
Pleased if some Souls (for such there needs must be)
Who have felt the weight of too much liberty,
Should find brief solace there, as I have found.","Nuns fret not at their convent’s narrow room;And hermits are contented with their cells;And students with their pensive citadels.Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom,Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom,High as the highest Peak of Furness-fells,Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells.","'Nuns Fret Not at Their Convent's Narrow Room' by William Wordsworth is about the happiness and peace people find in different ways of life. The first part of the poem lists out a few different people, from a nun to hermit and student. Each lives in a different place and experiences different confides. This life, even if it seems confining to someone else, isn't. It's not really a prison, the poet says. The poem concludes with the poet discussing his own “prison,” the sonnet form. It's something that he finds peace in and he takes pleasure from the fact that a few others may as well."
531,"She dwelt among the untrodden ways
Beside the springs of Dove,
A Maid whom there were none to praise
And very few to love:

A violet by a mossy stone
Half hidden from the eye!
—Fair as a star, when only one
Is shining in the sky.

She lived unknown, and few could know
When Lucy ceased to be;
But she is in her grave, and, oh,
The difference to me!","She was a Maid whom there were none to praise and very few to love. She lived unknown, and few could know when Lucy ceased to be. But she is in her grave, and, oh, what a difference she has made to me! She is fair as a star, when only one is shining in the sky.","In this poem, Wordsworth examines an idealized and unrequited love for Lucy, a girl who has died young.The poem examines loneliness and loss, but also unrecognized beauty and dignity. She Dwelt among the Untrodden Ways has three quatrains with simple language (mainly words of one syllable), and it has an ABAB rhyme scheme. Furthermore, Wordsworth’s poem can be read as an elegiac poem, with graceful descriptions and a mourning tone. Thus, She Dwelt among the Untrodden Ways’s main theme is death, a death that is described and grieved for throughout the entire poem."
532,"I feel the spring far off, far off,
The faint, far scent of bud and leaf—
Oh, how can spring take heart to come
To a world in grief,
Deep grief?
The sun turns north, the days grow long,
Later the evening star grows bright—
How can the daylight linger on
For men to fight,
Still fight?
The grass is waking in the ground,
Soon it will rise and blow in waves—
How can it have the heart to sway
Over the graves,
New graves?
Under the boughs where lovers walked
The apple-blooms will shed their breath—
But what of all the lovers now
Parted by Death,
Grey Death?","I feel the spring far off, far off off, off off in the distance. The faint, far scent of bud and leaf. Oh, how can spring take heart to come to a world in grief,                Deep grief? The sun turns north, the days grow long, the evening star grows bright.","This piece is a series of questions asked by a narrator who is confused about how spring can continue to come, the sun can continue to shine, and plants bloom under the shadow of war. The poem begins with the speaker's sensing of spring far off in the distance, but coming all the same. She asks how “Spring can take heart to come / To a world in grief.” She repeats this pattern in the rest of the stanzas questioning how daylight can persist while men “Still fight,” how grass can grow and wind can blow over “New graves,” and lastly, how apple-blooms can bud where lovers, now parted by death, once walked. In totality, this piece is meant to show that while war is powerful and it seems like it should stop the whole world in its tracks, it cannot. Fighting, and the problems of humans, cannot stop the seasons from changing, grass from growing, or trees from flowering."
533,"He drowsed and was aware of silence heaped
Round him, unshaken as the steadfast walls;
Aqueous like floating rays of amber light, 
Soaring and quivering in the wings of sleep.
Silence and safety; and his mortal shore
Lipped by the inward, moonless waves of death.
 
Someone was holding water to his mouth.
He swallowed, unresisting; moaned and dropped
Through crimson gloom to darkness; and forgot
The opiate throb and ache that was his wound.
Water—calm, sliding green above the weir;
Water—a sky-lit alley for his boat, 
Bird-voiced, and bordered with reflected flowers
And shaken hues of summer: drifting down, 
He dipped contented oars, and sighed, and slept.
 
Night, with a gust of wind, was in the ward,
Blowing the curtain to a gummering curve.
Night. He was blind; he could not see the stars
Glinting among the wraiths of wandering cloud;
Queer blots of colour, purple, scarlet, green,
Flickered and faded in his drowning eyes.
 
Rain—he could hear it rustling through the dark;
Fragrance and passionless music woven as one;
Warm rain on drooping roses; pattering showers
That soak the woods; not the harsh rain that sweeps
Behind the thunder, but a trickling peace, 
Gently and slowly washing life away.

He stirred, shifting his body; then the pain
Leaped like a prowling beast, and gripped and tore
His groping dreams with grinding claws and fangs.
But someone was beside him; soon he lay
Shuddering because that evil thing had passed.
And death, who'd stepped toward him, paused and stared. 
 
Light many lamps and gather round his bed.
Lend him your eyes, warm blood, and will to live.
Speak to him; rouse him; you may save him yet.
He's young; he hated war; how should he die
When cruel old campaigners win safe through?
 
But death replied: “I choose him.” So he went,
And there was silence in the summer night;
Silence and safety; and the veils of sleep.
Then, far away, the thudding of the guns.","He drowsed and was aware of silence heaped round him, unshaken as the steadfast walls. He swallowed, unresisting; moaned and dropped through crimson gloom to darkness; and forgot the opiate throb and ache that was his wound. He could hear it rustling through the dark;Fragrance and passionless music woven as one; Warm rain on drooping roses.","'The Death Bed' by Siegfried Sassoon tells of the suffering and eventual peaceful death of a soldier mortally wounded in World War I. The poem begins with the speaker describing the terrible condition a young soldier is in. The only moments he gets any relief from the pain are those induced by opiates. When asleep, he can drift through his mind on a river. It is a peaceful symbol for death and the afterlife that the young man seems to welcome. As the poem progresses the contrast between his sleeping and waking worlds is further emphasized. When he moves, he is in incredible agony as if a beast jumped on his body and was trying to tear him apart. Eventually, death comes to his side, and decides it is time for him to go. From there, the two depart, and silence falls again over the hospital ward. The last line reminds the reader that the war rages on right outside the hospital. You read the full poem here."
534,"O silent wood, I enter thee
With a heart so full of misery
For all the voices from the trees
And the ferns that cling about my knees.

In thy darkest shadow let me sit
When the grey owls about thee flit;
There will I ask of thee a boon,
That I may not faint or die or swoon.

Gazing through the gloom like one
Whose life and hopes are also done,
Frozen like a thing of stone
I sit in thy shadow – but not alone.

Can God bring back the day when we two stood
Beneath the clinging trees in that dark wood?","O silent wood, I enter thee with a heart so full of misery. I ask of thee a boon, that I may not faint or die or swoon. I sit in thy shadow – but not alone. Can God bring back the day when we two stood?","Siddal begins 'A Silent Wood' by addressing the woods in which she is contemplating entering. It is clear from the beginning that this speaker is deep within a depressive state, she speaks clearly on the misery that is within her heart and the fact that it is only intensified by the woods themselves. The plants and creatures she will encounter there do nothing to soothe her, but instead, bring back powerful memories of her experiences in the past. The second stanza elaborates on these emotions and the speaker asks of the wood that she is allowed to sit within its darkest corner. Not only does she wish to inflict further emotional distress on herself by entering the woods, but she also wants to find the darkest part. In addition to this request, she asks that she can find the strength to not “swoon” when she is there. The third stanza is made up of the speaker's description of how she will act when she is there. She will be as a stone, cold and unmoving, but she will not be alone. The final two lines of the piece are a question asked by the speaker, hoping that God can somehow bring back the time in which she and her lover walked in the wood together. This is the first time in which the poem the source of her depression is made clear."
535,"She came every morning to draw water
Like an old bat staggering up the field:
The pump’s whooping cough, the bucket’s clatter
And slow diminuendo as it filled,
Announced her. I recall
Her grey apron, the pocked white enamel
Of the brimming bucket, and the treble
Creak of her voice like the pump’s handle.
Nights when a full moon lifted past her gable
It fell back through her window and would lie
Into the water set out on the table.
Where I have dipped to drink again, to be
Faithful to the admonishment on her cup,
Remember the Giver fading off the lip.","She came every morning to draw water like an old bat staggering up the field. I recall her grey apron, the pocked white enamelOf the brimming bucket, and the trebleCreak of her voice like the pump’s handle. Nights when a full moon lifted past her gable it fell back through her window and would lie on the table.","“A Drink of Water,” the speaker reveals the character of an old woman, who used to fetch water from his well. The poem starts with the usual description of the usual coming of the woman to the well. The poet's use of the verb “came” suggests that the poet was already there to observe it. This old woman's presence gave the poet joy and happiness, as he used to watch her every time. However, in the sestet, the poet moves inside the house, and also from day to night. This shows that Heaney is so familiar with the old woman that he knew all about her. The final line of the poem suggests that the old woman to be his “muse” meaning she gave him the “inspiration”. He “drinks the water as if receiving inspiration” to express his memories and life experiences as a young boy living on a farm in Ireland."
536,"At dawn the ridge emerges massed and dun 
In the wild purple of the glow'ring sun, 
Smouldering through spouts of drifting smoke that shroud 
The menacing scarred slope; and, one by one, 
Tanks creep and topple forward to the wire. 
The barrage roars and lifts. Then, clumsily bowed 
With bombs and guns and shovels and battle-gear, 
Men jostle and climb to, meet the bristling fire. 
Lines of grey, muttering faces, masked with fear, 
They leave their trenches, going over the top, 
While time ticks blank and busy on their wrists, 
And hope, with furtive eyes and grappling fists, 
Flounders in mud. O Jesus, make it stop!","At dawn the ridge emerges massed and dun. Smouldering through spouts of drifting smoke that shroud the menacing scarred slope. One by one, Tanks creep and topple forward to the wire. The barrage roars and lifts. Then, clumsily bowed, men jostle and climb to meet the bristling fire.","'Attack' by Siegfried Sassoon depicts the preparation of a military attack and the struggle of the soldiers in a filthy ambiance. 'Attack' by Siegfried Sassoon is a haunting poem that discusses the reality of war and what happens when a soldier is out on the battlefield. Sassoon transitions between describing the battlefield physically, to describing the soldiers physically and eventually conclude with the feelings of the soldiers. Sassoon builds suspense with every line and uses imagery, personification, and enjambment to capture the reader's attention and as accurately as possible describe the true horrors of being a soldier at war."
537,"Pity me not because the light of day
At close of day no longer walks the sky;
Pity me not for beauties passed away
From field and thicket as the year goes by;
Pity me not the waning of the moon,
Nor that the ebbing tide goes out to sea,
Nor that a man’s desire is hushed so soon,
And you no longer look with love on me.
This have I known always: Love is no more
Than the wide blossom which the wind assails,
Than the great tide that treads the shifting shore,
Strewing fresh wreckage gathered in the gales:
Pity me that the heart is slow to learn
What the swift mind beholds at every turn.","Pity me not because the light of day no longer walks the sky. Pity me that the heart is slow to learn what the swift mind beholds. Love is no more than the wide blossom which the wind assails, than the great tide that treads the shifting shore, than fresh wreckage gathered in the gales.","The speaker of 'Sonnet 29' is asking the person with whom she is in love to stop pitying her. While the tone throughout the poem is quite melancholy, the speaker also seems to be realistic when it comes to love, comparing the cycles in nature to the cycle of romance. The speaker recognizes and accepts that her lover no longer loves her, and she says that she has always known that this is the way of love. It is fleeting and fickle."
538,"Hot-eyed Mafia Queen!
At the trim garden’s edge
She sways towards August.
A Bumble Bee
Clambers into her drunken, fractured goblet –
Up the royal carpet of down-hung,
Shrivel-edged, unhinged petal, her first-about-to-fall.
He’s in there as she sways. He utters thin
Sizzling bleats of difficult enjoyment.
Her carnival paper skirts, luminous near-orange,
Embrace him helplessly.
Already her dark pod is cooking its drug.
Every breath imperils her. Her crucible
Is falling apart with its own fierceness.
A fly, cool, rests on the flame-fringe.
Soon she’ll throw off her skirts
Withering into vestal afterlife,
Bleeding inwardly
Her maternal nectars into her own
Coffin – (cradle of her offspring).
Then we shall say:
She wore herself in her hair, in her day,
And we could see nothing but her huge flop of petal,
Her big, lewd, bold eye, in its sooty lashes,
And that stripped, athletic leg, hairy
In a fling of abandon – ‘","Hot-eyed Mafia Queen!                At the trim garden’s edge                She sways towards August.                Already her dark pod is cooking its drug.                Every breath imperils her.                Soon she’ll throw off her skirts and die.                Then we shall say: ‘She wore herself in her hair, in her day’","In 'Big Poppy' Ted Hughes deals with momentary attraction and pleasure that leads the poppy to its impending doom. Using a simple image from nature, he projects the gender differences and the momentariness of emotions that exist in the human world. The 'Big Poppy' on the outset is a simple poem about the poppy flower and the bumble bee's attraction towards the sexuality emanating from the poppy flower. The personified Poppy flower and the Bumblebee demonstrate the sexual attraction between them. The exchange between the flower and the Bee deals with the temporariness of the relationship. The poet's choice of words and tone clarifies that there is no tender love present. However, in the end, the flower's extravagance becomes a villain bringing it to its doom."
539,"SWEET, thou hast trod on a heart.
Pass! there’s a world full of men;
And women as fair as thou art
Must do such things now and then.
Thou only hast stepped unaware,—
Malice, not one can impute;
And why should a heart have been there
In the way of a fair woman’s foot?
It was not a stone that could trip,
Nor was it a thorn that could rend:
Put up thy proud underlip!
’Twas merely the heart of a friend.
And yet peradventure one day
Thou, sitting alone at the glass,
Remarking the bloom gone away,
Where the smile in its dimplement was,
And seeking around thee in vain
From hundreds who flattered before,
Such a word as,—“Oh, not in the main
Do I hold thee less precious,—but more!”
Thou’lt sigh, very like, on thy part:—
“Of all I have known or can know,
I wish I had only that Heart
I trod upon, ages ago!”","SWEET, thou hast trod on a heart. There’s a world full of men; and women as fair as thou art must do such things now and then. It was not a stone that could trip, nor a thorn that could rend.’Twas merely the heart of a friend.","'A False Step' by Elizabeth Barrett Browning is about a woman who disregarded the genuine feelings of a person. The poem begins with a direct address to a “Sweet” lady who had admirable qualities during her youth. She was so blind due to her beauty that she could not understand the feelings of a genuine lover. She hurt her and metaphorically trod upon his “heart.” The poet says it was rather the person's fault who came in her way. At the end, when her physical beauty fades away, she is going to regret her decision. Then she would realize the importance of true love that is not time's fool, a fleeting feeling."
540,"There sat down, once, a thing on Henry's heart
só heavy, if he had a hundred years
& more, & weeping, sleepless, in all them time
Henry could not make good.
Starts again always in Henry's ears
the little cough somewhere, an odour, a chime.
And there is another thing he has in mind
like a grave Sienese face a thousand years
would fail to blur the still profiled reproach of. Ghastly,
with open eyes, he attends, blind.
All the bells say: too late. This is not for tears;
thinking.
But never did Henry, as he thought he did,
end anyone and hacks her body up
and hide the pieces, where they may be found.
He knows: he went over everyone, & nobody's missing.

He knows: he went over everyone, & nobody's missing.","Dream Song 29' by John Berryman is a reality-bending exploration into the mind of “Henry” a terribly sad and troubled man. Throughout this short poem, Berryman's speaker describes Henry's depression as a weight on his heart that he can't get rid of. Even when it fades for a moment, it always comes back when Henry hears, sees, or smells something triggering. The speaker adds another layer to Henry's confusion as he describes the man's perception of himself as a killer. Although he's wrong, Henry continually has to check to make sure that he hasn't killed anyone and chopped up their body. "
541,"Sir, no man's enemy, forgiving all
But will his negative inversion, be prodigal:
Send to us power and light, a sovereign touch
Curing the intolerable neural itch,
The exhaustion of weaning, the liar's quinsy,
And the distortions of ingrown virginity.
Prohibit sharply the rehearsed response
And gradually correct the coward's stance;
Cover in time with beams those in retreat
That, spotted, they turn though the reverse were great;
Publish each healer that in city lives
Or country houses at the end of drives;
Harrow the house of the dead; look shining at
New styles of architecture, a change of heart.","Sir, no man's enemy, forgiving all men, but will his negative inversion, be prodigal.Send to us power and light, a sovereign touch.Curing the intolerable neural itch,                The exhaustion of weaning, the liar's quinsy,                And the distortions of ingrown virginity.                New styles of architecture, a change of heart.","The poem, 'Petition,' was composed by Auden in October, 1929. Its earlier title was 'Sir, No Man's Enemy'. It was published in the poetic volume, Poems (1930. It was the last poem in the volume. At the time of its composition, Auden was a psychologist poet. Under the influence of Sigmund Freud, George Groddeck, Homer Lane, John Layard, and D.H. Lawrence, he believed that man's 'psychological ills' were 'greater' than this 'political' ones. His belief can be stated as follows: Sexual love is the main urge in man. It draws man and woman together. If it is allowed a free play, it bursts forth as the Life-force, called Id in man. But there is another force too in man. It is the death instinct, which reflects itself as the fear of death. It lies vested in the faculty of mind and is called the Super-ego. So the belief under which the present poem was composed can be summed up as follows: Modern human culture and civilization have systematically repressed sexual love in man and in society for ages and ages. The result is that society is ruled by morals and laws of the Super-ego which is the Death-force to sexual love. In effect, society is ruled by Death-force, and man and society are 'sick', or rather, inhibited by death-wish. Let me tell you here that society and individuals are sick because men and their culture have repressed vital human forces (in themselves). The Super-ego has nearly defeated the 'id' (i.e. Life-force). Cure demands a change of heart, a change in the individuals. The power of the super-ego must be overthrown and the languishing 'id' released from its fetters.'"
542,"I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground.
So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:
Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned
With lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.
Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you.
Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.
A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,
A formula, a phrase remains,—but the best is lost.
The answers quick and keen, the honest look, the laughter, the love,—
They are gone. They are gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled
Is the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not approve.
More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.
Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave
Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;
Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.

The speaker emphasizes that she is not resigned to death even if she knows it will happen to everyone. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker begins by telling readers that she has not resigned herself to the fact that all people, thinkers, and lovers included, eventually end up in the darkness of the earth. All of these people go into the dark with only a little remaining to be remembered. The witty, the intelligent, kind, and all those who have ever done well on earth will end up in the dark, with their body, memories, and spirits, feeding the roses. The poet's speaker continues to resist this fact. She is “not resigned,” meaning she is not giving up when it comes to the idea of death."
543,"I do not love you as if you were salt-rose, or topaz,
or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off.
I love you as certain dark things are to be loved,
in secret, between the shadow and the soul.

I love you as the plant that never blooms
but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers;
thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance,
risen from the earth, lives darkly in my body.

I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where.
I love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride;
so I love you because I know no other way

than this: where I does not exist, nor you,
so close that your hand on my chest is my hand,
so close that your eyes close as I fall asleep.","I do not love you as if you were salt-rose, or topaz, or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off. I love you because I know no other way than this: where I does not exist, nor you, nor your hand on my chest.","Darkness in the Poem One of the most important images in 'I do not love you' is darkness. It comes in a variety of forms, from “Shadow” in the fourth line, to “light…hidden” and “obscure things.” There are continual references to something dark or obscure. This changes the tone of the text, making it more mysterious and even dangerous. It is not clear why Neruda made this choice, but clearly, there is something about the situation that edges him towards the darker side of things. Another detail of note, Neruda uses the second person. He is directly speaking to one person. Considering the fact that the collection in which the poem as included, Love Sonnets, is dedicated to Neruda's wife. This should lead one to believe that Matilde Urrutia is the intended listener."
544,"The only relics left are those long
spangled seconds our school clock chipped out

Now I learn you died
serving among the natives of Garden City,
Kansas, part of a Peace Corps
before governments thought of it.

foreign chaff and have addresses like titles,

the old river. May they never

Stafford's descriptive language helps readers imagine a sweet love story between the speaker and Ruth in this poem. The use of words like “relics” and “monuments” makes the poem seem like a special tribute to the girl. In the first stanza, the speaker says that Ruth glanced back at him. It clearly shows that she also felt for the speaker. He also highlights the reason for their parting and wishes her to be safe in heaven. Overall, this poem reflects how the speaker misses her to this very day and wishes if he would have had spent some more “seconds” with her."
545,"Let it disturb no more at first

Than the hint of a pool predicted far in a forest,

Or a sea so far away that you have to open

Your window to hear it.

Necessity,

For lips to linger or eye to receive itself

Back in reflection, simply

As water the patient moon persuades and stirs.

And then step closer,

Imagine rivers you might indeed embark on,

Waterfalls where you could

Silence an afternoon by staring but never

See the same tumult twice.

The full piazza. Come where the noise compels.

Statues are bowing down to the breaking air.

Too wild for the lights which illuminate it to hold,

Even a moment, an ounce of water back;

Stare at such prodigality and consider

It is the elegance here, the taming,

The keeping of a thousand flowering sprays,

That builds this energy up but lets watchers

See in that stress an image of utter calm,

A stillness there. It is how we must have felt

Once at the edge of some perpetual stream,

Fearful of touching, bringing no thirst at all,

Panicked by no perception of ourselves

But drawing the water down to the deepest wonder.","Let it disturb no more at first at first than the hint of a pool predicted far in a forest, or a sea so far away that you have to open your window to hear it.

The poem begins with an instruction for the reader. Jennings urges the audience not to be taken away by the sound of a fountain. They should wait and let it be.

The third stanza is all about different aspects of a fountain that Jennings appreciates the most."

I wonder if you feel it.,"Twelve' by Lynn Melnick explores parental love, Melnick protecting her child from the world. Instead of having her child repeat the childhood that Melnick had, she tries to be a better parent. The poem has many delicate moments, Melnick displaying touching instances of parental love. Twelve starts by focusing on what the poet was doing when she 'was your age'. This then moves down to a comparison with the peaceful slumber of her daughter, protected from the world. Melnick moves through more examples, including being letting 'boys' 'claw her carcass' for a 'quarter'. The poet vows to give her daughter a better life, not wanting her to 'know what I know'."
547,"Minutes before the rain begins
I always waken, listening
to the world hold its breath,
as if a phone had rung once in a far
room or a door had creaked
in the darkness.

Perhaps the genes of some forebear
startle in me, some tribal warrior
keeping watch on a crag beside a loch,
miserable in the cold,

though I think it is a woman's waiting
I have come to know,
a Loyalist hiding in the woods,
muffling the coughing of her child
against her linen skirts, her dark head
bent over his, her fear spent
somewhere else in time,

leaving only this waiting,

and I hope she escaped
with her child, and I suppose she did.
If not, I wouldn't be lying here awake,
alive, listening for the rain to begin
so that she can run, the sound
of her footsteps lost, the sight
of them blotted away on the path.","Minutes before the rain begins, I always waken, listening to the world hold its breath. I think it is a woman's waiting for me, a Loyalist hiding in the woods. I hope she escaped with her child, and I suppose she did. If not, I wouldn't be lying here awake, listening for the rain to begin.","In 'Before the Rain', Lianne Spidel begins with the poet explaining how she always wakes up just before it begins to rain. She believes that in a past life she was once 'some tribal warrior' or 'a Loyalist hiding in the woods', hiding their child from sight. She imagines that the cover of rainfall would be the perfect weather to stop them from being heard as they ran away, with the footsteps becoming lost in the downpour. Spidel connects with this far away identity, seeing herself as a descendant of this historic woman. They both listen for the rain, still in the darkness while waiting for the first signs of its coming. As the rain arrives, Spidel can finally see how the woman escapes, a sense of joy flooding from present to past."
548,"Our sea is still mysterious as morning mist

its flapping arms stretched out for dry sand

its running heels sliding over pebbles

when the sun dives in at night

my love an ache, the early light

spreading the water

seven years seven years I repeat

over and over

I repeat my love an ache, the early light. Seven years seven years I repeat it over and over. Over and over, I repeat the words.",'In the Seventh Year' by Jackie Kay is a nature and emotion-focused poem that describes a relationship in its seventh year. The poem uses an extended metaphor to describe the ever-changing nature of the speaker's relationship. The relationship is described as turbulent in one moment and beautiful and calm in the next. It is something that brings the speaker a great deal of pain and joy. It is “timeless” and “changing.” This suggests the speaker believes that the relationship is going to continue to change in the future. This isn't something she's dreading but something that she has embraced. You can listen to the full poem here.

The poem takes the reader through simple details that depict the landscape of New York, the speaker's state of mind, and his surprise at learning that Lana has collapsed. He's with a companion of some sort, to whom this poem is addressed, but doesn't pay too much attention to this person. Instead, he's more interested in the weather, comparing New York to California, and the world of Lana Turner."
550,"Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art—
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
And watching, with eternal lids apart,
Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,
The moving waters at their priestlike task
Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,
Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors—
No—yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,
Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,
Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,
Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,
And so live ever—or else swoon to death.","Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art. Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night. And watching, with eternal lids apart, like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite. But gazing on the new soft-fallen mask of snow upon the mountains and the moors.","'Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art' by John Keats contains a speaker's desire to remain in the company of his lover forever. 'Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art' by John Keats begins with the speaker stating that he wants to be “stedfast” like a star. John Keats envies its sure and stable position from which it can see the earth in all its glory. From this description of the poem he moves then to the image of him, nestled in bed against the breast of his 'fair love'. The implication is clearly that he would like to preserve this moment forever, just as the star remains fixed in its eternal spot. Moreover, the poet immediately goes back on the first statement and gives the reader several reasons why he does not want this. The most important of these is that the stars are alone. They do not have anything to occupy their minds besides the troubles of humans down below nor do they have true companions. Hence they are alone and cold in the dark. As the poem continues, the speaker describes how he wants to take on a star's steadfast position so that he might stay with his lover. He is happiest with his head “Pillow'd” on her breast and intends to live there in his emotions for the rest of time."
551,"He loved her and she loved him.
His kisses sucked out her whole past and future or tried to
He had no other appetite
She bit him she gnawed him she sucked
She wanted him complete inside her
Safe and sure forever and ever
Their little cries fluttered into the curtains

Her eyes wanted nothing to get away
Her looks nailed down his hands his wrists his elbows
He gripped her hard so that life
Should not drag her from that moment
He wanted all future to cease
He wanted to topple with his arms round her
Off that moment's brink and into nothing
Or everlasting or whatever there was

Her embrace was an immense press
To print him into her bones
His smiles were the garrets of a fairy palace
Where the real world would never come
Her smiles were spider bites
So he would lie still till she felt hungry
His words were occupying armies
Her laughs were an assassin's attempts
His looks were bullets daggers of revenge
His glances were ghosts in the corner with horrible secrets
His whispers were whips and jackboots
Her kisses were lawyers steadily writing
His caresses were the last hooks of a castaway
Her love-tricks were the grinding of locks
And their deep cries crawled over the floors
Like an animal dragging a great trap
His promises were the surgeon's gag
Her promises took the top off his skull
She would get a brooch made of it
His vows pulled out all her sinews
He showed her how to make a love-knot
Her vows put his eyes in formalin
At the back of her secret drawer
Their screams stuck in the wall

Their heads fell apart into sleep like the two halves
Of a lopped melon, but love is hard to stop

In their entwined sleep they exchanged arms and legs
In their dreams their brains took each other hostage

In the morning they wore each other's face",He loved her and she loved him. His kisses sucked out her whole past and future or tried to. She bit him she gnawed him she sucked. She wanted him complete inside her. He gripped her hard so that life should not drag her from that moment's brink. He wanted all future to cease.,"Lovesong' by Ted Hughes describes a relationship that exists between an unnamed man and woman who are deep in the joys and pains of love. The poem begins with the speaker stating that the two are doing everything they can to “keep” one another past the natural ending of this moment and their greater love affair. They both know that the emotions they are experiencing are limited. At some point, the moment is going to end and they are going to have to go back to the real world. In the next section, the speaker describes the highs and lows of their “moment.” They feel an unlimited passion for one another. Sometimes though it is tinted by anger, false promises, and feelings of revenge. These equally passionate emotions define their relationship as much as the positive ones do. "

‘Warm Summer Sun’ by Mark Twain is a poem that expresses the process of aging and life, all the way to life’s final moments. The wording involved in this representation of life shows that the journey does come with hardships, but it is a beautiful concept. The quickness of the poem mimics, as well, the rapid speed that life can take, so underneath the wonder expressed regarding life, there is also the caution to hold to it fully since it can prove fleeting. From beginning to end, though, the beauty of life remains a grounding theme to this poem."

This poem revolves around the influence of the “-isms” on Coleman's mind. The speaker, who is the poet herself, expresses how concepts like racism, capitalism, and others influence her mind. The reflection of the ideas is everywhere. In the air, the people living around the speaker, music, supermarket aisles, television, streets, even in the flashing street lights, a person can find the reflection of those things. Thus, it influences the mind and shapes it according to the idea that is accepted by the majority."

The poem invokes the audience to notice eels that hide in low tide. They are described using three metaphors, namely “preliminary,” “pre-world creatures,” and “cousins of the moon.” Then the speaker goes on to talk about their looks and their shyness in human presence. While they make their way into their hiding, the observer could only hear muted “hissed interruptions” and the sound of the wind. When the wind cleared, they could find the creature again silently floating in the water. Once again, if one makes a slight movement, they dive back into their hiding."

The first line tells the reader that they're about to hear about a dream. In this dream, the speaker came upon someone's suicide note. This belonged to someone they cared deeply about. When they opened it, the bag caught fire, and the mice inside it ran out into the field. The bag burnt, and the letters disappeared along with it. As they burnt, the writer's voice was released into the air like a song, and the mice grew “wilder.”"
557,"I grieve and dare not show my discontent,

Follows me flying, flies when I pursue it,
Stands and lies by me, doth what I have done.

His too familiar care doth make me rue it, no means I find to rid him from my breast.","'On Monsieur's Departure' by Queen Elizabeth I describes the emotional tumult a speaker experiences after separating from the one she loves. The poem begins with the speaker describing how she is grieving but is unable to show it. She is restricted by her position, whether that be as Queen of England, as the poet was, or as a woman, from showing her true emotions. She is always two things at once: talkative and mute, cold and hot, in love and full of hate. The speaker has an inner self she is unable to acknowledge. In the second stanza she mourns the fact that even though this person is gone, she is unable to stop feeling for him. She can't get a hold of the cares in her life enough so that she may control them. They run from her, and continuously haunt her as she tries to find some peace. In the final stanza, she asks that she no longer be kept in this liminal place between love and hate. She wishes that her lover either scorn her, or act gentler towards her as her current state of being is untenable. By the end, she has come to the conclusion that there is no way her for to rid herself of her cares. They will stay with her until her death."

In this poem, Pope's speaker spends his time talking about her and praising her reason, wit, and beauty. Yet, she is just a friend and nothing more. The speaker seems smitten by the woman's neglect as he describes her as a beautiful (handsome), humble and sensible person. Everyone in the court can testify to her beauty and nature, yet she does not see it in herself as if she is blind to “Pride” and “Folly.” The tone of the poem is ironic and pointed as the speaker desperately wants her attention and for her to realize her worth."

And swing past the summer-house, buried in talk,
And cool the verandah that welcomes us in

The view from my bedroom of moss-dappled path,
As I struggle with double-end evening tie,

The pictures of Egypt are bright on the wall,

The couple have since fallen in love and are now engaged.,"'A Subaltern's Love Song' by John Betjeman is a humorous, upbeat poem that tells of the real-life love the poet had for Miss Joan Hunter Dunn. The poem begins with the speaker exclaiming over how much he cares for Dunn, and the joy he gets from playing tennis with her. She always wins, and while this sometimes makes him sad, it more than often makes him “glad.” She wins skillfully and “gaily.” After playing tennis on this particular day, the two go around the house and have drinks while watching the news. They are staying in a large house which is clearly owned by Dunn's family. After this, they get ready to go out. They're going to a dance at a Golf Club, and are getting into their best clothes. The speaker struggles with his tie, and then describes the surroundings of the house. There are a number of trophies in Dunn's room, and clothes on the floor. He ends up waiting for her at the bottom of the stairs and they drive together to the club. The speaker is very excited by the prospect of the evening, but even more so by the fact that he is with Dunn. Rather than go inside though, it appears that the two stay in the car talking. This leads to the last line, announcing that they got engaged."
560,"That time my grandmother dragged me
through the perfume aisles at Saks, she held me up
by my arm, hissing, “Stand up,”
through clenched teeth, her eyes
bright as a dog’s
cornered in the light.
She said it over and over,
as if she were Jesus,
and I were dead. She had been
solid as a tree,
a fur around her neck, a
light-skinned matron whose car was parked, who walked on swirling
marble and passed through
brass openings—in 1945.
There was not even a black
elevator operator at Saks.
The saleswoman had brought velvet
leggings to lace me in, and cooed,
as if in the service of all grandmothers.
My grandmother had smiled, but not
hungrily, not like my mother
who hated them, but wanted to please,
and they had smiled back, as if
they were wearing wooden collars.
When my legs gave out, my grandmother
dragged me up and held me like God
holds saints by the
roots of the hair. I begged her
to believe I couldn’t help it. Stumbling,
her face white
with sweat, she pushed me through the crowd, rushing
away from those eyes
that saw through
her clothes, under
her skin, all the way down
to the transparent
genes confessing.","That time my grandmother dragged me through the perfume aisles at Saks, she held me up, hissing, “Stand up,” through clenched teeth.

The speaker of this poem shares her childhood experience of going to the Saks departmental store. She hesitates to share the details except for her grandmother's reaction on that day. Her grandmother dragged her through the perfume aisles and repeatedly told her to get up in utter humiliation. The speaker could not disobey her order, yet she clung to her problems. Then, she was dressed into tight leggings and dragged away from the store. What her grandmother felt on that day is described in this poem."
561,"A voice said, Look me in the stars
And tell me truly, men of earth,
If all the soul-and-body scars
Were not too much to pay for birth.","A voice said, Look me in the stars. And tell me truly, men of earth,If all the soul-and-body scarsWere not too much to pay for birth. And I said, 'Yes, that's exactly what I'm going to do'","A Question Analysis A voice said, Look me in the stars And tell me truly, men of earth, If all the soul-and-body scars Were not too much to pay for birth. No need to do a verse-by-verse analysis of 'A Question' — this is the entire poem. And despite its small size, it says a lot. At its face value, the poem can be read and understood fairly easily. How might one weigh the tragedies of life against its potential and its opportunities? If the human soul originates in a place where there is no pain — God, Heaven, or whatever it is you believe in, if you do believe in those concepts — then how can the silence of nonexistence compare to the pains of life? It's a highly philosophical and very abstract question. Who the voice in the stars in is unidentified; were the “m” in “me” capitalized, we could safely assume the voice is God, but it seems likely this is intentionally kept ambiguous. Still, to assume it is God or a God-like figure would make sense as a concept, but the point of the poem is, as the title suggests, the question itself. Are all the soul-and-body scars too much to pay for the life that deals them? And, in a much darker image, what if the answer to the question is “no?” As a commentary on life, we can see the narrator wondering to themselves what it is they get from living that makes it worth the pain, and the fact that the poem ends there indicates what a difficult question it is to answer. The poem also suggests that this suffering is destiny — discussing pain as an “entry fee” for living suggests that no matter who you are or where you're born, it is likely that you will find yourself questioning whether living is quite worth the pain associated. On the other hand, this makes perfect sense as an analysis — everyone experiences pain at some point or the other. Personal loss, grief, tragedy; in a sense, these are destiny, and that seems to be what this poem is getting at. And in those moments of suffering, we have to be able to remember the best parts of our life and remember that there is light that makes our lives worth living, and that makes our suffering worth enduring."
562,"I love the silent hour of night,
For blissful dreams may then arise,
Revealing to my charmed sight
What may not bless my waking eyes.

And then a voice may meet my ear,
That death has silenced long ago;
And hope and rapture may appear
Instead of solitude and woe.

Cold in the grave for years has lain
The form it was my bliss to see;
And only dreams can bring again,
The darling of my heart to me.","I love the silent hour of night, for blissful dreams may then arise. The darling of my heart to me. The form it was my bliss to see; and only dreams can bring again, only dreams. I love the silence of the night, and the stillness of the day.","The course of Night follows the speaker contemplating the power of nighttime in contrast to the day. The narrator — presumably Anne Brontë herself — expresses a very specific emotion that the nighttime brings out. It is a strange combination of solitude, loneliness, and comfort, coupled with what appears to be heartsickness. It is a complicated poem, for all its simplicity, because of how intensely it examines the emotion."

They sowed their isn’ts and reaped their same sun moon stars rain.,"'anyone lived in a pretty how town' by E. E. Cummings is a complex poem that depicts the life and death of “anyone” and “noone”. In the first stanza of the poem, the speaker introduces a man named “anyone” who lived in an ordinary town filled with the chiming of bells. He moved through life honestly, always aware of everything he'd left undone, and happy to celebrate the things he had accomplished. Despite his seemingly good nature, noone in the two “both little and small” cared for “anyone” at all. They cared only for themselves and continued to plant and harvest in that way. The speaker goes on to introduce “noone” a woman who lived in the same area and loved anyone. The relationship was at first interesting for the children, but they soon forgot about it despite the growing love noone had for anyone. Noone was well aware of everything anyone was feeling. Anyone eventually died as did noone. The townspeople who'd been concerned with their own lives, took the time to bury them next to one another. The poem concludes with an emphasis on the cyclical nature of life and the birth of the next generation of townspeople."
564,"SERENE, I fold my hands and wait,
Nor care for wind, nor tide, nor sea;
I rave no more 'gainst time or fate,
For, lo! my own shall come to me.
 
I stay my haste, I make delays,
For what avails this eager pace?
I stand amid the eternal ways,
And what is mine shall know my face.
 
Asleep, awake, by night or day,
The friends I seek are seeking me;
No wind can drive my bark astray,
Nor change the tide of destiny.
 
What matter if I stand alone?
I wait with joy the coming years;
My heart shall reap where it hath sown,
And garner up its fruit of tears.
 
The waters know their own and draw
The brook that springs in yonder height;
So flows the good with equal law
Unto the soul of pure delight.
 
The stars come nightly to the sky;
The tidal wave unto the sea;
Nor time, nor space, nor deep, nor high,
Can keep my own away from me.","SERENE, I fold my hands and wait, nor care for wind, nor tide, nor sea;                I rave no more 'gainst time or fate,                For, lo! my own shall come to me.

The poem begins with the speaker declaring that he's no longer going to fight his fate. He's going to sit back and wait for it to come to him. He knows, as he repeats throughout the entire poem, that there is nothing he can do to change the future. He should just accept it and know that good things are coming. He's lived a good life, he implies, and will therefore be rewarded."
565,"Christopher Robin
Had wheezles
And sneezles,
They bundled him
Into
His bed.
They gave him what goes
With a cold in the nose,
And some more for a cold
In the head.
They wondered
If wheezles
Could turn
Into measles,
If sneezles
Would turn
Into mumps;
They examined his chest
For a rash,
And the rest
Of his body for swellings and lumps.
They sent for some doctors
In sneezles
And wheezles
To tell them what ought
To be done.
All sorts and conditions
Of famous physicians
Came hurrying round
At a run.
They all made a note
Of the state of his throat,
They asked if he suffered from thirst;
They asked if the sneezles
Came after the wheezles,
Or if the first sneezle
Came first.
They said, ""If you teazle
A sneezle
Or wheezle,
A measle
May easily grow.
But humour or pleazle
The wheezle
Or sneezle,
The measle
Will certainly go.""
They expounded the reazles
For sneezles
And wheezles,
The manner of measles
When new.
They said ""If he freezles
In draughts and in breezles,
Then PHTHEEZLES
May even ensue.""


Christopher Robin
Got up in the morning,
The sneezles had vanished away.
And the look in his eye
Seemed to say to the sky,
""Now, how to amuse them to-day?""","Christopher Robin had wheezles and sneezles. Doctors gave him what goes with a cold in the nose, and some more for a head cold. They also examined his chest for a rash, and the rest of his body for swellings and lumps. When he woke the next day, the sneezes had vanished.","'Sneezles' by A.A. Milne tells of the complicated, nonsense illness contracted by the famous character from children's literature, Christopher Robin. The poem begins with the speaker telling of Christopher's illness and how his parents put him to bed. He was suffering from what sounds like a cold but his parents get very upset, imagining that it was something worse. They consult with a number of doctors who make the situation out to be even more complicated and nonsensical than it already is. By the end of the poem, it is clear that Christopher is all better and is planning the next thing he's going to do to “amuse” his parents."

The poem begins with the speaker using the phrase “You cannot do this to them, these are my people”. It appears again at the end of the poem, bookmarking the verses. She tells the reader and her intended listener that what she is talking about is not “poetry” or “art”. It is not made entirely clear who she is speaking about, but it is likely the people who make art and poetry. She does not want her people mistreated. Their “horizons,” representing hope and the future, are not going to be hacked away on her watch. She plans to chronicle whatever happens to them, just as their graves will. In the last stanza, she tries to make sense of what, presumably writing and art are for “[her] people”. They are vices similar to the desire to win trophies and be around horses. They are related to food and music, as well as dancing and power. Her people are more like scientists than artists."
567,"I shoot the Hippopotamus
With bullets made of platinum,
Because if I use leaden ones
His hide is sure to flatten 'em.","I shoot the Hippopotamus with bullets made of platinum,Because if I use leaden ones, his hide is sure to flatten 'em. I shoot the hippopotamusWith bullets Made of Platinum, Because if I Use Leaden Ones, His hide will flatten'em.","'The Hippopotamus' by Hilaire Belloc is a short and humorous poem about shooting a hippopotamus with expensive bullets. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins by stating that there are times when they need to shoot a hippopotamus. This is a surprising line that is supposed to inspire the reader to continue through the next three lines to find out what situations the speaker finds themselves in. Rather than illuminating the kind of life they lead further, the speaker says that they have to use “platinum” bullets because “lead” ones are only going to flatten on the animal's hide. This is an example of a hyperbolic statement that's created in order to make the poem more humorous."
568,"If ever two were one, then surely we.
If ever man were loved by wife, then thee.
If ever wife was happy in a man,
Compare with me, ye women, if you can.
I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold,
Or all the riches that the East doth hold.
My love is such that rivers cannot quench,
Nor ought but love from thee give recompense.

'To My Dear and Loving Husband' by Anne Bradstreet is a love poem. It talks about the sweet relationship between the poet and her husband. Through this poem, the poet glorifies her loving husband. She feels like they are no different. They are one. There are no such materialistic things that can be compared with their feelings for one another. The poet has a thirst for the love of his husband and his heart has the thing the poet longs for. In fact, by writing this verse Anne Bradstreet wants to immortalize her love for her husband. As poetry is something that outlives men, their love will remain forever in these lines of the poem. 'One day I wrote her name upon the strand' by Edmund Spenser also says the same thing at its end."

Mother country get it right, an just for de record,Sum of me best friends are white.","No Problem' by Benjamin Zephaniah is a poem describing how the poet faced racial discrimination in his early life. 'No Problem' by Benjamin Zephaniah says that the poet is not a problem in a white-dominated society. It's their problem that they can't accept the poet as he is. His color isn't the actual problem, it's the mindset that sees the only color. That divides humans according to their speaking style, origin, and bodily characteristics. The poet goes beyond such discriminatory thoughts and welcomes an air of individual freedom in his poem. He proclaims himself as a “versatile” person who wanted to teach the things he knew. But, “they” rejected the overall person for his 'black” identity. The poet doesn't mind it and shows his love for the country without any disgrace to her. He doesn't even hate white men. That's why some of the “best friends” of the poet “are white”. "
570,"The blushing dawn the easy illumes,
The birds their merry matins sing,
The buds breath forth their sweet perfumes,
And butterflies are on the wing.
I pause beneath the window high,
The door is locked, the house is quiet;
'Tis there, abed, she sure must lie, -
To Wake her, - ah! I'll try it.
And pebbles hurtling through the air,
Strike full upon the window-pane,
Awakening her who slumbers there
With their insistent hurricane.
Ye gods! in my imagination,
The wondrous scene do I behold -
A nymph's bewildered consternation
At summons thus so fierce and bold.
A moment passes, then I see
The gauzy curtains drawn aside,
And sweet eyes beaming down on me,
And then a window upward glide.
Fair as the morn, with rosy light,
She blushes with a faint surprise,
Then thinking of the previous night,
In dulcet tones she softly cries:
""It should have been put out by Nan,
But I'll be down within a minute -
No, never mind, leave your own can,
And put two quarts, please, in it.""","The blushing dawn the easy illumes, the birds their merry matins sing,                The buds breath forth their sweet perfumes,                And butterflies are on the wing.                The door is locked, the house is quiet;                'Tis there, abed, she sure must lie, -                To Wake her, - ah!

The poem begins with the speaker describing the idyllic scene which is created by the rising of the sun. Everything appears pristine and peaceful. He is standing underneath the window of a house in which the woman he loves is sleeping. In order to wake her, he throws a number of pebbles at her window. He imagines her waking up, bewildered. Eventually, the woman comes to the window, and the whole mood of the poem changes. She apologizes for not having set out the milk cans the night before. She concludes the interaction by asking him to leave “two quarts.”"
571,"To him who in the love of Nature holds Communion with her visible forms, she speaks A various language; for his gayer hours She has a voice of gladness, and a smile And eloquence of beauty, and she glides Into his darker musings, with a mild And healing sympathy, that steals away Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts Of the last bitter hour come like a blight Over thy spirit, and sad images Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall, And breathless darkness, and the narrow house, Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;— Go forth, under the open sky, and list To Nature’s teachings, while from all around—
Earth and her waters, and the depths of air—
Comes a still voice—
Yet a few days, and thee The all-beholding sun shall see no more In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground, Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears, Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again,
And, lost each human trace, surrendering up Thine individual being, shalt thou go To mix for ever with the elements, To be a brother to the insensible rock And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould. Yet not to thine eternal resting-place Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down With patriarchs of the infant world—with kings, The powerful of the earth—the wise, the good, Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past, All in one mighty sepulchre. The hills Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun,—the vales Stretching in pensive quietness between; The venerable woods—rivers that move In majesty, and the complaining brooks That make the meadows green; and, poured round all, Old Ocean’s gray and melancholy waste,— Are but the solemn decorations all Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun, The planets, all the infinite host of heaven, Are shining on the sad abodes of death, Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread The globe are but a handful to the tribes That slumber in its bosom.—Take the wings Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness, Or lose thyself in the continuous woods Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound, Save his own dashings—yet the dead are there: And millions in those solitudes, since first The flight of years began, have laid them down In their last sleep—the dead reign there alone.
So shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw In silence from the living, and no friend Take note of thy departure? All that breathe Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh
When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care Plod on, and each one as before will chase His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave Their mirth and their employments, and shall come
And make their bed with thee. As the long train Of ages glide away, the sons of men, The youth in life’s green spring, and he who goes In the full strength of years, matron and maid, The speechless babe, and the gray-headed man— Shall one by one be gathered to thy side, By those, who in their turn shall follow them. So live, that when thy summons comes to join The innumerable caravan, which moves To that mysterious realm, where each shall take His chamber in the silent halls of death, Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night, Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave, Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.","To him who in the love of Nature holds Communion with her visible forms, she speaks a various language.

Throughout the lines of this fairly long poem, Bryant speaker talks directly to a listener who has professed fear of dying. He spends time describing the long history of death and the many wise and important men and women who already reside there. You, the speaker says, will rest alongside them at peace with the world. The earth, which once nurtured you, will reclaim your body. The speaker explains how the world of the dead vastly outnumbers the world of the living and that it is better to live accepting death rather than fighting against it. This is the only way to enter into death well."

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker talks to a deceased fly that he's found crushed in a book. He interprets its death as accidental, as though someone closed the book on it without meaning to. Despite this, he marvels over the fly's wings and the imprint it left of its life. As the poem progresses, he turns to talk about human life and death and how everyone is going to get crushed in the book of death eventually. But, unlike the fly, humanity won't leave behind something as beautiful as the shimmer of the fly's wings on the book pages."
573,"A snake came to my water-trough
On a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,
To drink there.
In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob tree
I came down the steps with my pitcher
And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the trough
before me.
He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom
And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over
the edge of the stone trough
And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,
And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small clearness,
He sipped with his straight mouth,
Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,
Silently.
Someone was before me at my water-trough,
And I, like a second-comer, waiting.
He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,
And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,
And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused
a moment,
And stooped and drank a little more,
Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels
of the earth
On the day of Sicilian July, with Etna smoking.
The voice of my education said to me
He must be killed,
For in Sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold
are venomous.
And voices in me said, If you were a man
You would take a stick and break him now, and finish him off.
But must I confess how I liked him,
How glad I was he had come like a guest in quiet, to drink
at my water-trough
And depart peaceful, pacified, and thankless,
Into the burning bowels of this earth?
Was it cowardice, that I dared not kill him?
Was it perversity, that I longed to talk to him?
Was it humility, to feel so honoured?
I felt so honoured.
And yet those voices:
If you were not afraid, you would kill him!
And truly I was afraid, I was most afraid,
But even so, honoured still more
That he should seek my hospitality
From out the dark door of the secret earth.
He drank enough
And lifted his head, dreamily, as one who has drunken,
And flickered his tongue like a forked night on the air, so black,
Seeming to lick his lips,
And looked around like a god, unseeing, into the air,
And slowly turned his head,
And slowly, very slowly, as if thrice adream,
Proceeded to draw his slow length curving round
And climb again the broken bank of my wall-face.
And as he put his head into that dreadful hole,
And as he slowly drew up, snake-easing his shoulders,
and entered farther,
A sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into
that horrid black hole,
Deliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing
himself after,
Overcame me now his back was turned.
I looked round, I put down my pitcher,
I picked up a clumsy log
And threw it at the water-trough with a clatter.
I think it did not hit him,
But suddenly that part of him that was left behind convulsed
in an undignified haste,
Writhed like lightning, and was gone
Into the black hole, the earth-lipped fissure in the wall-front,
At which, in the intense still noon, I stared with fascination.
And immediately I regretted it.
I thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act!
I despised myself and the voices of my accursed human education.
And I thought of the albatross,
And I wished he would come back, my snake.
For he seemed to me again like a king,
Like a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld,
Now due to be crowned again.
And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords
Of life.
And I have something to expiate:
A pettiness.","A snake came to my water-trough on a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,                To drink there.

Lawrence describes a speaker's various interactions with a snake that came to drink at his water-trough. The poem begins with the speaker describing coming upon the snake in his pyjamas. He was unprepared to see it but immediately happy it was there. Although pleased to see the animal, and more than willing to wait his turn, his inner voice was talking to him. The “voice of his education” was telling him to kill the snake—that he was only refraining from doing so because he was a coward. The speaker admits that he was frightened of the snake, but did not want to drive it away. He liked looking at it and felt honored that it had come to him. Finally, the snake stopped drinking and wriggled through a hole in the wall. The speaker didn't like to watch this happen and threw a log at the wall. This only causes the snake to disappear faster and makes the speaker feel regret for his petty action. This is something he says he has to atone for at the end of 'Snake.' Although Snake is quoted in full below, you can also read the poem at here."

The speaker looks down at the peacock that has been “iced” onto her hand and then around at the shops. She feels a connection to the market stalls and mannequins in the shop windows with their western-style wigs. She wants to remember this moment, hold onto it, and force to it become part of herself. She looks forward in time and sees herself returning home with the henna tattoo, picking off the dark brown lines and watching the light brown markings fade over the next days. She will have a temporary connection to this place for which she will always yearn."

576,"I’m rising five” he said
“Not four” and the little coils of hair
Un-clicked themselves upon his head.
His spectacles, brimful of eyes to stare
At me and the meadow, reflected cones of light
Above his toffee-buckled cheeks. He’d been alive
Fifty-six months or perhaps a week more;
_____________Not four
But rising five.

Around him in the field, the cells of spring
Bubbled and doubled; buds unbuttoned; shoot
And stem shook out the creases from their frills,
And every tree was swilled with green.
It was the season after blossoming,
Before the forming of the fruit:
_____Not May
But rising June._____

And in the sky
The dust dissected the tangential light:
_____Not day
But rising night;
_____Not now
But rising soon.

The new buds push the old leaves from the bough.

Throwing away his toffee-wrappers. We never see the flower,

But only the rot in the fruit. We look for the marriage bed
In the baby’s cradle; we look for the grave in the bed;

He’d been alive                Fifty-six months or perhaps a week more. ‘We drop our youth behind us like a boy throwing away his toffee-wrappers.’,"'Rising Five' by Norman Nicholson describes how one's perspective on life and time changes from birth, to childhood, adulthood, and to old age. The poem begins with the speaker reflecting on the words of his child, or a child in his care. The child claims to be “rising five” rather than four years old. He is looking into the future, towards increased age, as a positive. This is something that scares the speaker and sends him into layers of contemplation about his environment and what it means to live. He looks around him and sees the landscape is gracefully changing. It is no longer winter, but “rising spring.” He broadens his view further, up to the sky, and sees that the sun is setting. The day no longer exists, it is “rising night.” In the final stanza, he reflects on how one considers the process of aging while young, and how that changes with marriage and parenthood. By the end of the poem he sees living not as life but as “rising death.”"
577,"“There must be some way out of here,” said the joker to the thief
“There’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth”
“No reason to get excited,” the thief, he kindly spoke
“There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we’ve been through that, and this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late”
All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl","“There must be some way out of here,” said the joker to the thief. “There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke” “But you and I, we’ve been through that, and this is not our fate”","All Along the Watchtower' by Bob Dylan is a beautiful and complex song that describes a coming conflict between two societal opposites. The song describes in sparse detail the lives of a joker and a thief. They are outside the walls of society and they know it. The former expresses concern over their life and what value there is in what they accomplish. Dylan's thief immediately calms him down and directs this short storyline towards its conclusion. The two riders are arriving at a walled castle of some kind. There, in a suspenseful atmosphere, something is going to happen."
578,"Ere on my bed my limbs I lay,
It hath not been my use to pray
With moving lips or bended knees;
But silently, by slow degrees,
My spirit I to Love compose,
In humble trust mine eye-lids close,
With reverential resignation
No wish conceived, no thought exprest,
Only a sense of supplication;
A sense o'er all my soul imprest
That I am weak, yet not unblest,
Since in me, round me, every where
Eternal strength and Wisdom are.

But yester-night I prayed aloud
In anguish and in agony,
Up-starting from the fiendish crowd
Of shapes and thoughts that tortured me:
A lurid light, a trampling throng,
Sense of intolerable wrong,
And whom I scorned, those only strong!
Thirst of revenge, the powerless will
Still baffled, and yet burning still!
Desire with loathing strangely mixed
On wild or hateful objects fixed.
Fantastic passions! maddening brawl!
And shame and terror over all!
Deeds to be hid which were not hid,
Which all confused I could not know
Whether I suffered, or I did:
For all seemed guilt, remorse or woe,
My own or others still the same
Life-stifling fear, soul-stifling shame.

So two nights passed: the night's dismay
Saddened and stunned the coming day.
Sleep, the wide blessing, seemed to me
Distemper's worst calamity.
The third night, when my own loud scream
Had waked me from the fiendish dream,
O'ercome with sufferings strange and wild,
I wept as I had been a child;
And having thus by tears subdued
My anguish to a milder mood,
Such punishments, I said, were due
To natures deepliest stained with sin,—
For aye entempesting anew
The unfathomable hell within,
The horror of their deeds to view,
To know and loathe, yet wish and do!
Such griefs with such men well agree,
But wherefore, wherefore fall on me?
To be loved is all I need,
And whom I love, I love indeed.","Ere on my bed my limbs I lay, with no thought exprest, only a sense of supplication; a sense o'er all my soul imprest that I am weak, yet not unblest.

But yester-night I prayed aloud in anguish and in agony, in pain and anguish.","'The Pains of Sleep' by Samuel Taylor Coleridge describes a period in a speaker's life in which he is besieged by terrible imagery. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he has been lying in his bed for an extended period of time, unable to move. He does the only type of prayer he knows how, and turns his soul over from “reverential resignation” to “Love.” This action should cleanse his restlessness and purify the thoughts he's been having. As the poem continues on the speaker describes what the last two nights of his life have been like. He has seen a variety of terrible images that wake him screaming from sleep. All of these sights represent the horrors that mankind is capable of, and by default, the speaker himself. By the end of the piece, he is asking, almost desperately, why it is that he is the one who has to bear the responsibility of these images."
579,"There was a sunlit absence.
The helmeted pump in the yard
heated its iron,
water honeyed

in the slung bucket

like a griddle cooling
against the wall

of each long afternoon.
So, her hands scuffled
over the bakeboard,
the reddening stove

sent its plaque of heat
against her where she stood
in a floury apron
by the window.

Now she dusts the board
with a goose’s wing,
now sits, broad-lapped,
with whitened nails

and measling shins:
here is a space
again, the scone rising
to the tick of two clocks.

In the first lines of 'Mossbawn: Sunlight', the speaker gives a few details about the exterior of his aunt's home. The sun plays an important role, heating the scene. The warmth is continued within the house, emanating from the stove in which Mary Heaney cooks. He remembers how she moved through the kitchen, dusted the rooms, as well as how her love went into everything she did."
580,"My father’s in my fingers, but my mother’s in my palms.
I lift them up and look at them with pleasure –
I know my parents made me by my hands.

They may have been repelled to separate lands,
to separate hemispheres, may sleep with other lovers,
but in me they touch where fingers link to palms.

With nothing left of their togetherness but friends
who quarry for their image by a river,
at least I know their marriage by my hands.
I shape a chapel where a steeple stands.
And when I turn it over,
my father’s by my fingers, my mother’s by my palms

demure before a priest reciting psalms.
My body is their marriage register.
I re-enact their wedding with my hands.

for mirroring in bodies of the future.

I’ll bequeath my fingers, if you bequeaths your palms. We know our parents make us by our hands.","“Genetics” by Sinéad Morrissey speaks on the composition of one's body and how one is made of their mother, father, and their combined history. The poem begins with the speaker describing how her fingers resemble those of her father and her palms resemble her mother's. This is a fact that is deeply important to the speaker. It is this connection that allows her to feel that she is still a part of a cohesive family. These parts of her hands keep her family together even after they have split up. Her parents are no longer together, there is a lot of physical and emotional distance between them, but she keeps them connected through a “marriage” of fingers and palms. The speaker even goes so far as to create a marriage ceremony of sorts amongst all her fingers and her palms. Through this act, she is hoping to solidity their marital connection and family bonds. The poem concludes with the speaker considering a future child she could have with her partner and the history that will then be in that child's hands. She is ready to embark on this future, even though her own parents were unsuccessful."
581,"There once was a tiger, terrible and tough,
who said “I don’t think tigers are stylish enough.
They put on only orange and stripes of fierce black.
Fine and fancy fashion is what they mostly lack.
Even though they proudly
speak most loudly,
so that the jungle shakes
and every eye awakes—
Even though they slither
hither and thither
in such a wild way
that few may care to stay—
to be tough just isn’t enough.”
These things the tiger said,
And growled and tossed his head,
and rushed to the jungle fair
for something fine to wear.

Then!—what a hoot and yell
upon the jungle fell
The rhinoceros rasped!
The elephant gasped!
“By all that’s sainted!”
said wolf—and fainted.

The crocodile cried.
The lion sighed.
The leopard sneered.
The jaguar jeered.
The antelope shouted.
The panther pouted.
Everyone screamed

that ever could be
in history
a tiger who loves
to wear white gloves.
White gloves are for girls
with manners and curls
and dresses and hats and bow-ribbons.
That’s the way it always was
and rightly so, because
it’s nature’s nice decree
that tiger folk should be
not dainty, but daring,
and wisely wearing
what’s fierce as the face,
not whiteness and lace!”

They shamed him and shamed him—
till none could have blamed him,
when at last, with a sigh
and a saddened eye,
and in spite of his love,
he took off each glove,
and agreed this was meant
all to prevail:
each tiger content
with his lashing tail
and satisfied
with his strong striped hide.","There once was a tiger, terrible and tough, who said “I don’t think tigers are stylish enough.” He then rushed to the jungle fair for something fine to wear.

The speaker describes the tiger's desire to set aside his toughness and jazz up his outfit. He wants to wear white gloves just for the pleasure of it. But, as soon as he gets them the other animals react poorly. They make fun of him and shame him until he has to take them off, dejectedly."

In these lines, Wiesel moves away from his traditional narration style that's used throughout the rest of the book and considers how this one night of his life changed him forever. He speaks on the smoke, the stillness and quiet, and how if he lived as long as God he'd never forget what he saw and felt. "
583,"The sense of danger must not disappear:
The way is certainly both short and steep,
However gradual it looks from here;
Look if you like, but you will have to leap.

Tough-minded men get mushy in their sleep
And break the by-laws any fool can keep;
It is not the convention but the fear
That has a tendency to disappear.

The worried efforts of the busy heap,
The dirt, the imprecision, and the beer
Produce a few smart wisecracks every year;
Laugh if you can, but you will have to leap.

The clothes that are considered right to wear
Will not be either sensible or cheap,
So long as we consent to live like sheep
And never mention those who disappear.

But to rejoice when no one else is there

Auden is all about taking risks in life and having an action-oriented mind. In this poem, Auden talks about how sometimes people should embrace uncertainty in life. His speaker refers to the very presence of danger in each step of life. It is crucial for his friend if he wants to do great things in his life. The way things are supposed to be done might not change, but the fear of doing something uniquely should be eliminated. People who constantly worry about the outcomes and take everything too seriously might not be able to live to the fullest. They fail to recognize the chances and restrain themselves due to their cautiousness. Furthermore, Auden comments upon society “consenting” to live as mere sheep. People tend to follow the flock or the way others lead their lives. They never take a route of their own. The speaker counsels against this mindset throughout the poem."
584,"Of course I remember Joseph
Fifty press-ups before a night out,
hair sheened with gel,
air dead with scent when he passed.

Told us all how he got his red wings
over the bandstand railing.

White tights shed to high heels.

How he would stand at the bar,
stroking his chest with one hand,
drinking with the other;
the making of a small town myth -

Jones is vulgar, playing the role of a stereotypical small-town masculine male. There is a sense of dislike within the poem, with Sheers looking down on the crass character.

This is not a glamorized role, with the character being crude, misogynistic, and dislikable."

Had ushered in

That hidden freshness sung,
That certainty of time laid up in store
As when she played them first. But, even more,

The glare of that much-mentionned brilliance, love,
Broke out, to show
Its bright incipience sailing above,
Still promising to solve, and satisfy,

Our love is old and sure, not new and frantic, he writes. And saying that has made me feel romantic, he adds.","'Another Valentine' by Wendy Cope presents the real meaning of Valentine's day and most importantly the meaning of romantic love. This poem begins with the poetic persona's ironic statement. In modern times, people are obliged to be romantic as it does not come from the heart. Hence, the poet thinks otherwise. Everyone knows the rules that can be observed throughout the world. So modern lovers “have to be romantic” for the sake of pedantic customs. However, the speaker or the poet's persona says her love is “old and sure.” It's not new or frantic. Yet the speaker still feels the same vibes that she felt during the first few days of her relationship. For this reason, she says that the emotion lying at the deepest core of the heart makes her feel romantic, not Valentine's Day."

See us gathered on behalf
Of love according to the gospel

Catechumens make their entrance;
Steep enthusiastic eyes
Flicker after tits and baskets;

Lilian is afraid of kids;
The Love that rules the sun and stars
Permits what He forbids.

In a sinner’s lap lies curled;
Drunken absent-minded fingers
Pat a sinless world.

588,"As my new life begins, I start smiling at the people around me,
You would think I’d just been given a substantial meal,
I see all their good points.
The railroad sheds are full of greenish-yellow electricity,
It’s the great mad-day hour in London...that suddenly goes brown.
...My stupefying efforts make money
And to have a life!
Well, I’m leaving; nothing can hold me.


The platforms are dense to the foot,
Rich, strong-willed travellers pace about in the dark daylight,
And how they stink of green fatty soaps, the rich.
More dirty weather...you can hardly see the newspaper stand
With its abominable, ludicrous papers...which are so touching
I ought to laugh and cry, instead of gritting my teeth.


Let me inhale the filthy air for the last time
Good heavens, how vile it is...I could take you step by step
Back among the twilight buildings, into my old life...


The trains come in, boiling, caked !
The station half tames them, there’s the sound of blows; the uproar!
And I -- I behave as though I’ve been starved of noise,
My intestinr eats up this big music
And my new bourgeois soul promptly bursts into flames, in mid-air.


No use pouring me a few last minutes of the old life
From your tank of shadow, filled with lost and rotten people,
I admit: the same flow of gutter-sugar to the brain...


No one to see me off -- Ah!
I would like to be seen off; it must be the same agonizing woman
Who does not want to understand me, and who exposes me in public,
So that I can turn away, choked with the cold bile,
And feel myself loved absoltely; the bitch.


These carriages, that have heavy brown and black bread
Up their sides! But look out for the moment of cowardice,
It’s Charon’s rowing-boat that lurches and fouls my hand
As I climb on -- exile, Limboist.


...The way these people get on with thir lives; I bow down
With my few deeds and my lotus scars.
Last minutes...last greenish-yellow minutes
Of the lost and rotten hours...faro, and old winters dimmed,
On which the dark -- Yes, the black sugar-crust is forming, London.


I’m leaving! Nothing can hold me!
The trains, watered and greased, scream to be off.
Hullo -- I’m already sticking out my elbows for a piece of territory,
I occupy my place as though I can’t get enough of it
-- And with what casual, haughty, and specific gestures, incidentally.


Tradesmen, Pigs, regenerative trains -- I shall be saved!
I shall go to the centre of Europe; gliding,
As children skate on the diamond lid of the lake
Never touching gound -- Xenophile, on the blue-plated meadows.


Oh I shall live off myself, rainclothes, documents,
The great train simmers....Life is large, large!

I admit it, at the last.","""I’m leaving; nothing can hold me....I could take you step by step step back into my old life"" ""My intestinr eats up this big music and my bourgeois soul promptly bursts into flames, in mid-air"" ""Life is large, large!...I shall live off your loaf of shadows, London; I admit it, at the last""","Farewell to Kurdistan' by Rosemary Tonks is a sensorial poem that describes London and a speaker's departure from it. The poem takes the reader through a series of images associated with travel, specifically from a London train platform. The speaker depicts the space as dirty, smelly, and loud. It is somewhere she doesn't want to be, but at the same time is longing to be so that she may leave her current life behind. She alludes to her past but gives no concrete details about it. The train arrives, the platform goes into chaos, and she departs. The next sections of the poem speak about her excitement at being on the train and her desire to see other people and places."
589,"It seemed an unlikely match. All winter unplugged,
grinding its teeth in a plastic sleeve, the chainsaw swung
nose-down from a hook in the darkroom
under the hatch in the floor. When offered the can
it knocked back a quarter-pint of engine oil
and juices ran from its joints and threads,
oozed across the guide-bar and the maker’s name,
into the dry links.

From the summerhouse, still holding one last gulp
of last year’s heat behind its double doors, and hung
with the weightless wreckage of wasps and flies,
moth-balled in spider’s wool…
from there, I trailed the day-glo orange power-line
the length of the lawn and the garden path,
fed it out like powder from a keg, then walked
back to the socket and flicked the switch, then walked again
and coupled the saw to the flex – clipped them together.
Then dropped the safety catch and gunned the trigger.
No gearing up or getting to speeds, just an instant rage,
the rush of metal lashing out at air, connected to the main.
The chainsaw with its perfect disregard, its mood
to tangle with cloth, or jewellery, or hair.
The chainsaw with its bloody desire, its sweet tooth
for the flesh of the face and the bones underneath,
its grand plan to kick back against nail or knot
and rear up into the brain.
I let it flare, lifted it into the sun
and felt the hundred beats per second drumming in its heart,
and felt the drive-wheel gargle in its throat.

The pampas grass with its ludicrous feathers
and plumes. The pampas grass, taking the warmth and light
from cuttings and bulbs, sunning itself,
stealing the show with its footstools, cushions and tufts
and its twelve-foot spears.

This was the sledgehammer taken to crack the nut.
Probably all that was needed here was a good pull or shove
or a pitchfork to lever it out at its base.
Overkill. I touched the blur of the blade
against the nearmost tip of a reed – it didn’t exist.
I dabbed at a stalk that swooned, docked a couple of heads, dismissed the top third of its canes with a sideways sweep
at shoulder height – this was a game.
I lifted the fringe of undergrowth, carved at the trunk –
plant-juice spat from the pipes and tubes
and dust flew out as I ripped into pockets of dark, secret
warmth.
To clear a space to work
I raked whatever was severed or felled or torn
towards the dead zone under the outhouse wall, to be fired.
Then cut and raked, cut and raked, till what was left
was a flat stump the size of a manhole cover or barrel lid
that wouldn’t be dug with a spade or prized from the earth. Wanting to finish things off I took up the saw
and drove it vertically downwards into the upper roots,
but the blade became choked with soil or fouled with weeds,
or what was sliced or split somehow closed and mended
behind, like cutting at water or air with a knife.
I poured barbecue fluid into the patch
and threw in a match – it flamed for a minute, smoked for a minute more, and went
out. I left it at that.

In the weeks that came new shoots like asparagus tips
sprang up from its nest and by June
it was riding high in its saddle, wearing a new crown.
Corn in Egypt. I looked on
from the upstairs window like the midday moon.

Back below stairs on its hook, the chainsaw seethed.
I left it a year, to work back through its man-made dreams,
to try to forget.

The poem begins with the speaker going into detail about a chainsaw. He's preparing it for a task, and like a caged animal it is ready to let its anger loose on whatever source the speaker chooses. Armitage makes use of personification throughout this poem, using it to describe the chainsaw as a snarling dangerous animal, but also its victim, the pampas grass. This large plant is located somewhere in the speaker's yard and he's determined to use his very angry chainsaw to destroy it. At first, things seem to be going well. He attacks the plant with the machine and it is felled easily. It is compared throughout these stanzas to something weak, floral, and in the end feminine. It presents a striking contrast against the chainsaw which is all testosterone and unmanaged rage. Things take a turn towards the end of the poem when the only thing left is the base of the plant. The speaker can't get it ripped out of the ground so he sets it on fire. Unfortunately for him, the plant survives and by June it has regrown and nature has asserted its dominance once more over humankind."

I cradled my newborn daughter
and felt the heartbeat
pull me out of shock.
She didn’t know

she folded them. I asked her
was there a place

She didn’t know
what a voice was: her lips
were the shape of a nipple.

In the park the child says:
watch me. It will not count
unless you see. And she shows me
the cartwheel, the skip, the tumble,
the tricks performed at leisure in midair,
each unknown until it is finished.
At home she orders:
see me eat. I watch her
curl on herself, sleep;
as I try to leave the dark room
her dreaming voice commands me: watch.

Always we passed the seesaw
on the way to the swings

the principle of the lever,

I sit near the center,

and keep me suspended

I stunned at the power of the formula.",The author's daughter was born with a rare form of Down's syndrome. The condition means that the child is unable to walk or talk. The child is also unable to see or hear. The author writes about her experiences with the condition in a new book. The book is called ‘The Child’.,"Only Child by D. Nurkse begins by focusing on the moments after the birth of Nurkse's child, holding his Only Child after her birth. He realizes she knows nothing, having just come from the place 'where there was no world', not even knowing 'what a voice was'. He cradles her as he looks at the newborn. The second stanza moves in the child having a voice, asking Nurkse to watch her while 'cartwheel, the skip, the tumble' happen. This second stanza child is demanding, finding her voice, and asking for her father's attention. The third stanza examines a scene in which father and daughter are on a seesaw, with Nurkse writing that she 'has power' to lift him off the ground. This is a metaphor for how influential his daughter has become in his life, able to lift him and control him, despite her 'tiny weight'. The poem is a tribute to parenthood."

The first line tells the reader, quite simply, that God made the fly in “his wisdom”. This sarcastic phrase is followed up by its second half in the second line. It adds that God “forgot” to tell humanity why he made this particularly annoying creature. Nash assumed, correctly, that the reader is going to understand the joke in these lines."
592,"What large, dark hands are those at the window
Lifted, grasping the golden light
Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves
To my heart’s delight?
Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,
In the west I see a redness come
Over the evening’s burning breast--
--’Tis the wound of love goes home!
The woodbine creeps abroad
Calling low to her lover:
The sun-lit flirt who all the day
Has poised above her lips in play
And stolen kisses, shallow and gay
Of pollen, now has gone away

And when above her his broad wings hover
Then her bright breast she will uncover
And yield her honey-drop to her lover.

Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed
Where hangs the swallow’s marriage bed.
The bird lies warm against the wall.
She glances quick her startled eyes
Towards him, then she turns away
Her small head, making warm display
Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway
Her out of the nest’s warm, busy ball,
Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies
In one blue stoop from out the sties
Into the evening’s empty hall.
Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes
Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,
Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,
Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.
The rabbit presses back her ears,
Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes
And crouches low: then with wild spring
Spurts from the terror of _his_ oncoming
To be choked back, the wire ring
Her frantic effort throttling:
Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!
Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,
And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.
Yet calm and kindly are his eyes
And ready to open in brown surprise
Should I not answer to his talk
Or should he my tears surmise.
I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair
Watching the door open: he flashes bare
His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes
In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise
He flings the rabbit soft on the table board
And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword
Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad
Blade of his hand that raise my face to applaud
His coming: he raises up my face to him
And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim
Of the rabbit’s fur! God, I am caught in a snare!
I know not what fine wire is round my throat,
I only know I let him finger there
My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat
Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:
And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down
His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood
Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood
Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown
Within him, die, and find death good.","In the west I see a redness come over the evening’s burning breast--’Tis the wound of love goes home! The woodbine creeps abroad calling low to her lover. The sun-lit flirt who all the day has poised above her lips in play and stolen kisses, shallow and gay, now has gone away.","'Love on the Farm' by D.H. Lawrence is a beautiful and powerful poem that describes some of the many elements of life and death observable on a farm. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker begins by describing the setting sun and a foreboding presence outside their window. They go on to describe a honeysuckle plant seeking out her lover, a bird's marriage bed, and a shed. They speak on the movement of a farmer and a rabbit caught in a snare. As the poem comes to its conclusion, death, or an unnamed and loosely described predator, comes for the speaker themselves."

Dylan's song describes how the things happening around the world pains a speaker deeply. This speaker belongs to the century when discrimination according to color and origin existed, basic human rights were denied, and above all the harrowing air of war was raging everywhere. In such a critical situation, a speaker asks several questions to his fellow human beings. It seems everyone knows the answer to his simple questions, yet they are ignoring reality. For example, he alludes to the World Wars in the first stanza and asks how long this problematic situation is going to exist. In the following stanzas, he taps on the issues of racism, confinement, ignorance, freedom, death, and distress."
594,"I said to Love,

""We are too old in apathy!""","In short form, 'I Said To Love' is a love poem by Thomas Hardy that looks at loss and a sense of regret for what he has lost (referring to his passed wife, Emma). He comes across as having a bad experience with love that has punished him with feelings of remorse and pain come across in this poem. With this pain, Hardy personified Love so that he can take out the pain on the personification of Love. “Love” appears to him as an unkind man who once showed him the positive sides of it. But, now as he has lost his wife, it is giving him extreme distress. He tells love to leave at once and relieve him from the pain he is suffering after the loss of his dear one."
595,"With how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb’st the skies!
How silently, and with how wan a face!

Can judge of love, thou feel’st a lover’s case,

To me that feel the like, thy state descries.
Then, even of fellowship, O Moon, tell me,

How silently, and with how wan a face! What, may it be that even in heav'nly place That busy archer his sharp arrows tries! Sure, if that long-with love-acquainted eyes Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case, I read it in thy looks; thy languish'd grace To me, that feel the like, thy state descries. The octet depicts the lyrical voice's perception of the moon. The poem starts by describing how the moon rises in the sky at night. The lyrical voice personifies the moon (“O Moon, thou climb'st the skies!) and projects his/ own sorrows in the moon (“With how sad steps”). The lyrical voice describes the moon carefully, as an individual being: “How silently, and with how wan face!”. There is a repetition of the word “how” in order to emphasize the lyrical voice's attention to the object that he is describing. The lyrical voice questions about the moon's sadness, and figures that it must be because of “What, may it be that even in heav'nly place /That busy archer his sharp arrows tries” (cupid). The lyrical voice's connection of his feelings to those of the moon is an example of a “pathetic fallacy”, where elements of nature appear to have human emotions. The lyrical voice suggests that the moon is struggling with sentimental problems, as he can see them from experiencing them himself: Sure, if that long-with love-acquainted eyes /Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case”. This furthers the personification and the “phatetic fallacy” mentioned before. The lyrical voice can “read it in thy looks” and the moon appears to be, again, weak (“thy languish'd grace”). This portrait of the moon shows the lyrical voice's assurance about the moon being lovesick. Once again, the lyrical voice compares the moon's state to his, making a direct relationship between the moon's suffering and his (“To me, that feel the like, thy state descries”). Notice how the unusual syntax accentuates the words of suffering that the lyrical voice is expressing. Then, ev'n of fellowship, O Moon, tell me, Is constant love deem'd there but want of wit? Are beauties there as proud as here they be? Do they above love to be lov'd, and yet Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess? Do they call virtue there ungratefulness? The sestet presents a series of questions that are crucial to the lyrical voice. The focus of the poem shifts from the description of the moon to the lyrical voice's reflections about love. This is the typical volta, turn, that occurs in the Petrarchan sonnet. The lyrical voice asks the moon (“Then, ev'n of fellowship, O Moon, tell me”) whether, in the sky, love is treated as “want of wit”. Moreover, he asks if women are as proud as they are on earth (“Are beauties there as proud as here they be?”). This series of questions project problems that the lyrical voice is dealing with. The lyrical voice in 'Sonnet 31′ still has more questions. He wants to know whether the things above like to be loved. Notice the internal rhyme in the fourth line. Moreover, he wants to know if the beloved ones like the ones who are in love with them (“Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess? “). Again, the lyrical voice is questioning and thinking about his own sentimental struggles and his relationship with Stella. The final line continues with the questions and the complaints that the lyrical voice has expressed in the sestet. The lyrical voice asks whether “above” love is despised to (“Do they call virtue there ungratefulness?”). He feels that love is a virtue, but it sounds like his beloved one, Stella, doesn't feel the same way about the lyrical voice's display of virtue and constant love. The tone of the sestet shows that the lyrical voice is deeply wounded and the rhetorical questions accentuate this pain."
596,"The soote season, that bud and bloom forth brings,

In the first part of the poem, the poet outlines all the wildlife and how each living creature is reacting to spring. He uses examples of personification and anaphora to emphasize how the entire world seems to be shedding the winter and embracing spring. But, as he reveals in the concluding couplet, the season is not uplifting him in the same way. His sorrow is only growing worse because of the beauty and joy he sees around him."

Passage to India begins with a description of the new marvel of the modern world and how they are part of God's plan. These works, the Suez Canal, the great American Railway, and the transatlantic cable allowed men and women to know one another in a new way. He sees India as a mysterious and fabled place that once visited, will allow the rejuvenation of his soul. He will return to the birthplace of mankind and be renewed for the rest of his life. The Passage to India is not easy, many have died on the way. That scares the speaker, but not so much so as to deter him from undertaking the voyage. The pull of exploration is like a current running through the human race and he is a part of it and wants to feel the connectivity of the earth. The speaker also takes the time to mourn the downfall of men, like Columbus, who ended their lives unhappily. He imagines that he is on this important journey with his soul and that the two of them are circumnavigating the earth together. After asking himself if he is ready to go further on his journey, the reply is an eventual yes and he commands the anchor to be lifted. While the voyage might seem like a terrifying one, he is protected by God."

The speaker begins 'His Return to London' by stating that he is on a journey from the west to the east. This is a trip that he is relishing. It is taking him from somewhere dark and dreary, to somewhere bright and pregnant with possibility. In fact, London is so special to him, that he sees it as a place of nativity. It is important to him, just like one's spiritual or religious beliefs would be. In the next lines, he celebrates the fact that there are so many different kinds of people in the country. At the same time, he speaks directly to the citizens telling them that London is his home, but something happened that sent him into banishment. Now, he has been called back to his country. He is ready to remain there permanently until he dies. He feels that this will not be too long from now, and hopes that he can be buried in the London ground."

The speaker addresses the location, Brancepeth Castle, and those he will find there: the Roundheads, or Parliamentarians.

600,"Throughout the afternoon I watched them there,
Snow-fairies falling, falling from the sky,
Whirling fantastic in the misty air,
Contending fierce for space supremacy.
And they flew down a mightier force at night,
As though in heaven there was revolt and riot,
And they, frail things had taken panic flight
Down to the calm earth seeking peace and quiet.
I went to bed and rose at early dawn
To see them huddled together in a heap,
Each merged into the other upon the lawn,
Worn out by the sharp struggle, fast asleep.
The sun shone brightly on them half the day,
By night they stealthily had stol’n away.
II
And suddenly my thoughts then turned to you
Who came to me upon a winter’s night,
When snow-sprites round my attic window flew,
Your hair disheveled, eyes aglow with light.
My heart was like the weather when you came,
The wanton winds were blowing loud and long;
But you, with joy and passion all aflame,
You danced and sang a lilting summer song.
I made room for you in my little bed,
Took covers from the closet fresh and warm,
A downful pillow for your scented head,
And lay down with you resting in my arm.
You went with Dawn. You left me ere the day,
The lonely actor of a dreamy play.","Throughout the afternoon I watched them falling, falling from the sky. They flew down a mightier force at night, as though in heaven there was revolt and riot.

The first of the two sonnets focuses on a snowfall, something he compares to “snow-fairies” fighting for supremacy in the sky and then resting peacefully on the ground. He uses personification throughout the piece, until the end when they've “gone,” or melted away. In the second sonnet, the speaker picks his line of thought immediately back up with the word “And.” It appears that the first sonnet has led him to the thoughts he has in the second. He imagines “you,” an unknown listener and the speaker's lover, coming to him and bringing warmth and summer into his home. Together, the two go to bed. When he wakes up, this person is gone as if they left with the dawn as a dream."
601,"First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1932
This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper.
So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear
itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to
convert retreat into advance... In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our
common difficulties. They concern, thank God, only material things...
More important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of
existence, and an equally great number toil with little return. Only a foolish optimist
can deny the dark realities of the moment.
Yet our distress comes from no failure of substance... Plenty is at our
doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply. Primarily
this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed, through
their own stubbornness and their own incompetence... This nation asks for action,
and action now.
Our greatest primary task is to put people to work... It can be accomplished in
part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would treat
the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment,
accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our
natural resources...
...These measures, or such other measures as the Congress may build out of
its experience and wisdom, I shall seek, within my constitutional authority, to bring to
speedy adoption.
But in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these two courses,
and in the event that the national emergency is still critical... I shall ask the Congress
for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis—broad Executive power to wage
a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we
were in fact invaded by a foreign foe...","First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1932. President: ""This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper"" ""Our greatest primary task is to put people to work...

In the first part of the poem, Spender uses two refrains and several other lines to describe the death of a soldier who lost his life while fighting. His death was incredibly important to the poet's speaker. He emphasizes the watch the man had on his wrist as well. In the second septet, or set of seven lines, the speaker describes this one man's death, and the presence of his body brings sorrow to all those who observed it. The man is split from his comrades by the bullet and now proceeds on a lonely path toward death. In the final section of the poem, the speaker alludes to a friend that the deceased soldier left behind. This man is also marked forever by his friend's loss."
604,"Still falls the Rain—
Dark as the world of man, black as our loss—
Blind as the nineteen hundred and forty nails

Nurtures its greed, that worm with the brow of Cain.

It flows from the Brow we nailed upon the tree
Deep to the dying, to the thirsting heart
That holds the fires of the world,—dark-smirched with pain
As Caesar’s laurel crown.

From there it turns out a number of events in the seven stanzas. It is a reference to suffering throughout the history of the world. The thirty-four lines of the poem are divided into seven stanzas, perhaps to symbolize the seven days of the week and thereby emphasize the comprehensiveness of the suffering Christ still endures. The title of the poem is repeated six times throughout the poem, the number six traditionally being associated with humankind, which was, according to Genesis 1, created on the sixth day of creation. She has used a number reference from the Bible to indicate where man failed and God's love persisted."

The instruments mentioned in the first stanza of the poem captures the sound present in nature. After that, there is a reference to the people's activity during the harvest moon. They are pious about the autumnal full moon. Moreover, the third stanza, presents how the cows and sheep react while watching the moon. In the last stanza, the poet presents the main idea of the poem by personifying the “gold fields”."
606,"Dear critic, who my lightness so deplores,
Would I might study to be prince of bores,
Right wisely would I rule that dull estate—
But, sir, I may not, till you abdicate","Dear critic, who my lightness so deplores.Would I might study to be prince of bores, right wisely would I rule that dull estate.But, sir, I may not, till you abdicate.Dear critic,. who myLightness so Deplores.","'To a Captious Critic' by Paul Laurence Dunbar is a short, punchy poem that mocks a critic and the world of literary criticism. The poem begins with the speaker addressing the critic, telling him that he's a boring prince ruling over a “dull” world. It's clear Dunbar feels disdain for the profession, but at the same time, he tells this person that he could do their job far better than they can. In the last line, he calls for the critic to step down from his throne and allow other, smarter people, to take his place."
607,"Is there aught you need that my hands withhold,
Rich gifts of raiment or grain or gold?
Lo! I have flung to the East and West
Priceless treasures torn from my breast,
And yielded the sons of my stricken womb
To the drum-beats of duty, the sabres of doom.

Gathered like pearls in their alien graves
Silent they sleep by the Persian waves,
Scattered like shells on Egyptian sands,
They lie with pale brows and brave, broken hands,
They are strewn like blossoms mown down by chance
On the blood-brown meadows of Flanders and France.

Can ye measure the grief of the tears I weep
Or compass the woe of the watch I keep?
Or the pride that thrills thro' my heart's despair
And the hope that comforts the anguish of prayer?
And the far sad glorious vision I see
Of the torn red banners of Victory?

When the terror and tumult of hate shall cease
And life be refashioned on anvils of peace,
And your love shall offer memorial thanks
To the comrades who fought in your dauntless ranks,
And you honour the deeds of the deathless ones
Remember the blood of thy martyred sons!","Is there aught you need that my hands withhold? I have flung to the East and West. I have yielded the sons of my stricken womb. They lie with pale brows and brave, broken hands. They are strewn like blossoms mown down by chance. And you honour the deeds of the deathless ones!","The poem 'The Gift of India' by Sarojini Naidu sounds like an appeal made by mother India to the world to remember the contribution of Indian soldiers during World War I. It is surcharged with the emotional outpouring of a mother, reminiscence on how her children fought and died during World War I. In the first stanza, the poet regards all the benefits of raiment, grain, and gold unearthed and taken away across the world as gifts from India. The second stanza pictures the pathetic situation of those who lost their lives miles apart from home. The third stanza briefs on the grief brought home by their death. Finally, in the fourth stanza, the poet or the speaker appeals to honor the sacrifices of the Indian soldiers."
608,"Blessing himself with his apron,
the leather black and tan of a rain-beaten bay,
he pinches a roll-up to his lips and waits

the smoke slow-turning from his mouth,
for the mare to be led from the field to the yard
and the wind twisting his sideburns in its fingers.

She smells him as he passes, woodbine, metal and hoof,
careful not to look her in the eye as he runs his hand
the length of her neck, checking for dust on the lintels.


Folding her back leg with one arm, he leans into her flank
like a man putting his shoulder to a knackered car,
catches the hoof between his knees

as if it's just fallen from a table,
cups her fetlock and bends,
a romantic lead dropping to the lips of his lover.

Then the close work begins: cutting moon-sliver clippings,
excavating the arrow head of her frog,
filing at the sole and branding on a shoe

in an apparition of smoke,
three nails gritted between his teeth,
a seamstress pinning the dress of the bride.

Placing his tools in their beds,
he gives her a slap and watches her leave,
awkward in her new shoes, walking on strange ground.

The sound of his steel, biting at her heels.","Blessing himself with his apron, he pinches a roll-up to his lips and waits for the mare to be led from the field to the yard. The wind twisting his sideburns in its fingers as he passes, woodbine, metal and hoofs. He gives her a slap and watches her leave, awkward in her new shoes, walking on strange ground.","‘The Farrier’ by Owen Sheers portrays the story of a farrier attaching new shoes on a female horse. The poem is often interpreted as an extended metaphor to portray the complexities of the relationship between males and females. The archetypical portrayal of the masculine and feminine within the poem convene to present Sheers’ upbringing, being from a strict background in which gender roles were clearly defined.

609,"Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes,
A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life,
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Doth, with their death, bury their parents' strife.
The fearful passage of their death-marked love
And the continuance of their parents' rage — Which, but their children's end, nought could remove —
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
The which, if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.","A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life, with their death, bury their parents' strife. The fearful passage of their death-marked love — which, but their children's end, nought could remove — is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; which, if you with patient ears attend, we shall strive to mend.","Act I Prologue' by William Shakespeare the chorus provides the reader with information about the setting, the “Two households” that the play hinges around and the “new mutiny” that stimulates the action. The prologue alludes to the end of the play in which both Romeo and Juliet lost their lives. It is only due to that loss that their “parents' rage” ends. The lines also specifically address the audience asking them to list with “patient ears” and find out how the events are going to play out."
610,"By the rude bridge that arched the flood,
Their flag to April’s breeze unfurled,
Here once the embattled farmers stood
And fired the shot heard round the world.
The foe long since in silence slept;
Alike the conqueror silent sleeps;
And Time the ruined bridge has swept
Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.
On this green bank, by this soft stream,
We set today a votive stone;
That memory may their deed redeem,
When, like our sires, our sons are gone.
Spirit, that made those heroes dare
To die, and leave their children free,
Bid Time and Nature gently spare
The shaft we raise to them and thee.","By the rude bridge that arched the flood, their flag to April’s breeze unfurled.Here once the embattled farmers stood, they fired the shot heard round the world. The foe long since in silence slept;Alike the conqueror silent sleeps. Time the ruined bridge has swept                Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.","Concord Hymn' by Ralph Waldo Emerson describes the spirit which inhabited the “embattled farmers” at the start of the Revolutionary War. The poem begins with the speaker stating that farmers have gathered at a “rude bridge” on the bank of a river. They have come together in preparation for a battle that they know is coming. The next lines of the poem make clear that it is time for a change. The residents of the Colonies have had enough, and are ready to fight, hand-to-hand if necessary, for what they want. In the last two stanzas of the poem, the speaker describes the dedication of the monument for which the poem was written. He asks God to spare the statue from any of the damages “Time” or “Nature” could inflict upon it as the generations to come to need to understand its importance."
611,"Know'st thou not at the fall of the leaf
How the heart feels a languid grief
Laid on it for a covering,
And how sleep seems a goodly thing
In Autumn at the fall of the leaf?

And how the swift beat of the brain
Falters because it is in vain,
In Autumn at the fall of the leaf
Knowest thou not? and how the chief
Of joys seems—not to suffer pain?

Know'st thou not at the fall of the leaf
How the soul feels like a dried sheaf
Bound up at length for harvesting,
And how death seems a comely thing
In Autumn at the fall of the leaf?","Know'st thou not at the fall of the leaf? How the heart feels a languid grief. How sleep seems a goodly thing. How the soul feels like a dried sheaf bound up at length for harvesting. How death seems a comely thing, and how joys seem not to suffer pain.","Autumn Song' by Dante Gabriel Rossetti describes the pains experienced by nature at the end of autumn and how these pains are translated to humankind. The poem begins with the speaker asking his first question. He wants to know if the reader is aware of the fact that one” heart feels the most grief “at the fall of the leaf.” It is the days of autumn, particularly those which are edging on towards winter which is the hardest to live through. They are marked by an inescapable decay that makes its way through every living thing. In the second section, the speaker moves on to discuss the emotional and mental impacts of the changing season. One's mind will decay alongside one's body. It will be in vain to try to prevent this from happening or make any attempt to outlast it. He also states that this period of time will force one to watch their “joys” suffer. In the final set of five lines death is described as being preferable to the long decay of autumn. By the time the pain sets in, one will be ready to face death. It will be the more “comely” option between the two."
612,"And some time make the time to drive out west
Into County Clare, along the Flaggy Shore,
In September or October, when the wind
And the light are working off each other
So that the ocean on one side is wild
With foam and glitter, and inland among stones
The surface of a slate-grey lake is lit
By the earthed lightning of a flock of swans,
Their feathers roughed and ruffling, white on white,
Their fully grown headstrong-looking heads
Tucked or cresting or busy underwater.
Useless to think you’ll park and capture it
More thoroughly. You are neither here nor there,
A hurry through which known and strange things pass
As big soft buffetings come at the car sideways
And catch the heart off guard and blow it open.","In September or October, along the Flaggy Shore, when the wind and light are working off each other. The surface of a slate-grey lake is lit by the earthed lightning of a flock of swans. Their feathers roughed and ruffling, white on white, headstrong-looking heads.","Postscript' by Seamus Heaney is a short, meditative poem that describes a transitory moment by the sea and the sight of swans on a lake. The poem begins with the speaker telling the reader they should take the time to travel to the Flaggy Shore in the northern part of County Clare, Ireland. There, if they arrive between September and October, they'll see the area at its best. The sea will light up and glitter and there will be swans landing on the “inland” lake. He focuses on these creatures, describing them and their actions in great detail. The purity of this moment should not be violated by attempts to know it more fully. Instead, one should let the emotion rock their body, experiencing it this once in that time and place. "
613,"O golden-tongued Romance with serene lute!
Fair plumed Syren! Queen of far away!
Leave melodizing on this wintry day,
Shut up thine olden pages, and be mute:
Adieu! for once again the fierce dispute,
Betwixt damnation and impassion'd clay
Must I burn through; once more humbly assay
The bitter-sweet of this Shakespearian fruit.
Chief Poet! and ye clouds of Albion,
Begetters of our deep eternal theme,
When through the old oak forest I am gone,
Let me not wander in a barren dream,
But when I am consumed in the fire,
Give me new Phoenix wings to fly at my desire.","O golden-tongued Romance with serene lute! Fair plumed Syren! Queen of far away! Leave melodizing on this wintry day, and be mute:Adieu! for once again the fierce dispute,Must I burn through; once more humbly assay.","In the poem, Keats fights against his ulterior urge to create in order to indulge in one of his greatest passions: that of re-reading the play, King Lear, one of the most influential of all of Shakespeare's work. 'King Lear' is a play about family and misery, duty and birthright, and how one's opinion can lead to tragedy. It is one of Shakespeare's most revered plays, played constantly over the years to crowds of packed audiences; and it is no secret why the play itself is one of Keat's favourites. 'King Lear' is all about artifice and joy and misery, things that Keats himself saw echoed and repeated in his own life, and tried to echo and repeat in his own work."
614,"When Love with unconfinèd wings
Hovers within my Gates,
And my divine Althea brings
To whisper at the Grates;
When I lie tangled in her hair,
And fettered to her eye,
The Gods that wanton in the Air,
Know no such Liberty.

When flowing Cups run swiftly round
With no allaying Thames,
Our careless heads with Roses bound,
Our hearts with Loyal Flames;
When thirsty grief in Wine we steep,
When Healths and draughts go free,
Fishes that tipple in the Deep
Know no such Liberty.

When (like committed linnets) I
With shriller throat shall sing
The sweetness, Mercy, Majesty,
And glories of my King;
When I shall voice aloud how good
He is, how Great should be,
Enlargèd Winds, that curl the Flood,
Know no such Liberty.

Stone Walls do not a Prison make,
Nor Iron bars a Cage;
Minds innocent and quiet take
That for an Hermitage.
If I have freedom in my Love,
And in my soul am free,
Angels alone that soar above,
Enjoy such Liberty.","When Love with unconfinèd wings purposefullyHovers within my Gates,                And my divine Althea brings                To whisper at the Grates;                When I lie tangled in her hair,774And fettered to her eye,774The Gods that wanton in the Air,774Know no such Liberty.774When flowing Cups run swiftly round                With no allaying Thames,774Our careless heads with Roses bound,                Our hearts with Loyal Flames;774When thirsty grief in Wine we steep,774When Healths and draughts go free,774.","To Althea, from Prison' by Richard Lovelace describes a poet's attempts at maintaining his freedom while imprisoned in Gatehouse Prison in 1642. The poem begins with the speaker stating that while imprisoned in his cell his love comes to him and improves his situation. He imagines that his lover, Althea, visits him and takes his confinement away. His imaginings free him from the gates and grates which surround him. In the next section, he recalls moments of happiness drinking with others. These times brought him, and his friends, a freedom which was greater than that known by fish in the sea. They drink to the health of their king, a fact which contributed to the poet's imprisonment in the first place. In the last sections, he describes his ability to sing more shrilly than a “linnet.” This bird's song is not as sweet or loud as his is. His words will glorify the king and provide him with a freedom greater than that known by the winds which turn up a flood. The final lines return to the speaker's lover and he states that their love makes him freer than the angels which “soar” in the sky."
615,"Among the rain
and lights
I saw the figure 5
in gold
on a red
firetruck
moving
tense
unheeded
to gong clangs
siren howls
and wheels rumbling
through the dark city.","Among the rain and lights, I saw the figure 5 in gold on a red fire truck. The figure was moving through the dark city in a fire truck with wheels rumbling through the rain. The fire truck was headed for the city's docks, where the figure was waiting for them.","The first thing, and also last thing, Williams focuses on within this poem is the atmosphere. The keywords from this descriptive field are 'rain', 'lights', 'rumbling', and 'dark city'. The description of the scene, although short, is a sensory overload. Williams hastens to fit in as many sights and sounds as he can during the 31 lines. By setting the poem within this rainy, dark city, the poem takes on an air of nostalgia. By not identifying the city, the reader can self-identify with the poem, reading it into a location of their choosing. Without the appearance of the firetruck, the scene is actually a little depressing. The focus on the 'rain' and 'dark' culminate into a dingy and washed-out image. The sudden appearance of the truck breathes life into the poem, searing itself on the memory of the reader. The lack of sound within the city is also evident by the appearance of the truck. The onomatopoeic 'siren howls' and 'wheels rumbling' culminate together to slice through the silence of the city. This moment, although only a flash is one that sensorially captivates the reader. The flash of 'red' and 'gold', searing as an image accompanying the loudness of the firetruck. This moment is temporary, yet very impactful. Perhaps here Williams is reflecting on the idea of memory, with this seemingly insignificant moment creating such a powerful image. This is supported by the odd elements which William writes, especially that of the number '5' seared onto his brain. It does not always have to be magnificent which is solidified in memory. Speed Movement is one of the key facets of 'The Great Figure.' The slow steadiness of the 'rain' and 'light' beginning the poem is contrasted against the sudden disruption of the firetruck. Interestingly, 'moving' is one of the only words in the poem that has a line to itself, elevating its importance. The fleeting nature of the firetruck can be linked to the transitory nature of time. This moment of explosive action speeds past us and then is gone. The firetruck comes into, and out of, sight in the blink of an eye. Williams could be suggesting that the fleeting nature of life needs to be focused on. Moments happen and then they are gone, most lost to forgetting. Perhaps William urges the reader to be more present, find the extraordinary within the ordinary."
616,"Nights like this: on the cold apple bough
a white star, then another
exploding out of the bark: on the ground, moonlight picking at small stones
as it picks greater stones, as it rises with the surf
laying its cheek for moments on the sand
as it licks the broken ledge, as it flows up the cliffs,
as it flicks across the tracks
as it unavailing pours into the gash
of the sand-and-gravel quarry
as it leans across the hangared fuselage
of the crop-dusting plane
as it soaks through cracks into trailers
tremulous with sleep
as it dwells upon the eyelids of the sleepers
as if to make amends.","Nights like this: on the cold apple bough a white star, then another.exploding out of the bark. On the ground, moonlight picking at small stones                as it picks greater stones. As it rises with the surf                laying its cheek for moments on the sand                .","'Amends' by Adrienne Rich describes the purity of moonlight as it passes over, and soaks into, the face of the earth. The speaker begins by describing the purity of the moon's light and how on certain nights it is more meaningful than others. The night of this poem's telling is one such night. The light emerges from behind an apple tree, crosses the ocean, pauses for a moment on the sand of the shore, relishing in the solidity of the earth, and then begins to climb. The moonlight moves up a cliff face and then comes into contact with humanity. It is forced to travel through gash-like “quarries” and across the vast piles of waste humankind has discarded. It finally reaches the population of the earth and rests of the eyelids of all the sleepers, hoping to “amend” the actions of humanity. The purity of light is being wielded as a weapon for the good of the earth."
617,"Observe the weary birds e're night be done,
How they would fain call up the tardy Sun,
With Feathers hung with dew,
And trembling voices too,
They court their glorious Planet to appear,
That they may find recruits of spirits there.
The drooping flowers hang their heads,
And languish down into their beds:
While Brooks more bold and fierce than they,
Wanting those beams, from whence
All things drink influence,
Openly murmur and demand the day.
Thou my Lucasia art far more to me,
Than he to all the under-world can be;
From thee I've heat and light,
Thy absence makes my night.
But ah! my Friend, it now grows very long,
The sadness weighty, and the darkness strong:
My tears (its dew) dwell on my cheeks,
And still my heart thy dawning seeks,
And to thee mournfully it cries,
That if too long I wait,
Ev'n thou may'st come too late,
And not restore my life, but close my eyes.
Rate this poem:","Observe the weary birds e're night be done, and how they would fain call up the tardy Sun. With Feathers hung with dew, and trembling voices too, they court their glorious Planet to appear. From thee I've heat and light, and my absence makes my night.","'Orinda to Lucasia' by Katherine Philips describes the importance and intensity of the relationship she holds with her close friend, Anne Owens. The poem begins with the speaker describing what the world is like when it waits for the sun to rise. The night seems endless and the sun late to arrive in the sky. This intense wanting of light inspires the birds to cry out to the sky and the flowers to droop in sadness. Even the brook which should be fierce is mourning for the sun. The second stanza is directly related to the first as the speaker compares her friendship with Anne Owens to the sun. Owens, referred to as Lucasia in this text, is as critical to her survival as heat and light are to birds and flowers. For an unstated reason, the speaker and her friend are separated at this point and she knows she won't survive much longer without her. Even though it might be fruitless, she will continue to cry out, like the desperate birds of the first stanza, for Lucasia to return to her."
618,"When I was happy alone, too young for love
Or to be loved in any but a way
Cloudless and gentle, I would find the day
Long as I wished its length or web to weave.

I did not know or could not know enough
To fret at thought or even try to whittle
A pattern from the shapeless stony stuff
That now confuses since I’ve grown too subtle.

I used the senses, did not seek to find
Something they could not touch, made numb with fear;
I felt the glittering landscape in the mind
And O was happy not to have it clear.","When I was happy alone, too young for love or to be loved in any but a way, I would find the day when I wished its length or web to weave. I did not know or could not know enough to fret at thought or even try to whittle a pattern from the shapeless stony stuff.","The poem, Reminiscence, by Elizabeth Jennings is about experiencing love in childhood and adulthood. As the very title of the poem suggests itself that it is about the nostalgic feeling of childhood. The poet, comparing her childhood with the adulthood, says that her childhood was honest and innocent. Love in her childhood was neither complicated nor violently emotional. Remembering her childhood, the poet says that she could live her life as she wished.

On the contrary, her adulthood introduces her to the stony world which asks for meanings of everything. She says where her childhood was full of glittering life; her adulthood taught her about the clarity of life. She says where in her childhood she never felt to understand the meaning of love and other things, her adulthood taught her the reality of life, but she says she doesn’t need such clarity."
619,"Democracy will not come

I do not need my freedom when I'm dead. I cannot live on tomorrow's bread.","Democracy' by Langston Hughes is a direct and powerful poem that asks the reader to reassess their ideas about freedom and democracy. In the short lines of this poem, the speaker makes the argument that they deserve to be free and “stand” on the “land” as much as “you” do. They have thus far been denied equal rights but it's time for things to change. Incremental change, he adds, or the promise of change in the future is not enough. He and all those in the Black community (or anyone who has been disenfranchised for that matter) want and deserve the same rights as those in power."
620,"I am the ghost of Shadwell Stair.
Along the wharves by the water-house,
And through the cavernous slaughter-house,
I am the shadow that walks there.
Yet I have flesh both firm and cool,
And eyes tumultuous as the gems

When dusk sails wavering down the pool.

Where I watch always; from the banks
Dolorously the shipping clanks
And after me a strange tide turns.

I have flesh both firm and cool, and eyes tumultuous as the gems.","'Shadwell Stair' by Wilfred Owen describes a haunted track of docks in London and the emotional turmoil of the ghost that frequents them. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is in fact a ghost, and spends his nights walking the “wharves” and “slaughter-house” around Shadwell Stair. He considers himself to be “the shadow” that walks and lives there. He continues on to state that while he may be a ghost, he is not without physical form. He still feels things, and his skin is cold to the touch. Additionally, he says that his eyes are like the reflections of lights in the water of the Thames. In the second half of the poem, the peaceful imagery has come to an end, and the speaker describes the turmoil he feels as night ends. He has walked until the stars are gone and conclude his wanderings by laying down beside another ghost. Explore more Wilfred Owen poems."

The red fire blazes, the grey smoke towers.Sing a song of seasons!Something bright in all!Flowers in the summer,Fires in the fall!","Autumn Fires' by Robert Louis Stevenson is a straightforward, celebratory poem that compares autumn colors to a raging wildfire. In this short poem's stanzas, Stevenson celebrates the changes that come as the autumn season begins. All around the landscape, he can see the red fires of changing leaves burning. From the bountiful summer to the dryer, more colorful fall, this change is to be appreciated. He also uses repetition several times in these lines to note the presence of metaphorical smoke."

The poem begins with the speaker, a customer, asking a vendor what he is selling. This person gives him details regarding the turbans, rich mirrors, and daggers, as well as beautifully stitched tunics he has for sale. The text progresses quickly to the next stall where the same, or possibly a new, customer inquiries about the “lentils, rice” and spices being sold. Again, they receive an appealing description of the items. In the third stanza, the speaker becomes interested in what the “goldsmith” is making. This stanza is more in-depth as the goldsmith focuses on three different ways he treats gold. He is seeking to show off his products and his skill. He can hammer something thin enough for the leg of a pigeon, or forge something sturdy enough for a king. In the fourth stanza, the speaker inquires about three different types of instruments and fruits. These products almost all originate from the Indian subcontinent and are added into the piece in order to further praise the Indian culture. The final stanza describes in greater detail than any of the previous stanzas what the materials for sale are going to be used for. In this section, the speaker asks “flower-girls” what they are weaving. They respond by describing the creation of a crown for a bridegroom and a shroud for someone recently deceased.

The poem begins with the speaker giving the reader a few simple comments about the setting. These provide the backbone to 'This Moment'. She also references things that are about to come but aren't happening yet. Soon, there will be stars in the sky and moths flying in the air. Now though, it is still dusk. There's light on some of the trees and a mother and her child are still outdoors. 'This Moment' concludes with the speaker alluding to the peaceful onset of night. All the things she said would happen are happening."
624,"I see the countless Christmas trees
around the world below
With tiny lights, like Heaven's stars,
reflecting on the snow
The sight is so spectacular,
please wipe away the tear
For I am spending Christmas with
Jesus Christ this year.
I hear the many Christmas songs
that people hold so dear
But the sounds of music can't compare
with the Christmas choir up here.
I have no words to tell you,
the joy their voices bring,
For it is beyond description,
to hear the angels sing.
I know how much you miss me,
I see the pain inside your heart.
But I am not so far away,
We really aren't apart.
So be happy for me, dear ones,
You know I hold you dear.
And be glad I'm spending Christmas
with Jesus Christ this year.
I sent you each a special gift,
from my heavenly home above.
I sent you each a memory
of my undying love.
After all, love is a gift more precious
than pure gold.
It was always most important
in the stories Jesus told.
Please love and keep each other,
as my Father said to do.
For I can't count the blessing or love
He has for each of you.
So have a Merry Christmas and
wipe away that tear.
Remember, I am spending Christmas with
Jesus Christ this year.","I see the countless Christmas trees around the world below. With tiny lights, like Heaven's stars, they reflect on the snow. The sight is so spectacular.

But I am not so far away.","'My First Christmas in Heaven' is a simple, religious poem that addresses God, the Christmas season, and the importance of love. The speaker talks directly to those they left behind. They describe their first Christmas in Heaven and how much better it is than Christmas on earth. The speaker also asks those listening to not mourn their loss but celebrate the happy new world that the speaker has moved on to. At the end of the poem, the speaker tells the listeners that they are sending their love down to earth."
625,"WHAT’S the best thing in the world?

June-rose by May-dew impearled;

Sweet south-wind, that means no rain;

Truth, not cruel to a friend;

Pleasure, not in haste to end;

Beauty, not self-decked and curled

Till its pride is over-plain;

Light, that never makes you wink;

Memory, that gives no pain;

Love, when so you’re loved again.

What’s the best thing in the world?—

Something out of it, I think.","What’s the best thing in the world? I think something out of it, I think. What do you think? Share your thoughts in the comments below or email them to jennifer@dailymail.co.uk. We’d like to hear from you, too.","'The Best Thing in the World' by Elizabeth Barrett Browning describes a speaker's opinion on what the most valuable things in the world are. The poem begins with the speaker asking the reader what they think the “best thing in the world” is. It is clear from the next lines that the speaker has an answer and she's ready to provide it. She goes on to list out a number of features, experiences, and forces of the world she loves the most. All of these, from natural beauty to the south wind and harmless truth, are united by their intangibility. The last lines summarize the fact that the best parts of the world are things that humanity cannot physically grasp on to."
626,"We alone can devalue gold by not caring if it falls or rises in the marketplace. Wherever there is gold there is a chain, you know, and if your chain is gold so much the worse for you. Feathers, shells and sea-shaped stones are all as rare. This could be our revolution: to love what is plentiful as much as what's scarce.","We alone can devalue gold by not caring if it falls or rises in the marketplace. Wherever there is gold there is a chain, you know, and if your chain is gold so much the worse for you. Feathers, shells and sea-shaped stones are all as rare. This could be our revolution: to love what is plentiful as much as what's scarce.","In this famous poem, We Alone, based on humanity, love, and money, Alice Walker reveals the power within each human heart, and the power we have together when united in purpose. She begins We Alone with a strong statement and one that makes the reader stop and ponders the power of the human race. With these lines of We Alone, the speaker communicates to the reader that these musings are a possibility if only everyone would agree to act. The speaker claims that it “could be our revolution” to end the struggle for money and power and begin to value moments of connections with nature and other human beings. The speaker finally expresses a final thought on all that humankind values. She reveals that the revolution could finally happen when people would learn “to love what is plentiful as much as what is scarce”. Thus the speaker presents the idea that human love is what is behind the way the world works. Because we love power and material wealth, we place value on what is rare. However, if we could together agree to love all that nature has to offer, whether scarce or plentiful, we would surely enjoy a more thorough life. Although the reality of this kind of shift taking place is nearly impossible, the words do cause the reader to venture into self reflection and to ponder what true value is. The reader is moved to question his own motives and values as they determine the course of his life.

627,"According to Brueghel

The story was told in the play ""Icarus"" by The Brothers Grimm.","'Landscape with the Fall of Icarus' by William Carlos Williams gives the reader a humanly dark description of a painting by Pieter Brueghel. The poem being with the speaker stating that it was spring in which Icarus fell. The season is depicted by Pieter Brueghel through the trees, the ploughing farmer, and the color choices. Williams takes the season and plays with the “pageantry” of everything associated with it. There are people working, all to the benefit of themselves. In the next lines, he draws a reader's attention to another part of the scene. The young man, Icarus, has flown too close to the sun and is now drowning in the bay. Although this is clearly a tragedy for his father, and for the man himself, no one notices. This is why in the final lines Williams refers to the death as “unsignificant.”"

Inside the wolf's fur, the ragged forest. inside the wolf. foot, the stony horizon.Inside the wolves’ blood, the snow wind. inside its eye, the North star.Inside its tongue, the frozen swap.","The poem “Amulet” is full of cues that predominantly appeal to one's sight. Starting from the inside of the wolf's fang which is purple as heather. The inside of the heather looks like the wolf's fur. The inside of the wolf's fur is reminiscent of the old and grotesque forest resembling the wolf's foot. Its foot, in turn, calls for a comparison to the stony horizon (marks the path of the wolf that it has to tread along until it chances upon its prey in a doe), for the wolf's foot is as hard as stone (Thanks to the long walks!). The stony horizon besides looking like the foot also looks like the tongue of the wolf. Its tongue is as hard as stone (this is one hungry wolf!). The wolf's tongue salivating looks much like the doe's tears. And the doe's tears are hard like the frozen swamp (wolf sure won't fall for tears and won't give up on treating itself to a doe dinner!). The frozen swamp, suggestive of the wolf's inconsiderate and cold attitude, has in it the doe's tears. The blood only next to the attitude of the wolf is chilled. It is chilled by the snow wind as the wolf marches through its habitat for food. As its walk progresses, the wolf looks at the North star hoping it would guide him to his next prey. As he looks at the star one could see his eyes gleam like the star. It may be just a reflection of the star on the eyes of the wolf or it could be the passion of the wolf accelerated by its appetite. Like the wolf's eye reflects the North star, the star has inside it, the wolf's fang."

The speaker takes the reader through the simple elements of a discussion about sacred places. The best example that a student in this discussion could come up with was a car. In it, one can insert the key, worship at the altar-dashboard, and put themselves in motion to go wherever they want to. This depiction of the car felt truthful to all those in the room and no one could fault it."
630,"Whenever Richard Cory went down town,
We people on the pavement looked at him:
He was a gentleman from sole to crown,
Clean favored and imperially slim.

And he was always quietly arrayed,
And he was always human when he talked,
But still he fluttered pulses when he said,
""Good-morning,"" and he glittered when he walked.

And he was rich--yes, richer than a king--
And admirably schooled in every grace:
In fine, we thought that he was everything
To make us wish that we were in his place.

So on we worked, and waited for the light,
And went without the meat and cursed the bread;
And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,
Went home and put a bullet through his head.

Regarding the structure and form, the poem is written in four quatrains written in iambic pentameter with a simple ABAB rhyme scheme. The language is straightforward though quietly stirring. The fact that the rhythm and rhyme are so consistent throughout makes the revelation at the end of stanza four all the more shocking. There is almost a conversational tone to the poem. The frequent use of ‘and’ adds to this effect, loading detail upon detail as the speaker tells the sorry tale of Richard Cory."

The speaker uses the first part of the poem to describe, step by step, the way a man prepares and drinks his coffee. The lines are quite direct and without emotion. As the poem progresses, the speaker moves on to describe how the man smokes, gets his hat and jacket on, and goes out into the rain. All this occurs without the man speaking to or looking at the speaker. This is something that troubles the speaker and leaves them in tears at the end of the poem."

This poem begins with a reference to three distinct things. The first one is a house, the second one is a horse, and the last one is a hound. All these references are compared to the speaker's body. She broods where her soul could sleep, or how it could ride, or hunt without the help of the body. In the last few lines, she asks whether she could hide her soul without her bodily house."
634,"I AM singing to you
Soft as a man with a dead child speaks;
Hard as a man in handcuffs,
Held where he cannot move:
Under the sun
Are sixteen million men,
Chosen for shining teeth,
Sharp eyes, hard legs,
And a running of young warm blood in their wrists.
And a red juice runs on the green grass;
And a red juice soaks the dark soil.
And the sixteen million are killing. . . and killing
and killing.
I never forget them day or night:
They beat on my head for memory of them;
They pound on my heart and I cry back to them,
To their homes and women, dreams and games.
I wake in the night and smell the trenches,
And hear the low stir of sleepers in lines--
Sixteen million sleepers and pickets in the dark:
Some of them long sleepers for always,
Some of them tumbling to sleep to-morrow for always,
Fixed in the drag of the world's heartbreak,
Eating and drinking, toiling. . . on a long job of
killing.

The speaker states that his words are going to depict a world that is deeply depressing, angry, and restricting.He is going to be telling the story of men who were selected for their strength and sent to kill and die on the battlefield. Their “young” blood flowed into the earth as they caused the deaths of others. It quickly becomes clear the speaker does not agree with war, or at least this particular conflict. That being said, he still realizes the men had homes and families. They once had dreams and “games.” In the final lines, he explains that the men remain in his memory because he too was there. He still remembers the trenches, the smells, and the sounds that meant men were about to die or had already."
635,"Across the years he could recall
His father one way best of all.

In the stillest hour of night
The boy awakened to a light.

Half in dreams, he saw his sire
With his great hands full of fire.

The man had struck a match to see
If his son slept peacefully.

He held his palms each side the spark
His love had kindled in the dark.

His two hands were curved apart
In the semblance of a heart.

He wore, it seemed to his small son,
A bare heart on his hidden one,

A heart that gave out such a glow
No son awake could bear to know.

It showed a look upon a face
Too tender for the day to trace.

One instant, it lit all about,
And then the secret heart went out.

But it shone long enough for one
To know that hands held up the sun.","Across the years he could recall his father one way best of all. He held his palms each side the spark                His love had kindled in the dark.

In the poem, an invisible narrator tells of a man reminiscing about his childhood. As he slept as a boy, his father checked on him by the light of a match. The boy awoke to witness this tender moment. With the lit match in cupped hands, the glow projected the shape of a heart on his father's chest. This projection represented the love the father held for the child, a love this nightly action gave expression to."
636,"Here is the House to hold me — cradle of all the race;
Here is my lord and my love, here are my children dear —
Here is the House enclosing, the dear-loved dwelling place;
Why should I ever weary for aught that I find not here?

Here for the hours of the day and the hours of the night;
Bound with the bands of Duty, rivetted tight;
Duty older than Adam — Duty that saw
Acceptance utter and hopeless in the eyes of the serving squaw.

Food and the serving of food — that is my daylong care;
What and when we shall eat, what and how we shall wear;
Soiling and cleaning of things — that is my task in the main —
Soil them and clean them and soil them — soil them and clean them again.

To work at my trade by the dozen and never a trade to know;
To plan like a Chinese puzzle — fitting and changing so;
To think of a thousand details, each in a thousand ways;
For my own immediate people and a possible love and praise.

Useful, commonplace, private — simply a small back-yard;
And I the Mother of Nations! — Blind their struggle and vain! —
I cover the earth with my children — each with a housewife's brain.","Here is the House to hold me — cradle of all the race. Here is my lord and my love, here are my children dear.

The poem begins with the speaker motioning around her to the most important, and only, elements of her world. She has the house, her children, and her husband, her “lord” that is in charge of all she is. The speaker describes the bonds that keep her in the home and how they are the oldest type of chains in existence. They are there no matter what she does and her children and husband are always there to re-solidify them if she ever feels like she could escape. The Housewife continues on to speak on the type of life that the speaker lives and the things that she is allowed to occupy herself with. She can worry about what the family will eat, wear, and how she is to lavish the most praise and love that she can. Beyond that is not her purview. In the final stanza, she states that above all else the most important goal a housewife can hope for is to cover the Earth in children."

S. Thomas focuses on love and how love can endure over decades of life. Yet, at some point in everyone's life, death will come and end all human connections. It is this moment of death that Thomas focuses on within the poem, depicting Death as a device that finally ends his lifelong relationship. Time passes incredibly quickly in the poem, suggesting that even with all the time they have spent together, it still seems too short for Thomas, wanting more time with his lover."

It at once stresses how slow time passes, and how quickly the seasons can change. This focus on the progression of time demonstrates that although some moments are slow and some are fast, time never stops moving. The poem interacts with characters from the city, focusing on activities that the 'junkies' and 'ghetto musicians' do to pass the time within spring. For a poem which is addressing Spring, there is very little imagery of nature, instead of focusing more on the city and its occupants. There is certain melancholia within the poem, the people described being unable to change or escape their circumstances, stuck in a cycle of waiting for the next season forever. "

The first stanza is the longest part of the poem and it is not a coincidence. It is a metaphor for the commandant's predominant personality traits and this is why it dominates so much of the poem's content. In the third stanza, the scene with his child represents a far smaller portion of the poem and this is a metaphor for his spark of humanity. The form of this piece is very clever as it creates a grim image, creates a glimmer of hope in the second and third stanzas, and then ends on a dour note emphasizing the futility of the situation."
641,"I don’t know if the day after Boxing Day has a name
but it was then we climbed the Skirrid again,
choosing the long way round,
through the wood, simplified by snow,
along the dry stone wall, its puzzle solved by moss,
and out of the trees into that cleft of earth
split they say by a father’s grief
at the loss of his son to man.
We stopped there at an altar of rock and rested,
watching the dog shrink over the hill before continuing ourselves,
finding the slope steeper than expected.
A blade of wind from the east
and the broken stone giving under our feet
with the sound of a crowd sighing.
Half way up and I turned to look at you,
your bent head the colour of the rocks,
your breath reaching me, short and sharp and solitary,
and again I felt the tipping in the scales of us,
the intersection of our ages.
The dog returns having caught nothing but his own tongue
and you are with me again, so together we climbed to the top
and shared the shock of a country unrolled before us,
the hedged fields breaking on the edge of Wales.
Pulling a camera from my pocket I placed it on the trig point
and leant my cheek against the stone to find you in its frame,
before joining you and waiting for the shutter’s blink
that would tell me I had caught this:
the sky rubbed raw over the mountains,
us standing on the edge of the world, together against the view
and me reaching for some kind of purchase
or at least a shallow handhold in the thought
that with every step apart, I’m another step closer to you.","I don’t know if the day after Boxing Day has a name. But it was then we climbed the Skirrid again, through the wood, simplified by snow, into that cleft of earth. We stopped there at an altar of rock and rested, watching the dog shrink over the hill before continuing ourselves.","Farther' by Owen Sheers describes a trek up Skirrid Hill which Sheers and his father take on the 27th of December. This poem begins with a clear setting and location, December 27th, on Skirrid Hill. The two characters in the poem, the son, who is the speaker, and the father, in an attempt to become closer, are repeating an activity they must have once found enjoyable, climbing Skirrid Hill. The men do not seem to commune as they progress up the mountain but are consumed in their worlds. The climb is treacherous, but no one is hurt, the ground is steeper than they expected, but they make it to a resting spot. An altar that is “split…by a father's grief / at the loss of his son to man.” This is the reader's first hint as to why the two have grown apart. The son is aging, becoming his own man and the father does not know how to communicate with him anymore. As they continue to climb up the hill the son looks back at his father and can feel how he is breathing and connect those feelings to his own. This is a clue that the two are becoming more similar and this is what is taking them apart. They eventually make it to the top of the mountain and pose for a photo the son sets up. The son is seeking evidence or some kind of proof that they were here, that they did try to fix things. He hopes at this moment that they have made some kind of progress in improving their relationship, but that doesn't seem to be the case. "
642,"O Rose thou art sick.
The invisible worm,
That flies in the night
In the howling storm:

Has found out thy bed
Of crimson joy:
And his dark secret love
Does thy life destroy.","O Rose thou art sick. The invisible worm, that flies in the night. In the howling storm. He has found out thy bed. Of crimson joy. And his dark secret love does thy life destroy. He is the invisible worm. The Invisible worm,That flies inThe night.","‘The Sick Rose’ by William Blake describes the loss of a woman’s virginity through the metaphor of a rose and an invisible worm. The poem begins with the speaker telling the rose that she is sick. This sickness is caused by the “invisible worm.” The phallic-shaped worm comes to the rose at night in the middle of “the howling storm.” There is a real sense of danger and dread in these lines that only builds as the poem progresses and Blake makes use of enjambment. In the second stanza of ‘The Sick Rose,’ the worm finds the rose’s bed. The rose is afflicted with the worm’s “dark secret love” and has its life destroyed. The worm, which clearly represents a phallus, kills the rose—the woman’s, virginity."
643,"Anger,
as black as a hook,
overtakes me.
Each day,
each Nazi

and sauteed him for breakfast
in his frying pan.

And death looks on with a casual eye
and picks at the dirt under his fingernail.

I say aloud.
Man is a flower
that should be burnt,
I say aloud.

is a bird full of mud,
I say aloud.

And death looks on with a casual eye
and scratches his anus.

Man with his small pink toes,
with his miraculous fingers

but an outhouse,

Let man never again write a book.
Let man never again put on his shoe.
Let man never again raise his eyes,
on a soft July night.
Never. Never. Never. Never. Never.
I say those things aloud.","Anger, as black as a hook,overtakes me. Each day, at 8:00 A.M., a baby is sauteed for breakfast. Man is evil, I say aloud. He is a flower that should be burnt. And death looks on with a casual eye and scratches his anus.","‘After Auschwitz’ is six stanzas long with stanzas numbering 8, 2, 8, 2, 12, 1 and there is no rhyme scheme. The poem is a reaction piece, written by a speaker that is filled with anger over the atrocities committed by the Nazis, and more specifically man, during the holocaust. She speaks about her anger, and how it fills her daily; that death does not care about what’s happening and does not take those who really deserve it.

She spends the rest of the poem passing judgment on these men, deciding that they should no longer be worshiped like “temples” or have any agency in their own lives, all in an attempt to stop something like this from happening again. The speaker ends the poem by hoping that God has not heard all she has said allowed, perhaps fearing she is becoming like the men she condemns."
644,"[ A ]

Long ago, in Kentucky, I, a boy, stood
By a dirt road, in first dark, and heard
The great geese hoot northward.

I could not see them, there being no moon
And the stars sparse. I heard them.

I did not know what was happening in my heart.

It was the season before the elderberry blooms,
Therefore they were going north.

The sound was passing northward.

 

[ B ]

Tell me a story.

In this century, and moment, of mania,
Tell me a story.

Make it a story of great distances, and starlight.

The name of the story will be Time,
But you must not pronounce its name.

It was the season before the elderberry blooms,Therefore they were going north. The story was about a boy in Kentucky.","'Tell Me a Story' by Robert Penn Warren describes how the speaker distances himself from the modern world as it left nothing for a person like him. This poem is divided into two parts. In the first part, the speaker shares one of his childhood memories. One day, he was in his native place in Kentucky. There he stood by a road in utter darkness. The sky was dark due to the absence of the moon as well as the stars. He only heard the sound of geese migrating northwards. In the next part, the speaker asks readers to tell him a story. Before they can start, he defines what should be the theme of the tale. It must encompass the theme of distances. In modernity, there is nothing left to be talked about. That's why he tells them to share a story that can rejuvenate his weary mind. It should be a story of delight, not filled with the ravages of modern time."
645,"Quinquireme of Nineveh from distant Ophir,
Rowing home to haven in sunny Palestine,
With a cargo of ivory,
And apes and peacocks,
Sandalwood, cedarwood, and sweet white wine.

Dipping through the Tropics by the palm-green shores,
With a cargo of diamonds,
Emeralds, amethysts,
Topazes, and cinnamon, and gold moidores.

Butting through the Channel in the mad March days,
With a cargo of Tyne coal,

A cargo of diamonds, amethysts, and cinnamon, and gold moidores. A ship with a salt-caked smoke stack.","'Cargoes' by John Masefield is an interesting poem about the history of cargo ships and the cargo that they transported. In the first stanza, the poet explores ancient ships and ports from the Bible and the various items they could've been transported from Ophir. These include apes, peacocks, and sandalwood. The second stanza brings in a Spanish galleon and the gemstones this particular type of ship would've carried. These two different periods in history are juxtaposed with one another as well as with the final. The poet describes a more contemporary, dirty, British ship that carries coal and cheap, uninteresting items."
646,"Just so it’s clear—
no whining on the journey.
If you whine, you’ll get stuck
somewhere with people
like yourself. It’s an unwritten law.
Wear hiking boots. Pack food
and a change of clothes.
We go slowly. Endurance won’t
be enough, though without it
you can’t get to the place
where more of you is asked.
Expect there will be times
when you’ll be afraid.
Hold hands and tremble together
if you must but remember
each of you is alone.

Where are we going?
It’s not an issue of here or there.
And if you ever feel you can’t
take another step imagine
how you might feel to arrive,
if not wiser, a little more aware
how to inhabit the middle ground
between misery and joy.
Trudge on. In the higher regions,
where the footing is unsure,
to trudge is to survive.

Happiness is another journey,
almost over before it starts,
guaranteed to disappoint.
If you’ve come for it, say so,
you’ll get your money back.
I hope you all realize that anytime
is a fine time to laugh. Fake it,
however, and false laughter
will accompany you like a cowbell
for the rest of your days.
You’ll forever lack the seriousness
of a clown. At some point
the rocks will be jagged,
the precipice sheer. That won’t be
the abyss you’ll see looking down.
The abyss, you’ll discover
(if you’ve made it this far),
is usually nearer than that—
at the bottom of something
you’ve yet to resolve,
or posing as your confidante.
Follow me. Don’t follow me. I will
say such things, and mean both.","If you whine, you’ll get stuck with people like yourself, it’s an unwritten law. Endurance won’t be enough, though without it, you can’n't get to the place where more of you is asked. At some point the rocks will be jagged, but that won't be the abyss. Trudge on.","Dunn's 'Before We Leave' explores a journey, it is at once a metaphorical journey to happiness and also a real one, that you must 'wear hiking boots for'. The poet begins by listing things that we must bring on the journey, building immersion into the metaphor before actually launching into it. This journey, it is revealed, is to self-satisfaction, happiness, and avoiding the 'abyss' of depression. It is not an easy journey to take, with Dunn's narrative weaving in and out of metaphor and the literal, the confusion adding a layer to the journey itself."
647,"I found this jawbone at the sea's edge:
There, crabs, dogfish, broken by the breakers or tossed
To flap for half an hour and turn to a crust
Continue the beginning. The deeps are cold:
In that darkness camaraderie does not hold.
Nothing touches but, clutching, devours. And the jaws,
Before they are satisfied or their stretched purpose
Slacken, go down jaws; go gnawn bare. Jaws
Eat and are finished and the jawbone comes to the beach:
This is the sea's achievement; with shells,
Verterbrae, claws, carapaces, skulls.

Indigestibles, the spars of purposes
That failed far from the surface. None grow rich
In the sea. This curved jawbone did not laugh
But gripped, gripped and is now a cenotaph.","I found this jawbone at the sea's edge: crabs, dogfish, broken by the breakers or tossed. The deeps are cold: in that darkness camaraderie does not hold. Nothing touches but, clutching, devours. And the jaws, before they are satisfied or their stretched purpose, go down jaws; go gnawn bare.","'Relic' by Ted Hughes presents the “jawbone” as a relic of the sea. In the end, the poet constructs a metaphorical “cenotaph” with it. 'Relic' by Ted Hughes revolves around the “jawbone” that the poetic persona has found from the seashore. After gripping it in his hand, he looks around and comes across “crabs” and “dogfish” lying dead on the shore. The scene depicts the cruelty of the sea that topples lives. In the second stanza, the poet thinks about the jaw that he is holding. The jaw was active at a time but now it's of no use. Here on the shore, it lies with shells, skulls, claws, and other useless things. In the last stanza, referring to the cruelty of the sea again the poet, at last, portrays that the jawbone in his hand “is now cenotaph”. As the poet writes about it and makes this useless piece of bone a lifetime existence in his poem."
648,"what if a much of a which of a wind

Cummings speaks on the destruction of the earth and the risk humankind poses to itself. The poem takes the reader through a series of three disasters. The first two are related to naturally occurring events, a tornado, and a blizzard. In the third stanza, the speaker introduces the reader to a human-made disaster that alludes to a nuclear apocalypse. Only humanity, the speaker asserts, is capable of produces a disaster from which there is no return."
649,"Here among long-discarded cassocks,
Damp stools, and half-split open hassocks,
Here where the vicar never looks
I nibble through old service books.
Lean and alone I spend my days
Behind this Church of England baize.
I share my dark forgotten room
With two oil-lamps and half a broom.
The cleaner never bothers me,
So here I eat my frugal tea.
My bread is sawdust mixed with straw;
My jam is polish for the floor.
Christmas and Easter may be feasts
For congregations and for priests,
And so may Whitsun. All the same,
They do not fill my meagre frame.
For me the only feast at all
Is Autumn's Harvest Festival,
When I can satisfy my want
With ears of corn around the font.
I climb the eagle's brazen head
To burrow through a loaf of bread.
I scramble up the pulpit stair
And gnaw the marrows hanging there.
It is enjoyable to taste
These items ere they go to waste,
But how annoying when one finds
That other mice with pagan minds
Come into church my food to share
Who have no proper business there.
Two field mice who have no desire
To be baptized, invade the choir.
A large and most unfriendly rat
Comes in to see what we are at.
He says he thinks there is no God
And yet he comes ... it's rather odd.
This year he stole a sheaf of wheat
(It screened our special preacher's seat),
And prosperous mice from fields away
Come in to hear our organ play,
And under cover of its notes
Ate through the altar's sheaf of oats.
A Low Church mouse, who thinks that I
Am too papistical, and High,
Yet somehow doesn't think it wrong
To munch through Harvest Evensong,
While I, who starve the whole year through,
Must share my food with rodents who
Except at this time of the year
Not once inside the church appear.
Within the human world I know
Such goings-on could not be so,
For human beings only do
What their religion tells them to.
They read the Bible every day
And always, night and morning, pray,
And just like me, the good church mouse,
Worship each week in God's own house,
But all the same it's strange to me
How very full the church can be
With people I don't see at all
Except at Harvest Festival.","The author is a church mouse who lives behind the Church of England baize. He lives in a dark, forgotten room behind the church with two oil-lamps and half a broom. The only feast at all is Autumn's Harvest Festival, when he can satisfy his want with ears of corn around the font.","'Diary of a Church Mouse' by John Betjeman is a satirical look, through the eyes of a mouse, at the relationship humans have with their church. The poem comes from the perspective of a church mouse. This creature lives every day of the year within the confines of the church. He's often alone and starving, but he does not move anywhere else. He likes the church and is devoted to living there. He speaks about the different feasts that humans get to engage in and how they don't benefit him at all. But, there is one feast that is different. That is the Harvest Festival. When the church is filled with corn, wheat, gourds, and more, he's able to nibble and munch on these items until he's full. But, there's a catch. At this time of year, the church is invaded by other creatures, mice, and rats, that want to take advantage of this plethora of food. The speaker is clearly irritated by this fact and reminds the reader that he never goes into the fields of other mice and eats their food. They are well sustained all through the year and he isn't. The mice that come into the church once a year are compared to the human beings that do the same. He judges these mice for their selective attendance and is at the same time alluding to that same feature in human churchgoers."
650,"I saw from the beach, when the morning was shining,
A bark o'er the waters move gloriously on;
I came when the sun o'er that beach was declining,
The bark was still there, but the waters were gone.

And such is the fate of our life's early promise,
So passing the spring-tide of joy we have known;
Each wave that we danced on at morning ebbs from us,
And leaves us, at eve, on the bleak shore alone.

Oh, who would not welcome that moment's returning
When passion first waked a new life through his frame,
And his soul, like the wood that grows precious in burning,
Gave out all its sweets to love's exquisite flame.","I saw from the beach, when the morning was shining, a bark o'er the waters move gloriously on. The bark was still there, but the waters were gone. And such is the fate of our life's early promise, so passing the spring-tide of joy we have known.","'I Saw From the Beach' by Thomas Moore addresses life's passions and compares them, through a metaphor, to the changing tides. The poet begins by describing a boat on the water. It moves with the tide, beautifully and powerfully at first (in the morning). Then, when the speaker comes back later, the water is gone and the boat is still there. The soul, as symbolized through the boat, remains, but the passion, symbolized through the water, is gone. This is an unstoppable change but one that the speaker wishes the reverse anyway. He pleads to feel something of the passion of youth/morning again."
651,"What images could yet suggest their range
of tender colours, thick as old brocade,
or shot silk or flowers on a dress
where black and rose and lime seem to caress
the red that starts to shimmer as they fade?
Like something half-remembered from a dream
they come from places we have never seen.
They chatter and they squawk and sometimes scream.
Here the macaw clings at the rings to show
the young galahs talking as they feed
with feathers soft and pink as dawn on snow
that it too has a dry and dusky tongue.
Their murmuring embraces every need
from languid vanity to wildest greed.
In the far corner sit two smoky crones
their heads together in a kind of love.
One cleans the other’s feathers while it moans.
The others seem to whisper behind fans
while noble dandies gamble in a room
asserting values everyone rejects.
A lidded eye observes, and it reflects.
The peacocks still pretend they own the yard.
For all the softness, how the beaks are hard.","What images could yet suggest their range of tender colours, thick as old brocade, or shot silk or flowers on a dress? Black and rose and lime seem to caress the red that starts to shimmer as they fade.

The speaker begins the text by trying to convey how beautiful the birds in the parrot house are. It's hard for him to find the right images to describe their colors and what they make him think of. There is an interesting transition in the middle of the poem when the speaker moves from admiring the parrots to using personification to describe them. The poet uses human-specific interactions and emotions to describe the parrots in less than complimentary detail. The poem concludes with the poet noting that although the parrots looked beautiful, many negative things were going on."

The poetess is in a state of extreme sadness. She implores Waris Shah, her muse, to see what is happening in her beloved birthplace. Corpses are lying in the fields. Everything she sees has turned into red. The land of Heer–Ranjha is playing holi with human blood. The partition of India is the root cause of all those evils. Humanity is at stake. The message of love and purity of compassion is lost from Punjab. The poetess hopes that the people of Punjab will listen to her lamentation and stop this nonsensical bloodshed."
653,"On the edge of dawn’s pale eye,
the trashpickers are lifting the lid of every can,
poking inside with bent hanger and stick.
They murmur in a language soft as rags.
What have we here?
Their colorless overcoats drift and grow wings.

They pull a creaking wagon, tinfoil wads, knotted string,
to the cave where sacraments of usefulness are performed.
Kneel to the triple weddings of an old nail.
Rejoice in the rebirth of envelopes.
The crooked skillet finds its first kingdom
on a shelf where nothing is new.

They dream small dreams, furry ones,
a swatch of velvet passed hand-to-hand.
Their hearts are compasses fixed to the ground
and their love, more like moss than like fire","On the edge of dawn’s pale eye, the trashpickers are lifting the lid of every can, poking inside with bent hanger and stick. Their colorless overcoats drift and grow wings.

At the beginning of the poem, readers can visualize the trash pickers carefully picking up all the trash one by one, checking inside each trashcan, and talking with each other while listing the things they find. It is astounding that some people see things thought of as “trash” in a completely different light by others who pick up that castaway stuff. Old nails, old paper, crooked skillets, and more like objects find new importance having been picked up. Trash offers glimpses into someone's existence and simultaneously speaks a lot about the old owner. It also hints at the condition of the new owner who picks it up. Reading the last stanza, one can understand that the poem is not simply about trash pickers picking up trash. It has deeper layers where the poet observes the things well-off people leave behind, the lasting effect it has upon people and the earth, and how the poor people who pick up those trash stuff weave dreams around those rejected items."
654,"Hail, happy day, when, smiling like the morn,
Fair Freedom rose New-England to adorn:
The northern clime beneath her genial ray,
Dartmouth, congratulates thy blissful sway:
Elate with hope her race no longer mourns,
Each soul expands, each grateful bosom burns,
While in thine hand with pleasure we behold
The silken reins, and Freedom's charms unfold.
Long lost to realms beneath the northern skies

She shines supreme, while hated faction dies:

Of wrongs, and grievance unredress'd complain,
No longer shalt thou dread the iron chain,
Which wanton Tyranny with lawless hand
Had made, and with it meant t' enslave the land.

Wonder from whence my love of Freedom sprung,
Whence flow these wishes for the common good,
By feeling hearts alone best understood,
I, young in life, by seeming cruel fate
Was snatch'd from Afric's fancy'd happy seat:
What pangs excruciating must molest,
What sorrows labour in my parent's breast?
Steel'd was that soul and by no misery mov'd
That from a father seiz'd his babe belov'd:
Such, such my case. And can I then but pray
Others may never feel tyrannic sway?

And thee we ask thy favours to renew,
Since in thy pow'r, as in thy will before,
To sooth the griefs, which thou did'st once deplore.
May heav'nly grace the sacred sanction give
To all thy works, and thou for ever live
Not only on the wings of fleeting Fame,
Though praise immortal crowns the patriot's name,
But to conduct to heav'ns refulgent fane,
May fiery coursers sweep th' ethereal plain,
And bear thee upwards to that blest abode,
Where, like the prophet, thou shalt find thy God.","The poet's poem is called 'The Song of Freedom' and was written in the early 1800s. It was written to celebrate the end of the First World War, when the U.S. was at war with Great Britain. The poem was written by William Shakespeare, who was inspired by the story of King George III and his son George III.","'To the Right Honorable William, Earl of Dartmouth' by Phillis Wheatley is a laudatory poem highlighting the role of honorable William in humanitarian causes. According to Wheatley, when William assumed the office of the Earl of Dartmouth, it brought happiness in most Americans. Here, the poet specifically highlights the happiness of those who were either deprived of their rights or oppressed due to their color. The speaker of the poem knows, the long-lost “Freedom” has come again. Moreover, the Earl would end the tyrannical rule and bring happiness to all. Lastly, the poet compares him to Christ. She thinks like a redeemer he would save the race of Africans treated as non-humans and slaves."

They describe briefly the struggles that they went through to ensure that they created a future that was safe and clear for themselves and for their listener.

According to him, it must be something new, something set upon real places, people, and events. It should not have inhibitions to address unpleasant subjects. Further, he wants Modern poetry to focus on the acts of the mind itself and expects it to help people find satisfaction in their lives itself. It further describes the new demands made on poetry by the complicated and skeptical age. The poet concludes by stating the possible subjects for poetry."
657,"No more thus brooding o'er yon heap,
With avarice painful vigils keep:
Still unenjoy'd the present store,
Still endless sighs are breathed for more.
O! quit the shadow, catch the prize,
Which not all India's treasure buys!
To purchase with heaven has gold the power?
Can gold remove the mortal hour?
In life can love be bought with gold?
Are friendship's pleasures to be sold?
No! - all that's worth a wish - a thought,

Cease then on trash thy hopes to bind,
Let noble views engage thy mind.
With science tread the wondrous way,
Or learn the Muses' moral lay;
In social hours indulge thy soul,
Where mirth and temperance mix the bowl;
To virtuous love resign thy breast,
And be, by blessing beauty, - bless'd.
Thus taste the feast by Nature spread,
Ere youth and all its joys are fled;
Come taste with me the balm of life,
Secure from pomp, and wealth, and strife.
I boast whate'er for man was meant,
In health, and Stella, and content;
And scorn! (oh! let that scorn be thine!)
Mere things of clay, that dig the mine.","No more thus brooding o'er yon heap, with avarice painful vigils keep: still unenjoy'd the present store, still endless sighs are breathed for more.

The poem is addressed to a specific listener who the speaker is trying to get through to in regards to what they value. Up until this point, money has been the controlling factor in their life and the speaker wants to change that. He emphasizes the inability of money to buy love and the impossibility to make a profit from selling friendship. The speaker encourages the listener to get out and enjoy life while they can because eventually, they will be too old to."
658,"""You! What d'you mean by this?"" I rapped.

""I takes 'is name, sir?"" - ""Please, and then dismiss.""

For being 'dirty on parade'.
He told me, afterwards, the damned spot
Was blood, his own. ""Well, blood is dirt,"" I said.

Far off to where his wound had bled
And almost merged for ever into clay.

""It doesn't like our cheeks so red: young blood's its great objection""","'Inspection' takes place during a military parade. A private is singled out by Wilfred Owen, and a Sergeant, for having blood on his suit, although later he admits to Owen that the blood was his own. The poem begins directly with the conversation between a soldier and Owen's speaker. It seems he is the instructor of the parade. He is angry with a spot of blood on the soldier's uniform. Suddenly, the sergeant comes into the conversation and rebukes him for the misbehavior. The offender is confined in a camp as punishment. In the following stanzas, the poet features what the sergeant tells the speaker. He clarifies that blood is “dirt” to them. It hinders them from doing the main task they are entitled to do, which is spilling more blood. To do this task, they must be tidy enough, not bearing the stains of their past activities. Owen, pointing out that it is no excuse, is told by the soldier that the world itself doesn't like them being so alive, and that true justice will occur when they are all dead."
659,"From weariness I looked out on the stars
And there beheld them, fixed in throbbing joy, Nor racked by such mad dance of moods as mars
For us each moment’s grace with swift alloy. And as they pierced the heavens’ serene deep
An envy of that one consummate part
Swept me, who mock. Whether I laugh or weep,
Some inner silences are at my heart.
Cold shame is mine for all the masks I wear,
Belying that in me which shines and sings
Before Him, to face down man’s alien stare—
A graceless puppet on unmeaning strings, I that looked out, and saw, and was at rest,
Stars, and faint wings, rose-etched along the west.","From weariness I looked out on the stars774And there beheld them, fixed in throbbing joy, Nor racked by such mad dance of moods as mars774For us each moment’s grace with swift alloy,774An envy of that one consummate part                Swept me, who mock.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that she is watching the stars and marveling in their movements. They are not out of control as humanity is, but gracefully “throbbing” with “joy.” She sees this as an ideal way to live. In the following lines, she explains how the stars have been able to pierce the darkness of the sky and still shine out for all to see. They have a power that is not controlled or regulated by any other than themselves. In the final section, the speaker wishes that she could live as the stars do— without masks to hide behind or rules to follow."
660,"I dreamed that I ws dead and crossed the heavens,--
Heavens after heavens with burning feet and swift,--
And cried: ""O God, where art Thou?"" I left one
On earth, whose burden I would pray Thee lift.""

I was so dead I wondered at no thing,--
Not even that the angels slowly turned
Their faces, speechless, as I hurried by
(Beneath my feet the golden pavements burned);

Nor, at the first, that I could not find God,
Because the heavens stretched endlessly like space.
At last a terror siezed my very soul;
I seemed alone in all the crowded place.

Then, sudden, one compassionate cried out,
Though like the rest his face from me he turned,
As I were one no angel might regard
(Beneath my feet the golden pavements burned):

""No moew in heaven than earth will he find God
Who does not know his loving mercy swift
But waits the moment consummate and ripe,
Each burden, from each human soul to lift.""

Lonely, to flee from heaven again I turned;
The ranks of angels looked away from me

Over a course of fourteen lines, Helen Hunt Jackson covers the negative effects that dreams have on our lives. She specifically targets how dreams often revive the sorrowful memories of our past and in a way, make us relive the event that we were trying desperately to forget. A driving point in her poem is that we will carry sadness with us until we die. The poem ‘Dreams’ is rich with imagery, and imagery is the strongest device Jackson uses to highlight the main point of her poem. Despite the fact that the poem is entitled Dreams, it does not focus on the general essence of dreams. Jackson explicitly only targets the negative effects that dreams often have when we are compelled to remember our past through them.

Dreams are generally seen as positive, motivating tools that most people look forward to. Dreams are a synonym for goals and aspirations. However, in her poem, Jackson describes dreams as experiences that highlight depression and gloom. The title Dreams can be perceived as an oxymoron, because Jackson means for it to contradict itself. The entire poem can be seen as satirical in nature, because the content contrasts strongly with the selected title, almost in a mocking tone."
661,"Under a splintered mast,
torn from ship and cast

662,"Nothing marks the car quarry now,
just raised earth like the hummock of a grave,
a headstone of trees, wind-written epitaphs
running in their leaves.
Filled in years ago,
but still I can't help standing at its edge,
where the ground once gave
to an elephant's graveyard of cars,
a motorway pile-up in the corner of the field.

One of the places we came
when we had tired of catching
the commas and apostrophes
of minnows and bullheads;
or shooting at pumpkins in the field,
shouldering the kick of your father's shotgun;
or playing at war in the barn,
dying again and again
under its gap-toothed roof and broken beams.


A place where we tested our voices,
young as the buzzards above us
striking their cries against a flint sky,
smashed black holes in the windows,
sat in the drivers' seats, going nowhere,
operated on engines,
dock-leaves and nettles running in their pistons
or just walked among them,
reading aloud from the names of the dead:

Volvo, Ford, Vauxhall,
Their primary colours rusting to red.
Where we lost ourselves in the hours before dark,
year on year, until that day
when life put on the brakes
and pitched you, without notice,
through the windscreen of your youth.
Your father found at dawn —
a poppy sown in the unripe corn.

I came back once, to find the cars smaller
or the undergrowth grown,
whichever, the whole diminished to steel and stone.
Just cars in a quarry,
their dashboards undone and the needles
of the speedos settled at zero.
As I climbed back out I disturbed a buzzard
that flew from its branch like a rag
shaken out in the wind,
before spiralling upwards
above the shuffling trees
and on over the fields —
the spittle sheep, the ink-dot cows,
a tractor writing with its wheels,
and on over the lanes, where a boy
meandered between the hedges,
trailing a stick, kicking a stone,
trying once more to find his way home.","Nothing marks the car quarry now, just raised earth like the hummock of a grave, a headstone of trees, wind-written epitaphs running in their leaves.

The poem takes the reader back to Sheer's own youth and contrasts it with the experiences he has now, as a grown man, as he explores an old car quarry. There, he used to play with his friends and explore their limited freedom. The poem also alludes to the loss of a friend's father, deep emotional trauma, and what it means to grow up and leave one's childhood behind. "
663,"And death shall have no dominion.
Dead men naked they shall be one
With the man in the wind and the west moon;
When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,
They shall have stars at elbow and foot;
Though they go mad they shall be sane,
Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again;
Though lovers be lost love shall not;
And death shall have no dominion.

And death shall have no dominion.
Under the windings of the sea
They lying long shall not die windily;
Twisting on racks when sinews give way,
Strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break;
Faith in their hands shall snap in two,
And the unicorn evils run them through;
Split all ends up they shan't crack;
And death shall have no dominion.

And death shall have no dominion.
No more may gulls cry at their ears
Or waves break loud on the seashores;
Where blew a flower may a flower no more
Lift its head to the blows of the rain;
Though they be mad and dead as nails,
Heads of the characters hammer through daisies;
Break in the sun till the sun breaks down,
And death shall have no dominion.","And death shall have no dominion. grotesquely. They lying long shall not die windily;.Twisting on racks when sinews give way, yet they shall not break;.Faith in their hands shall snap in two, and the unicorn evils run them through;.

Mankind has the power to stand up against any of the evils of death, and become unified through their moving to the next world. Death does not divide but brings together equally all those that lived apart. The second half of the poem focuses on brave and strong men standing up against the power of death and not breaking even through torture and the destruction of beautiful things. "
664,"When the milk-arrow stabs, she comes, water-fluent, down the long green miles.

Her milk leaks into the sea -

blue blossoming in an opal.

The pup lies patient in his cot of stone.

They meet with cries, caress as people do.

She lies down for his suckling,

lifts him with a flipper from the sea's reach 

when the tide fills his throat with salt.

This is the fourteenth day.

In two days, no bitch-head will break the brilliance listening for baby-cries.

Down in the thunder of that other country, the bulls are calling

and her uterus is empty.

Alone and hungering in his fallen shawl,

He'll nuzzle the Atlantic and be gone.

If that day's still, his moult will lie a gleaming ring on the sand,

like the noose she slips on the sea.","When the milk-arrow stabs, she comes, water-fluent, down the long green miles. When the tide fills his throat with salt, he'll be gone.

In the first part of the poem, the speaker describes how the mother seal's instincts pull her to her child for the first fourteen days after he's born. The baby seal feeds and takes all the nutrients he needs from her. But, after a brief period of time, the mother's other instincts take over, and the baby seal is left to fend for himself."
665,"The pockets of our greatcoats full of barley...
No kitchens on the run, no striking camp...
We moved quick and sudden in our own country.
The priest lay behind ditches with the tramp.
A people hardly marching... on the hike...
We found new tactics happening each day:
We'd cut through reins and rider with the pike
And stampede cattle into infantry,
Then retreat through hedges where cavalry must be thrown.
Until... on Vinegar Hill... the final conclave.
Terraced thousands died, shaking scythes at cannon.
The hillside blushed, soaked in our broken wave.
They buried us without shroud or coffin
And in August... the barley grew up out of our grave.","The pockets of our greatcoats full of barley... no kitchens on the run, no striking camp. The priest lay behind ditches with the tramp.

'Requiem for the Croppies' begins with the speaker describing how he, and his companions have “greatcoats full of barley.” They are on the move, or as he says, “on the run”. There is no time for them to strike camp, and there are also no kitchens for them to cook in. The speaker implies that they are being attacked and are forced to flee in their own lands. He is hoping to draw the reader's attention to the aggressive nature of the British forces. These lines also suggest that the rebellion is not as organized as it could be. In the second quatrain, the speaker notes that the soldiers do everything they can to fight off the British. Although they are disorganized, they continually try new tactics. These are not ultimately successful as the final lines discuss the slaughter of these men at Vinegar Hill. The poem ends on a hopeful note, suggesting that the men, or others like them, would in the future once more take up the cause and fight back against the oppressive British regime. "
666,"What The Heart Of The Young Man Said To The Psalmist.
Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
Life is but an empty dream!
For the soul is dead that slumbers,
And things are not what they seem.
Life is real! Life is earnest!
And the grave is not its goal;
Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
Was not spoken of the soul.
Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,
Is our destined end or way;
But to act, that each to-morrow
Find us farther than to-day.
Art is long, and Time is fleeting,
And our hearts, though stout and brave,
Still, like muffled drums, are beating
Funeral marches to the grave.
In the world’s broad field of battle,
In the bivouac of Life,
Be not like dumb, driven cattle!
Be a hero in the strife!
Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant!
Let the dead Past bury its dead!
Act,— act in the living Present!
Heart within, and God o’erhead!
Lives of great men all remind us
We can make our lives sublime,
And, departing, leave behind us
Footprints on the sands of time;
Footprints, that perhaps another,
Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,
A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
Seeing, shall take heart again.
Let us, then, be up and doing,
With a heart for any fate;
Still achieving, still pursuing,
Learn to labor and to wait.","What The Heart Of The Young Man Said To The Psalmist. ""Life is real! Life is earnest! And the grave is not its goal,"" he said. ""We can make our lives sublime, and leave behind usFootprints on the sands of time,"" he added.","'A Psalm of Life' by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow describes the purpose of life, and how one should handle the sorrow and struggles along the way. The poem begins with the speaker contradicting a listener who wants to explain life to him as a matter of number and figures. The rest of the poem is dedicated to the speaker trying to prove this unknown person wrong. He describes the way in which he believes that no matter what death brings, the soul will never be destroyed. Because of this, it is important to do all one can in life to make one's situation, and that of others, better. The speaker comes to the conclusion that he, and the listener, must be prepared at any time for death, strife, or any trouble thrown at them. They must face life, and make the best of every day."

668,"The dead are always looking down on us, they say,
while we are putting on our shoes or making a sandwich,
they are looking down through the glass-bottom boats of heaven
as they row themselves slowly through eternity.

They watch the tops of our heads moving below on earth,
and when we lie down in a field or on a couch,
drugged perhaps by the hum of a warm afternoon,
they think we are looking back at them,

In this poem, Collins shows how the dead are ever-watching on the moves of human beings down on earth. They, perhaps, disdainfully evaluate them by their mundane daily activities. While the living does their jobs, they glide through the river of eternity above and keep an eye on them through the glass-bottom boats of heaven. At times, when the living feels drowsy, lulled by the humming sound of nature, they wait for the permanent closure of their eyes. "

She saw it always, snapping locks and straps,

Although the speaker was always present in the house, she didn't realize that it was due to money concerns that her mother was never truly happy. The speaker states that all the children thought their mother was mean. Now that she is older, the speaker is able to look back on her life and know why her mother acted the way she did. She misses the interactions with all of her family members and still carries a bit of guilt for what she has now, compared to then, when taking a full bubble bath."

The class committee of the school is finding the students of the old batch for inviting them to the reunion at a “hotel ballroom/ festooned with 70s paraphernalia”.

674,"Of all the questions you might want to ask
about angels, the only one you ever hear
is how many can dance on the head of a pin.

No curiosity about how they pass the eternal time
besides circling the Throne chanting in Latin
or delivering a crust of bread to a hermit on earth
or guiding a boy and girl across a rickety wooden bridge.

Do they fly through God's body and come out singing?
Do they swing like children from the hinges
of the spirit world saying their names backwards and forwards?
Do they sit alone in little gardens changing colors?

What about their sleeping habits, the fabric of their robes,
their diet of unfiltered divine light?
What goes on inside their luminous heads? Is there a wall
these tall presences can look over and see hell?

If an angel fell off a cloud, would he leave a hole
in a river and would the hole float along endlessly
filled with the silent letters of every angelic word?

If an angel delivered the mail, would he arrive
in a blinding rush of wings or would he just assume
the appearance of the regular mailman and
whistle up the driveway reading the postcards?

No, the medieval theologians control the court.
The only question you ever hear is about
the little dance floor on the head of a pin
where halos are meant to converge and drift invisibly.

It is designed to make us think in millions,
billions, to make us run out of numbers and collapse
into infinity, but perhaps the answer is simply one:
one female angel dancing alone in her stocking feet,
a small jazz combo working in the background.

She sways like a branch in the wind, her beautiful
eyes closed, and the tall thin bassist leans over
to glance at his watch because she has been dancing
forever, and now it is very late, even for musicians.","Of all the questions you might want to ask about angels, the only one you ever hear is how many can dance on the head of a pin. There is no curiosity about how they pass the eternal time. The answer is simply one: one female angel dancing alone in her stocking feet, with a jazz combo working in the background.","In ‘Questions About Angels,’ Collins whimsically interrogates conventional religious thinking by examining the common phrase: How many angels can dance on the head of a pin? He follows it up with a series of amusing and imaginative questions about angels, emphasizing the importance of having an individual relationship with religion. Collins’ concluding image of an angel dancing in the club suggests that heaven is found not in medieval thought experiments but in the beauty of ordinary life. Instead, he starts proposing more imaginative, even silly, questions about angels. These range from how they change color to what happens when they fall through clouds. He pushes back against the controlling nature of Christian tradition by imagining a single angel dancing in a jazz club, grounding his belief in the present moment."
675,"Sweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,
delightful lily of youthful wantonness,
richest in bounty and in beauty clear
and in every virtue that is held most dear―
except only that you are merciless.

Into your garden, today, I followed you;
there I saw flowers of freshest hue,
both white and red, delightful to see,
and wholesome herbs, waving resplendently―
yet nowhere, one leaf or flower of rue.

I fear that March with his last arctic blast
has slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast,
whose piteous death does my heart such pain
that, if I could, I would compose her roots again―
so comforting her bowering leaves have been.","I fear that March with his last arctic blast has slain my fair rose of pallid and gentle cast, whose piteous death does my heart such pain. If I could, I would compose her roots again, so comforting her bowering leaves have been.","'Sweet Rose of Virtue' by William Dunbar describes the changed feelings of a speaker who no longer understands a woman he used to love. The poem begins with the speaker professing his love for the listener by listing off her attributes. He has, in the past, seen her as being virtuous, gentle, and sweet. She was full of life and beauty that he loved and appreciated. Something has happened now though and she has become “merciless.” In the next section of the poem, the speaker describes following her into her garden and seeing her beautiful flowers. On top of the beauty is something poor-smelling, rue. The poem concludes with the speaker declaring the woman dead. It is unclear if she has in fact died or if he is so upset by the change in her that he has decided she is dead. Explore more poems from William Dunbar."
676,"I must have passed the crest a while ago
And now I am going down.
Strange to have crossed the crest and not to know—
But the brambles were always catching the hem of my gown.
All the morning I thought how proud it would be
To stand there straight as a queen—
Wrapped in the wind and the sun, with the world under me.
But the air was dull, there was little I could have seen.
It was nearly level along the beaten track
And the brambles caught in my gown—
But it’s no use now to think of turning back,
The rest of the way will be only going down.","I must have passed the crest a while ago and now I am going down. It was nearly level along the beaten track and the brambles were always catching the hem of my gown. But it’s no use now to think of turning back, the rest of the way will be onlyGoing down.","Climbing her metaphorical hill, The Long Hill by Sara Teasdale focuses on the uncertainty about when one 'peaks' in life. Teasdale cannot see ahead or behind her, and is therefore disappointed to realize that she 'passed the crest' of her life 'a while ago'. The poet suggests that there is a moment in life when we all reach our 'peak', with everything else just 'going down'. Teasdale's attitude to life is depressing, but hauntingly realistic."
677,"It comes so quickly
the bird of death
from evil forests of Soviet technology
A man crossing the road
to greet a friend
is much too slow.
His friend cut in halves
has other worries now
than a friendly handshake
at noon.",It comes so quickly                the bird of death                from evil forests of Soviet technology                .

'Air Raid' has a rapid-fire opening. The poem immediately takes us to the war setting, where aircraft are literally reigning death on civilians. It doesn't mellow out in the second stanza. In fact, the poem brings us closer to the war using a mundane scenario of friends about to greet each other before one of them is sliced in half. Regardless, 'Air Raid' attempts to dissolve tension at its end by including dark humor. As the speaker says, the dead friend has other worries now than his friendly greeting."
678,"I saw her in a Broadway car,
The woman I might grow to be;
I felt my lover look at her
And then turn suddenly to me.

Her hair was dull and drew no light
And yet its color was as mine;
Her eyes were strangely like my eyes
Tho' love had never made them shine.

Her body was a thing grown thin,
Hungry for love that never came;
Her soul was frozen in the dark
Unwarmed forever by love's flame.

I felt my lover look at her
And then turn suddenly to me, —
His eyes were magic to defy
The woman I shall never be.","I saw her in a Broadway car, the woman I might grow to be. I felt my lover look at her and then turn suddenly to me. Her hair was dull and drew no light; yet its color was as mine; her eyes were strangely like my eyes.","The Old Maid by Sara Teasdale begins with Teasdale and her lover driving in a 'Broadway car', together in the seats. Outside the window, they see an old woman, which bares incredibly resemblance to Teasdale herself. Teasdale looks at the features of the woman without love, her body seems to have withered away from lack of care. Although there are similarities between Teasdale and the old maid, Teasdale has had love in her life and is therefore healthy. The poem emphasizes the importance of love, suggesting it can physically make people healthier and happier. Knowing she has been in love, Teasdale is glad to realize that she will 'never be' this woman who looks so physically similar to her."
679,"Whatever it is, it must have
A stomach that can digest

Uttering cries that are almost human.","Whatever it is, it must have a stomach that can digestRubber, coal, uranium, moons, poems. It must swim for miles through the desert.Uttering cries that are almost human. Like the shark it contains a shoe. It can digest uranium, coal and uranium.","'American Poetry' by Louis Simpson invests life into poetry and portrays it as a gigantic creature able to devour a great number of subjects. This piece begins with a god-like description of poetry in America. Simpson invests the idea with the ability to digest several topics. These include rubber, coal, uranium, moons, and most importantly, other poems. In the next stanza, the speaker talks about the range of this creature. It has the ability to reach distant regions. Besides, it aptly portrays human aspirations, pains, and hopes."
680,"You tell me I am wrong.
Who are you, who is anybody to tell me I am wrong?
I am not wrong.
In Syracuse, rock left bare by the viciousness of Greek women,
No doubt you have forgotten the pomegranate trees in flower,
Oh so red, and such a lot of them.
Whereas at Venice,
Abhorrent, green, slippery city
Whose Doges were old, and had ancient eyes,
In the dense foliage of the inner garden
Pomegranates like bright green stone,
And barbed, barbed with a crown.
Oh, crown of spiked green metal
Actually growing!
Now, in Tuscany,
Pomegranates to warm your hands at;
And crowns, kingly, generous, tilting crowns
Over the left eyebrow.
And, if you dare, the fissure!
Do you mean to tell me you will see no fissure?
Do you prefer to look on the plain side?
For all that, the setting suns are open.
The end cracks open with the beginning:
Rosy, tender, glittering within the fissure.
Do you mean to tell me there should be no fissure?
No glittering, compact drops of dawn?
Do you mean it is wrong, the gold-filmed skin, integument,
shown ruptured?
For my part, I prefer my heart to be broken.
It is so lovely, dawn-kaleidoscopic within the crack.","You tell me I am wrong. I am not wrong. The end cracks open with the beginning. Rosy, tender, glittering within the fissure. Glittering, compact drops of dawn. The gold-filmed skin, integument, ruptured. I prefer my heart to be broken.","Pomegranate by D. H. Lawrence begins by directly questioning the reader's authority on right and 'wrong'. The start of the poem is strange, Lawrence's use of the direct address seemingly angry and pointed. Considering this is a poem about love, it is only right that Lawrence draws upon further strong emotions, dictating to the reader that he will be telling the story, no one else. How he decides to live his life is up to him, 'I am not wrong'. Lawrence takes us on a journey around three cities, 'Syracuse', 'Venice', and 'Tuscany' in order to compare the differing Pomegranates that he finds in each of the locations. This symbol of the pomegranate can be understood as a metaphor for love, Lawrence connecting the red heart and the deep red color of the pomegranate. The final image of the poem focuses on how Lawrence 'prefer[s] my heart to be broken', as in line with a pomegranate, a fissure allows for one to see 'within the crack'."
681,"When did my childhood go?
Was it the day I ceased to be eleven,
Was it the time I realised that Hell and Heaven,
Could not be found in Geography,
And therefore could not be,

Was it the time I realised that adults were not all they seemed to be,
They talked of love and preached of love,
But did not act so lovingly,

To use whichever way I choose,
Producing thoughts that were not those of other people

When I realised that adults were not all they seemed to be, when I found my mind was really mine. When I found that Hell and Heaven, could not be found in Geography. Was it when I realised my thoughts were my own and mine alone?","Childhood' Markus Natten presents the concept of childhood and he questions about its abrupt departure from his life. 'Childhood' by Markus Natten is a subjective poem. Thus, at the beginning of each stanza Natten constantly asks himself, “When did my childhood go?” He is confused about when he ceased to be a child. As an adult, he feels dejected to think about the loss of innocence in him. Those things which once amused him like the thoughts of “Hell and Heaven”, are now faraway dreams. Everything has changed around him. His parents don't love him in the way they did before. The poet has become egocentric. He only thinks about himself, unlike a child. Presently, he is only left with his musings on childhood. He thinks childhood might have gone to a distant land. At last, he gets his answer after seeing an infant's face. The sight gives him a sense of relief to think that it has gone nowhere."
682,"SAID the Lion to the Lioness - 'When you are amber dust, -
No more a raging fire like the heat of the Sun
(No liking but all lust) -

Remember the rose-prickles of bright paws

Till the fire of that sun the heart and the moon-cold bone are one.'


Said the Skeleton lying upon the sands of Time -
'The great gold planet that is the mourning heat of the Sun
Is greater than all gold, more powerful

More powerful than all dust. Once I was Hercules

Is but a foolish wind.'


Said the Sun to the Moon - 'When you are but a lonely white crone,

Edith Sitwell’s best-known work is the one produced during the Second World War. Most of her work focuses on themes such as mortality, time, consciousness, and love. ‘Heart and Mind’, particularly, explores the passion and its difference from the traditional idea of true love. Moreover, the poem considers physical and spiritual existence to question this idea of love and mortality.

The poem is written in free verse form. It has four stanzas with eight, five, four, and five lines respectively. As a free verse poem, ‘Heart and Mind’ doesn’t have a particular rhyme scheme. Nevertheless, enjambment can be read in the poem, and there is a great use of allegorical figures. The tone of ‘Heart and Mind’ is reflective and it has a surreal and fantastical mood."
683,"to a young child

In this one-stanza work, Hopkins utilizes the reaction of a young girl named Margaret to express a deep-rooted fear that humans carry throughout their lives, expressly that of their own mortality. What seems like a simple account of a girl “grieving” over trees losing their “[l]eaves” as summer months leading into the autumn season is eventually noted to have a much greater meaning. That meaning, as Hopkins notes in the final line of the poem, is that Margaret is “mourn[ing]” the passage of her own life, even though she is not mature enough to grasp the notion."
684,"I went down to the river,
I set down on the bank.
I tried to think but couldn't,
So I jumped in and sank.

I came up twice and cried!

I might've sunk and died.
But it was Cold in that water! It was cold!

There is a consistent pattern with two quatrains being followed by a single line. The singular line, whilst different every time follows a similar pattern. Almost acting in the way you would expect a refrain to act. In each quatrain, the second and fourth lines rhyme with one another. This gives the poem an unexpected and playful feel despite being a bit gloomy in its content. The poem comes across as tongue-in-cheek."
685,"Let America be America again.
Let it be the dream it used to be.
Let it be the pioneer on the plain
Seeking a home where he himself is free.

(America never was America to me.)

Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed—
Let it be that great strong land of love
Where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme
That any man be crushed by one above.

(It never was America to me.)

O, let my land be a land where Liberty
Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath,
But opportunity is real, and life is free,
Equality is in the air we breathe.

(There’s never been equality for me,
Nor freedom in this “homeland of the free.”)

Say, who are you that mumbles in the dark?
And who are you that draws your veil across the stars?

I am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart,
I am the Negro bearing slavery’s scars.
I am the red man driven from the land,
I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek—
And finding only the same old stupid plan
Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak.

I am the young man, full of strength and hope,
Tangled in that ancient endless chain
Of profit, power, gain, of grab the land!
Of grab the gold! Of grab the ways of satisfying need!
Of work the men! Of take the pay!
Of owning everything for one’s own greed!

I am the farmer, bondsman to the soil.
I am the worker sold to the machine.
I am the Negro, servant to you all.
I am the people, humble, hungry, mean—
Hungry yet today despite the dream.
Beaten yet today—O, Pioneers!
I am the man who never got ahead,
The poorest worker bartered through the years.

Yet I’m the one who dreamt our basic dream
In the Old World while still a serf of kings,
Who dreamt a dream so strong, so brave, so true,
That even yet its mighty daring sings
In every brick and stone, in every furrow turned
That’s made America the land it has become.
O, I’m the man who sailed those early seas
In search of what I meant to be my home—
For I’m the one who left dark Ireland’s shore,
And Poland’s plain, and England’s grassy lea,
And torn from Black Africa’s strand I came
To build a “homeland of the free.”

The free?

Who said the free? Not me?
Surely not me? The millions on relief today?
The millions shot down when we strike?
The millions who have nothing for our pay?
For all the dreams we’ve dreamed
And all the songs we’ve sung
And all the hopes we’ve held
And all the flags we’ve hung,
The millions who have nothing for our pay—
Except the dream that’s almost dead today.

O, let America be America again—
The land that never has been yet—
And yet must be—the land where every man is free.
The land that’s mine—the poor man’s, Indian’s, Negro’s, ME—

Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain,
Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain,
Must bring back our mighty dream again.

Sure, call me any ugly name you choose—
The steel of freedom does not stain.
From those who live like leeches on the people’s lives,
We must take back our land again,
America!

O, yes,
I say it plain,
America never was America to me,
And yet I swear this oath—
America will be!

Out of the rack and ruin of our gangster death,
The rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies,
We, the people, must redeem
The land, the mines, the plants, the rivers.

The poem takes the reader through the perspective of those who have been put-upon by a system that is supposed to help them. They are the poor, the immigrants, the African Americans, and the Native Americans. They are any who have sought the American Dream and found it to be nonexistent, at least for them. Through the text, Hughes outlines what it would mean to really have the America that people say exists. It will require taking the country back from the “leeches” who feed on the poor and truly achieving freedom."
686,"1. The Cane Fields
There is a parrot imitating spring
in the palace, its feathers parsley green. Out of the swamp the cane appears
to haunt us, and we cut it down. El General searches for a word; he is all the world there is. Like a parrot imitating spring,
we lie down screaming as rain punches through and we come up green. We cannot speak an R—
out of the swamp, the cane appears
and then the mountain we call in whispers Katalina.
The children gnaw their teeth to arrowheads. There is a parrot imitating spring.
El General has found his word: perejil.
Who says it, lives. He laughs, teeth shining out of the swamp. The cane appears
in our dreams, lashed by wind and streaming. And we lie down. For every drop of blood there is a parrot imitating spring.
Out of the swamp the cane appears.
2. The Palace
The word the general’s chosen is parsley. It is fall, when thoughts turn
to love and death; the general thinks
of his mother, how she died in the fall
and he planted her walking cane at the grave and it flowered, each spring stolidly forming four-star blossoms. The general
pulls on his boots, he stomps to
her room in the palace, the one without curtains, the one with a parrot
in a brass ring. As he paces he wonders Who can I kill today. And for a moment the little knot of screams
is still. The parrot, who has traveled
all the way from Australia in an ivory cage, is, coy as a widow, practising spring. Ever since the morning his mother collapsed in the kitchen while baking skull-shaped candies for the Day of the Dead, the general has hated sweets. He orders pastries brought up for the bird; they arrive
dusted with sugar on a bed of lace. The knot in his throat starts to twitch; he sees his boots the first day in battle splashed with mud and urine
as a soldier falls at his feet amazed—
how stupid he looked!— at the sound
of artillery. I never thought it would sing the soldier said, and died. Now
the general sees the fields of sugar cane, lashed by rain and streaming. He sees his mother’s smile, the teeth gnawed to arrowheads. He hears the Haitians sing without R’s
as they swing the great machetes: Katalina, they sing, Katalina,
mi madle, mi amol en muelte. God knows his mother was no stupid woman; she could roll an R like a queen. Even a parrot can roll an R! In the bare room the bright feathers arch in a parody of greenery, as the last pale crumbs
disappear under the blackened tongue. Someone
calls out his name in a voice
so like his mother’s, a startled tear
splashes the tip of his right boot.
My mother, my love in death.
The general remembers the tiny green sprigs men of his village wore in their capes to honor the birth of a son. He will
order many, this time, to be killed
for a single, beautiful word.","El General searches for a word; he is all the world there is. Like a parrot imitating spring, we lie down screaming as rain punches through and we come up green. We cannot speak an R—out of the swamp, the cane appears and then the mountain we call in whispers Katalina. The word the general’s chosen is parsley.","Parsley' by Rita Dove is a powerful retelling of the mass murder of thousands in the Dominican Republic in 1937. The first part of the poem is told from the perspective of the laborers who, practically enslaved to Trujillo, work in the fields. They are haunted by his image and by the image of the sugarcane growing through the swamp. These workers are controlled, in every way possible, by this incredibly cruel man. In the second half of the poem, the speaker moves into the third person in order to give the reader some insight into Trujillo's mind. His sorrow over the death of his mother is the driving force that inspires him to slaughter all those who could roll their “r's” as she could."
687,"And yet, because thou overcomest so,
Because thou art more noble and like a king,
Thou canst prevail against my fears and fling
Thy purple round me, till my heart shall grow
Too close against thine heart henceforth to know
How it shook when alone. Why, conquering
May prove as lordly and complete a thing
In lifting upward, as in crushing low!
And as a vanquished soldier yields his sword
To one who lifts him from the bloody earth,
Even so, Beloved, I at last record,
Here ends my strife. If thou invite me forth,
I rise above abasement at the word.
Make thy love larger to enlarge my worth.","Because thou art more noble and like a king,                Thou canst prevail against my fears and fling                Thy purple round me, till my heart shall grow                Too close against thine heart henceforth to know                How it shook when alone.

In the first part of the poem, the speaker declares that with her beloved's love, she can overcome anything. She knows that he is going to protect her and help her live a happier life. As the sonnet progresses, the poet states that she is ready to dedicate herself to her newfound happiness and escape the sorrow of her past."
688,"Marrying left your maiden name disused.
Its five light sounds no longer mean your face,
Your voice, and all your variants of grace;
For since you were so thankfully confused

It was of her that these two words were used.

Untruthful? Try whispering it slowly.
No, it means you. Or, since you're past and gone,

It means what we feel now about you then:

So vivid, you might still be there among
Those first few days, unfingermarked again.

Instead of losing shape and meaning less
With your depreciating luggage laden.","Marrying left your maiden name disused. Its five light sounds no longer mean your face, and all your variants of grace.

The poem begins with the speaker addressing the listener as “you.” This person has recently gotten married and cast off their maiden name. Now, they go by something different. With the alteration of their name, they have severed all ties to the past. The person Larkin knew, the young beautiful girl, is gone. All he has left are the memories. In the next lines, Larkin describes how the listener's maiden name is lost to her. Everything she used to own with her old name on it has been discarded. As if acting negligently, she has thrown it all away. The final stanza describes in detail how the speaker takes comfort in her old name. It still exists but now it only represents memories. There, within the past, he is able to commune with the girl he knew before."

This poem begins with a direct address to Averill to whom the poem is dedicated. The speaker of this piece, Young, tells his co-passenger to stop by the fields somewhere outside the limits of Topeka town. He welcomes him to enjoy the rustic scene where a rusted tractor stands by. In an epigrammatic tone, he tells his Averill that the world was never too small. The advanced transportation brought the regions closer. He goes on to share the story of Spanish conquistador Coronado who once stepped on this rich land in search of gold. However, he had a disappointing end but this land does not disappoint the speaker."
690,"About suffering they were never wrong,
The old Masters: how well they understood
Its human position: how it takes place
While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along;
How, when the aged are reverently, passionately waiting
For the miraculous birth, there always must be
Children who did not specially want it to happen, skating
On a pond at the edge of the wood:
They never forgot
That even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course
Anyhow in a corner, some untidy spot
Where the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer's horse
Scratches its innocent behind on a tree.
In Breughel's Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away
Quite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman may
Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry,
But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone
As it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green
Water, and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen
Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,
Had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.","About suffering they were never wrong, the old Masters: how well they understood.

How, when the aged are reverently, passionately waiting for the miraculous birth, there always must be children who did not specially want it to happen.","Musee des Beaux Arts' by W.H. Auden describes, through the use of one specific artwork, the impact of suffering on humankind. The poem begins with the speaker stating that the “Old Masters” who were responsible for the art he was looking at, knew struggle well. Through their paintings, they were able to portray suffering in a way that most people never see it. It goes on in the background while others sit, eat, and go about their normal lives. He continues on to say that suffering can take many forms and even revolve around the same event, such as the birth of a child. In the final lines of the first stanza, the speaker mentions martyrs and how their sacrifice is never properly appreciated. It fades into the background and is overtaken by the mundane world. In the second stanza, he refers directly to a piece of art, Landscape with the Fall of Icarus. In this work, one can observe Icarus falling into the sea in the bottom right-hand corner. In the foreground, there are figures ploughing the land and preparing to sail. No one notices the boy's suffering or if they do, they make no effort to help. Their lives take precedence over another's struggle. "
691,"On another occasion, we get sent out

Since 1914, poets, artists and writers have been trying to document, explain, and to illustrate the war experience for the commoners at home, and for the soldiers who have lived through it; trying to make sure that, in the case of horrific wars such as the First World War, such a conflict is never repeated. Countless attempts have been made to throw light on the idea of loyalty, fealty, and the needlessly bloody sacrifices that soldiers make for queen and country. That being kept in mind, the fact that there are still wars raging today – or, in the case of England, were raging until quite recently – means that there is no shortage of material for poets to draw upon, and that is the subject of Simon Armitage's 'Remains'."
692,"I looked up from my writing,
And gave a start to see,
As if rapt in my inditing,

The poem begins with the speaker sitting at his writing desk, looking up, and being startled by the presence of the moon directly outside his window. He initially believes the moon is there to see what he is writing, but after he asks her what she is doing. Her answer quickly contradicts this assumption. She states that she out looking for the body of a man who killed himself by drowning. The man was overwrought with sorrow over the death of his son, an innocent young man killed in battle. The moon is distraught by this battle and those who willingly participate in it. Continuing on, the moon addresses the speaker once more. She says that she is there at his window because she wants to know what kind of man can spend his time writing when the world is experiencing battles such as this. She believes he is willingly wearing blinders, ignorant of what is truly important. He is deeply upset by this accusation but plays directly into her opinion of him, hiding from her gaze."
693,"Since Christmas they have lived with us,
Guileless and clear,
Oval soul-animals,
Taking up half the space,
Moving and rubbing on the silk

Invisible air drifts,
Giving a shriek and pop
When attacked, then scooting to rest, barely trembling.
Yellow cathead, blue fish————
Such queer moons we live with

Instead of dead furniture!
Straw mats, white walls
And these traveling
Globes of thin air, red, green,
Delighting

The heart like wishes or free
Peacocks blessing
Old ground with a feather
Beaten in starry metals.
Your small

Brother is making
His balloon squeak like a cat.
Seeming to see
A funny pink world he might eat on the other side of it,
He bites,

Then sits
Back, fat jug
Contemplating a world clear as water.
A red
Shred in his little fist.

They give a shriek and pop when attacked, then scooting to rest, barely trembling.","Balloons' is a beautiful rendering of an everyday object as she elevates the balloons' nature by giving them life. It is also one of the best confessional poems as it expresses the vulnerable side of depression. Sylvia sees beauty in ordinary things, but it only lasts for a short while, and she is back to the harsh reality that breaks her heart and removes her happiness. In the end, she explains how one's childhood dreams and innocence is lost as the person grows up and is left with the harsh reality. "

This is an unusual choice as a sonnet is a form most often associated with love poems. The poem is highly comical and full of amusing comparisons and colorful metaphors. It employs several tricolons, a poetic device whereby three adjectives are used in quick succession. Perhaps this repeating pattern of description is supposed to symbolize a heartbeat? One thing is for sure the poem “zips along” at a breakneck pace. The subject matter is a person giving up their organs to the national health service, although as I have asserted I think there are deeper levels to this poem. Whilst I have assigned this poem a title it doesn't actually have one. It is taken from a collection called Book of Matches. In this collection all the poems are supposed to be able to be read in the time it takes for a match to burn to its end."

The poem explores the physical things they see and how they occupy their time while on the train. It turns to an introspective dream state, discussing how strangers are linked through their dreams and can relate to each other as everyone has a problem going on. The final part of the poem turns to these 'problems', presenting the strangers looking inward, always trying to 'solve' something that is bothering them. When the passengers depart, Zapruder suggests that a part of the journey lives on within them forever, never really leaving behind the memory of traveling."
696,"Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road,
Healthy, free, the world before me,
The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose. 

Henceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune,
Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing,
Done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms,
Strong and content I travel the open road.

I do not want the constellations any nearer,
I know they are very well where they are,
I know they suffice for those who belong to them.

The song was written in response to a series of events in the lives of Dylan and his family. Dylan's lyrics include the words: ""I am not afraid of what the future holds for me""","'Song of the Open Road' by Walt Whitman describes a trip the speaker takes in order to learn about himself and enjoy the journey to an unnamed destination. The speaker of the poem is describing a trip on which he is embarking. He describes himself as being “healthy and free,” and he realizes he is the only person who is in complete control of his life; he chooses his own destiny. Because of this realization, he does not have to wish or hope or pray for good fortune. He attests that he, himself, is his own good fortune, and that is all he needs. There is nothing that he is lacking. He will reach his destination on his own, and the earth will provide him with anything extra that is necessary. This is not to say that the road he is taking is not paved with imperfections and burdens. Rather than worry, however, the speaker has decided to take those burdens with him and deal with them as they arise."

The speaker starts the poem by including herself as part of the country. “We are the coffin fillers,” she says. The country is responsible for countless deaths that are treated callously. They occur regularly and in such a way that the government does not appear to care who they impact and why. The poem goes on, describing a child opening a shoebox bomb and a woman washing her mangled heart in the river. These striking and emotional images are contrasted with the lack of regard the speaker sees America showing for the rest of the world. The poem concludes with the speaker asking America where its “credentials” are or what right it has to take the actions its been taking."
698,"Some folks will tell you the blues is a woman,
Some type of supernatural creature.
My mother would tell you, if she could,
About her life with my father,
A strange and sometimes cruel gentleman.
She would tell you about the choices

Is falling in with some man
A deal with the devil
In blue terms, the tongue we use
When we don't want nuance
To get in the way,
When we need to talk straight.

After choosing a man
Who was, as we sing it,
Of no account.
This man made my father look good,
That's how bad it was.
He made my father seem like an island
In the middle of a stormy sea,
He made my father look like a rock.
And is the blues the moment you realize
You exist in a stacked deck,
You look in a mirror at your young face,
The face my sister carries,
And you know it's the only leverage
You've got.
Does this create a hurt that whispers
How you going to do?
Is the blues the moment
You shrug your shoulders
And agree, a girl without money
Is nothing, dust
To be pushed around by any old breeze.
Compared to this,
My father seems, briefly,
To be a fire escape.
This is the way the blues works
Its sorry wonders,
Makes trouble look like
A feather bed,
Makes the wrong man's kisses 
A healing.","Some folks will tell you the blues is a woman, some type of supernatural creature.

The speaker, the woman's son, tells a brief story about his mother's life and the choices she made. He knows that if asked, she'd tell the same one. She's had to make decisions that might seem like the wrong ones, but at the time, they were the only good ones she had. She chose the speaker's father after being with a man of “no account,” someone who made the speaker's cruel father seem like a dependable island. Because of her place in the world and the poverty she faced, she had to take the best possible out she had. He was a fire escape into a slightly better world."
699,"If I leave all for thee, wilt thou exchange
And be all to me? Shall I never miss
Home-talk and blessing and the common kiss

When I look up, to drop on a new range
Of walls and floors ... another home than this?
Nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is
Filled by dead eyes too tender to know change?
That's hardest. If to conquer love, has tried,
To conquer grief, tries more ... as all things prove;
For grief indeed is love and grief beside.
Alas, I have grieved so I am hard to love.
Yet love me—wilt thou? Open thine heart wide,
And fold within, the wet wings of thy dove.","If I leave all for thee, wilt thou exchange all for me? Shall I never miss? ""Grief indeed is love and grief beside.

The poem begins with the speaker asking a few questions about her beloved and expressing her concerns about their future. She's leaving her life behind and hopes that Browning is ready to do the same for her. At the same time, she's amazed that she could've ever thought that she wouldn't miss the elements of her day-to-day life (the things that brought her comfort when she was most sorrowful), but she's willingly leaving them behind."

This poem begins with the imagery of a strong wind. It unsettles the crows sitting on the roof. They cannot hold on to their position for the pressure. Hence they fly away and try to perch on things that come across. In the following lines, Eady likens the crows' flight to an awkward dance. It appears to be a comic incident to the speaker. Besides, their dance also reminds him of the embarrassing situations occurring while one's love goes wrong."

In the first stanza of this poem, the speaker declares that now, he's a man, and, like a tree, he can look back over his life and see the footsteps that led him to where he is now. This is not a process that he found to be rewarding. When analyzing his life, he discovers that he was misled by another person or group. Now, he's been left with a great deal of blood on his hands and the inability to escape from his guilt. There's nothing he can do to get away from the hurt he's feeling or change the life he's been living."
702,"Twelve o'clock.
Along the reaches of the street
Held in a lunar synthesis,
Whispering lunar incantations
Dissolve the floors of memory
And all its clear relations,
Its divisions and precisions,
Every street lamp that I pass
Beats like a fatalistic drum,
And through the spaces of the dark
Midnight shakes the memory
As a madman shakes a dead geranium.

Half-past one,
The street lamp sputtered,
The street lamp muttered,
The street lamp said, 'Regard that woman
Who hesitates towards you in the light of the door
Which opens on her like a grin.
You see the border of her dress
Is torn and stained with sand,
And you see the corner of her eye
Twists like a crooked pin.'

The memory throws up high and dry
A crowd of twisted things;
A twisted branch upon the beach
Eaten smooth, and polished
As if the world gave up
The secret of its skeleton,
Stiff and white.
A broken spring in a factory yard,
Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left
Hard and curled and ready to snap.

Half-past two,
The street lamp said,
'Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,
Slips out its tongue
And devours a morsel of rancid butter.'
So the hand of a child, automatic,
Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay.
I could see nothing behind that child's eye.
I have seen eyes in the street
Trying to peer through lighted shutters,
And a crab one afternoon in a pool,
An old crab with barnacles on his back,
Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.

Half-past three,
The lamp sputtered,
The lamp muttered in the dark.
The lamp hummed:
'Regard the moon,
La lune ne garde aucune rancune,
She winks a feeble eye,
She smiles into corners.
She smoothes the hair of the grass.
The moon has lost her memory.
A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,
Her hand twists a paper rose,
That smells of dust and old Cologne,
She is alone
With all the old nocturnal smells
That cross and cross across her brain.'
The reminiscence comes
Of sunless dry geraniums
And dust in crevices,
Smells of chestnuts in the streets,
And female smells in shuttered rooms,
And cigarettes in corridors
And cocktail smells in bars.

The lamp said,
'Four o'clock,
Here is the number on the door.
Memory!
You have the key,
The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,
Mount.
The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,
Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life.'

A broken spring in a factory yard.Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left. The last twist of the knife.,"Rhapsody on a Windy Night' by T.S. Eliot depicts a desolate and depressing landscape of contemporary life that is enough to drive one mad. The poem begins with the speaker describing a wandering man walking through a dark street. It is midnight, and memories twist and blur. This corrupts one's experience of the world, making it harder to determine what is real and what is not. The wanderer hears the street lamps making noise, and eventually speaking. They tell the speaker to look in a doorway and observe a woman standing there. Her face is twisted, and the scene has a sinister feel. This encounter brings on some of the strange memories that are distorted by life. There is one of a smooth branch on the beach. It represents the bones of the world that have been scrubbed clean of anything living. The next lines speak to a loss of innocence, as seen in the eyes of a child. Then the poem moves on the moon. “She” is a calming presence, due to the fact that she lost her memories. The poem eventually concludes with the speaker returning to his apartment. Everything is there, ready for him to go to bed and get up in the morning and return to the dark and depressing world described in the previous five stanzas. "

It describes Actaeon as being a young hunter who accidentally saw Artemis, or Diana, the goddess of the hunt, naked while she was bathing. He was frozen to the spot, stunned by her beauty and Artemis caught him spying on her. As his punishment, he was told never to speak again or he would be transformed into a deer. The young man was unable to abide by this command and when he heard his pack of hunting dogs he called out to them. This transgression resulted in his transformation. The hounds of Actaeon, of which there were 30-50, were very swift and adept hunters. They did not know their master had been turned into a stag and they hunted him down and brutally tore him to pieces."
705,"Once more the storm is howling, and half hid

Bred on the Atlantic, can be stayed;
And for an hour I have walked and prayed
Because of the great gloom that is in my mind.

Dancing to a frenzied drum,
Out of the murderous innocence of the sea.

May she be granted beauty and yet not
Beauty to make a stranger's eye distraught,
Or hers before a looking-glass, for such,
Being made beautiful overmuch,
Consider beauty a sufficient end,
Lose natural kindness and maybe
The heart-revealing intimacy
That chooses right, and never find a friend.

Helen being chosen found life flat and dull
And later had much trouble from a fool,
While that great Queen, that rose out of the spray,
Being fatherless could have her way
Yet chose a bandy-leggèd smith for man.
It's certain that fine women eat
A crazy salad with their meat
Whereby the Horn of Plenty is undone.

In courtesy I'd have her chiefly learned;
Hearts are not had as a gift but hearts are earned
By those that are not entirely beautiful;
Yet many, that have played the fool
For beauty's very self, has charm made wise,
And many a poor man that has roved,
Loved and thought himself beloved,
From a glad kindness cannot take his eyes.

May she become a flourishing hidden tree
That all her thoughts may like the linnet be,
And have no business but dispensing round
Their magnanimities of sound,
Nor but in merriment begin a chase,
Nor but in merriment a quarrel.
O may she live like some green laurel
Rooted in one dear perpetual place.

My mind, because the minds that I have loved,
The sort of beauty that I have approved,
Prosper but little, has dried up of late,
Yet knows that to be choked with hate
May well be of all evil chances chief.
If there's no hatred in a mind
Assault and battery of the wind
Can never tear the linnet from the leaf.

An intellectual hatred is the worst,
So let her think opinions are accursed.
Have I not seen the loveliest woman born
Out of the mouth of Plenty's horn,
Because of her opinionated mind
Barter that horn and every good
By quiet natures understood
For an old bellows full of angry wind?

Considering that, all hatred driven hence,
The soul recovers radical innocence
And learns at last that it is self-delighting,
Self-appeasing, self-affrighting,
And that its own sweet will is Heaven's will;
She can, though every face should scowl
And every windy quarter howl
Or every bellows burst, be happy still.

And may her bridegroom bring her to a house
Where all's accustomed, ceremonious;
For arrogance and hatred are the wares
Peddled in the thoroughfares.
How but in custom and in ceremony
Are innocence and beauty born?
Ceremony's a name for the rich horn,
And custom for the spreading laurel tree.","Once more the storm is howling, and half hid under this cradle-hood and coverlid, my child sleeps on. There is no obstacle but Gregory's wood and one bare hill, where the haystack- and roof-levelling wind can be stayed. For an hour I have walked and prayed because of the great gloom that is in my mind.","W. B. Yeats, in his ten-stanza poem, ‘A Prayer for my Daughter’, questions how best to raise his daughter. Though by 1919, the war was over, in Ireland, it yet turned normal. So, he ponders how she will survive the difficult times ahead in the politically turbulent times. The poem not only expresses the helplessness of Yeats as a father but all fathers who had to walk through this situation. He wants to give his daughter a life of beauty and innocence, safety, and security. He further wants her to be well-mannered and full of humility, free from intellectual hatred and being strongly opinionated. Finally, he wants her to get married into an aristocratic family which is rooted in spirituality and traditional values."
706,"On a clear day he'd bring him here,
his young son, charging the hill
as wild as the long-maned ponies

who'd watch a moment
before dropping their heads to graze again.
When he finally got him still

he'd crouch so their eyes were level,
one hand on the small of his back
the other tracing the horizon,


pointing out all the places lived in
by the fathers and sons before them:
Tretower, Raglan, Bredwardine ...

'Look. Look over this land and see how long

that will matter
but the depth of their impression;

And that's why he's come back again
to tip these ashes onto the tongues of the wind
and watch them spindrift into the night.

to heal or mend,
but because he knows these walls,

sunk however low,

Several stanzas span their story, focusing on the theme of family and heritage. In stanza 7 a Volta occurs, drawing the poem into the present, watching the father tipping ashes into the fort, watching them slowly drift away from him. The poem focuses on family, grief, and nature’s ability to support. It is tragic and reflects the father’s loss of a son."
707,"This was the land's end: the last fingers, knuckled and rheumatic,
Cramped on nothing. Black
Admonitory cliffs, and the sea exploding
With no bottom, or anything on the other side of it,
Whitened by the faces of the drowned.
Now it is only gloomy, a dump of rocks —-
Leftover soldiers from old, messy wars.
The sea cannons into their ear, but they don't budge.
Other rocks hide their grudges under the water.

The cliffs are edged with trefoils, stars and bells
Such as fingers might embroider, close to death,
Almost too small for the mists to bother with.
The mists are part of the ancient paraphernalia —-
Souls, rolled in the doom-noise of the sea.
They bruise the rocks out of existence, then resurrect them.
They go up without hope, like sighs.
I walk among them, and they stuff my mouth with cotton.
When they free me, I am beaded with tears.

Our Lady of the Shipwrecked is striding toward the horizon,
Her marble skirts blown back in two pink wings.
A marble sailor kneels at her foot distractedly, and at his foot
A peasant woman in black
Is praying to the monument of the sailor praying.
Our Lady of the Shipwrecked is three times life size,
Her lips sweet with divinity.
She does not hear what the sailor or the peasant is saying —-
She is in love with the beautiful formlessness of the sea.

Gull-colored laces flap in the sea drafts
Beside the postcard stalls.
The peasants anchor them with conches. One is told:
""These are the pretty trinkets the sea hides,
Little shells made up into necklaces and toy ladies.
They do not come from the Bay of the Dead down there,
But from another place, tropical and blue,
We have never been to.
These are our crêpes. Eat them before they blow cold.""","This was the land's end: the last fingers, knuckled and rheumatic. Black. cliffs, and the sea exploding.

'Finisterre' by Sylvia Plath is all about the Cape Finisterre and revolves around all the things that are associated with this place. In the first stanza, the poet gives a preliminary description of the edges of the cape and reflects on the sea that devoured several “faces” throughout history. The next stanza talks about the men who “rolled in the doom-noise of the sea”. The poet finds herself among them who “go up without hope, like sighs”. In the third stanza, the poet visualizes a figure of a “Lady of the Shipwrecked”, three times bigger than a normal person. The mysterious lady appears as a guardian spirit of that place. In the last stanza, there is a reference to a peasant woman and a sailor. It seems that they have come there as pilgrims. They offer the poet “crêpes”, a type of pancake at the end of the poem."
708,"The Poplars are fell’d, farewell to the shade
And the whispering sound of the cool colonnade,
The winds play no longer and sing in the leaves,
Nor Ouse on his bosom their image receives.

Twelve years have elapsed since I last took a view
Of my favourite field and the bank where they grew,
And now in the grass behold they are laid,
And the tree is my seat that once lent me a shade.

The black-bird has fled to another retreat
Where the hazels afford him a screen from the heat,
And the scene where his melody charm’d me before,
Resounds with his sweet-flowing ditty no more.

My fugitive years are all hasting away,
And I must e’er long lie as lowly as they,
With a turf on my breast and a stone at my head
E’er another such grove shall arise in its stead.

’Tis a sight to engage me if any thing can
To muse on the perishing pleasures of Man;
Though his life be a dream, his enjoyments, I see,
Have a Being less durable even than he.","Twelve years have elapsed since I last took a view of my favourite field and the bank where they grew.

The poem begins with the speaker describing how the place he loves no longer gives him shade. The trees have been cut down and are now more like seats. Their loss has impacted more than just his own emotions though, the blackbird no longer has anywhere to gain protection from the sun and has been forced to move to a new “scene.” In conclusion, the speaker realizes that the pleasures of life are incredibly short, so much so that they are sure to die out before humankind does. The entire situation has forced the speaker to contend with his own death. Read more of William Cowper's poems."
709,"The whole idea of it makes me feel
like I'm coming down with something,
something worse than any stomach ache
or the headaches I get from reading in bad light--
a kind of measles of the spirit,
a mumps of the psyche,
a disfiguring chicken pox of the soul.

You tell me it is too early to be looking back,
but that is because you have forgotten
the perfect simplicity of being one
and the beautiful complexity introduced by two.
But I can lie on my bed and remember every digit.
At four I was an Arabian wizard.
I could make myself invisible
by drinking a glass of milk a certain way.
At seven I was a soldier, at nine a prince.

But now I am mostly at the window
watching the late afternoon light.
Back then it never fell so solemnly
against the side of my tree house,
and my bicycle never leaned against the garage
as it does today,
all the dark blue speed drained out of it.

This is the beginning of sadness, I say to myself,
as I walk through the universe in my sneakers.
It is time to say good-bye to my imaginary friends,
time to turn the first big number.

It seems only yesterday I used to believe
there was nothing under my skin but light.
If you cut me I could shine.
But now when I fall upon the sidewalks of life,
I skin my knees. I bleed.","The whole idea of looking back makes me feel like I'm coming down with something, he writes. At four I was an Arabian wizard. At seven I was a soldier, at nine a prince.

'On Turning Ten' by Billy Collins is a very melancholy poem. The speaker, a child who is turning ten soon, discusses his feelings on going from being in the single digits to double. He feels as if he has a sickness of his soul when thinking about turning ten, and he realizes the pain and heartache that surely awaits him now that he is mature. An adult to whom the speaker is close, presumably his parent, tells the speaker that he is too young to be so retrospective, that he should enjoy his childhood still. However, the speaker confesses that this is impossible: he now sees the world differently than he once did in his younger years. "
710,"Your mind and you are our Sargasso Sea,
London has swept about you this score years
And bright ships left you this or that in fee:
Ideas, old gossip, oddments of all things,
Strange spars of knowledge and dimmed wares of price.
Great minds have sought you — lacking someone else.
You have been second always. Tragical?
No. You preferred it to the usual thing:
One dull man, dulling and uxorious,
One average mind — with one thought less, each year.
Oh, you are patient, I have seen you sit
Hours, where something might have floated up.
And now you pay one. Yes, you richly pay.
You are a person of some interest, one comes to you
And takes strange gain away:
Trophies fished up; some curious suggestion;
Fact that leads nowhere; and a tale for two,
Pregnant with mandrakes, or with something else
That might prove useful and yet never proves,
That never fits a corner or shows use,
Or finds its hour upon the loom of days:
The tarnished, gaudy, wonderful old work;
Idols and ambergris and rare inlays,
These are your riches, your great store; and yet
For all this sea-hoard of deciduous things,
Strange woods half sodden, and new brighter stuff:
In the slow float of differing light and deep,
No! there is nothing! In the whole and all,
Nothing that's quite your own.
Yet this is you.","Your mind and you are our Sargasso Sea, says the poet. London has swept about you this score years, writes the author. You have been second always, he writes. You are patient, I have seen you sit for hours, where something might have floated up.","Portrait d'une Femme' by Ezra Pound is a clever poem about the history and power, or lack thereof, of the female muse in modern poetry. Throughout the lines of the poem, Pound uses figurative language to create a complex portrait of a woman. This woman is at the heart of all the good and mundane ideas the “great minds” and “bright ships” have asked her for. She is the source of inspiration that many a writer and artist has turned to throughout time when they were at a loss. Despite the fact that she is secondary to a larger, more abstract artistic goal, Pound's speaker doesn't think she minds. She is the Sargasso Sea to writers and artists, everything is attracted to her, and she gives back bits and pieces, some of which come to fruition and others that do not. The poem concludes with the speaker noting that despite all the things she seems to own, and all the things that are given to her, she truly owns nothing. The intangible nature of ideas and concepts means that she is made of other people's work."
711,"A bird that I don't know,
Hunched on his light-pole like a scarecrow,
Looks sideways out into the wheat
The wind waves under the waves of heat.
The field is yellow as egg-bread dough
Except where (just as though they'd let
It live for looks) a locust billows
In leaf-green and shade-violet,
A standing mercy.
The bird calls twice, ""Red clay, red clay"";
Or else he's saying, ""Directly, directly.""
If someone came by I could ask,
Around here all of them must know --
And why they live so and die so --
Or why, for once, the lagging heron
Flaps from the little creek's parched cresses
Across the harsh-grassed, gullied meadow
To the black, rowed evergreens below.
They know and they don't know.
To ask, a man must be a stranger --
And asking, much more answering, is dangerous;
Asked about it, who would not repent
Of all he ever did and never meant,
And think a life and its distresses,
Its random, clutched-for, homefelt blisses,
The circumstances of an accident?
The farthest farmer in a field,
A gaunt plant grown, for seed, by farmers,
Has felt a longing, lorn urbanity
Jailed in his breast; and, just as I,
Has grunted, in his old perplexity,
A standing plea.
From the tar of the blazing square
The eyes shift, in their taciturn
And unavowing, unavailable sorrow.
Yet the intonation of a name confesses
Some secrets that they never meant
To let out to a soul; and what words would not dim
The bowed and weathered heads above the denim
Or the once-too-often washed wash dresses?
They are subdued to their own element.
One day
The red, clay face
Is lowered to the naked clay;
After some words, the body is forsaken
The shadows lengthen, and a dreaming hope
Breathes, from the vague mound, Life;
From the grove under the spire
Stars shine, and a wandering light
Is kindled for the mourner, man.
The angel kneeling with the wreath
Sees, in the moonlight, graves.","A bird that I don't know sits on his light-pole like a scarecrow. He calls twice, ""Red clay, red clay""; or else he's saying, ""Directly, directly"" If someone came by I could ask, around here all of them must know -- and why they live so and die so.","A Country Life' by Randall Jarrell gives a deeply felt depiction of the impacts of life, death, and loneliness on one's life before death finally comes. The poem begins with the speaker noticing a bird he has never seen before. Form these lines he moves to describe the surroundings of the bird. They are in farmland, a place that represents life but just like everywhere else, is plagued with death. He considers asking someone what this bird is doing there but fears the answer. This is something that will be repeated later on as the speaker analyzes humanity's questioning of their own place in the world. The following sections speak on farmers “jailed” in their breasts and “secrets” that should not be “let out” of the soul. In conclusion, the speaker describes how all the questions cease when one dies. One's place beneath the ground, under a “mound” becomes a source for a new life."
712,"Wherever I am, there's always Pooh,
There's always Pooh and Me.
Whatever I do, he wants to do,
""Where are you going today?"" says Pooh:
""Well, that's very odd 'cos I was too.
Let's go together,"" says Pooh, says he.
""Let's go together,"" says Pooh.

""What's twice eleven?"" I said to Pooh.
(""Twice what?"" said Pooh to Me.)
""I think it ought to be twenty-two.""
""Just what I think myself,"" said Pooh.
""It wasn't an easy sum to do,
But that's what it is,"" said Pooh, said he.
""That's what it is,"" said Pooh.

""Let's look for dragons,"" I said to Pooh.
""Yes, let's,"" said Pooh to Me.
We crossed the river and found a few-
""Yes, those are dragons all right,"" said Pooh.
""As soon as I saw their beaks I knew.
That's what they are,"" said Pooh, said he.
""That's what they are,"" said Pooh.

""Let's frighten the dragons,"" I said to Pooh.
""That's right,"" said Pooh to Me.
""I'm not afraid,"" I said to Pooh,
And I held his paw and I shouted ""Shoo!
Silly old dragons!""- and off they flew.

""I wasn't afraid,"" said Pooh, said he,
""I'm never afraid with you.""

So wherever I am, there's always Pooh,
There's always Pooh and Me.
""What would I do?"" I said to Pooh,
""If it wasn't for you,"" and Pooh said: ""True,
It isn't much fun for One, but Two,
Can stick together, says Pooh, says he. ""That's how it is,"" says Pooh.","Wherever I am, there's always Pooh, says Me. Whatever I do, he wants to do, says Pooh. ""Let's look for dragons,"" I said. ""Yes, let's,"" said Pooh to Me. ""I'm never afraid with you,"" he said.","'Us Two' by A. A. Milne is a simple and heartwarming poem in which the speaker and Winnie-the-Pooh have adventures together. From the first lines of the poem, it's clear that the speaker, a young boy, likely Christopher Robin, is bolstered by the presence of Pooh. Together they agree on everything, feel the same emotions, and are prepared for the same adventures. The poem centers around their friendship while also describing their trip to find some dragons (birds) and how they were unafraid when they scared the dragons away."

Auden is a satire on the adult world through the life of an infant. The child is demanding and selfish in fulfilling his needs, yet innocent. The poet hopes that the child would become a better adult as he grows. 'Mundus et Infans' by Auden describes a child. The child is projected as an aggressive and demanding one from its birth. The child, like a ruler, a tyrant demands his mother to provide him with all he requires to satisfy his physical needs. Further, the poet draws a parallel between the child and a Saint. Both of them are innocent and unaware of manipulating. Auden's observations about human nature are woven into the characteristics of the child, through political, historical, psychological, and economic terms. The underlying irony in the poem compares the authorities in the political and religious fields to the child. Similar to the child, they demand the people supplement them with all they demand without shame. The poet and the others with him hope for the child to become a good one, unlike the tyrants."

In the first lines of 'To a Snail,' the speaker begins by loosely describing a snail, how it moves, and its ability to compress its own body. These lines are an extended metaphor, referring to the choices writers make. She discusses her dislike for unnecessary adornments to the written word or the thought that each word flows naturally from the next and should remain that way. The poem concludes with the speaker reminding everyone that they must be the judge of their own works. They have to, as she does, determine which words are the best at getting their message across without unnecessary additions."
715,"O to break loose, like the chinook
salmon jumping and falling back,
nosing up to the impossible
stone and bone-crushing waterfall –
raw-jawed, weak-fleshed there, stopped by ten
steps of the roaring ladder, and then
to clear the top on the last try,
alive enough to spawn and die.
Stop, back off. The salmon breaks
water, and now my body wakes
to feel the unpolluted joy
and criminal leisure of a boy –
no rainbow smashing a dry fly
in the white run is free as I,
here squatting like a dragon on
time's hoard before the day's begun!
Fierce, fireless mind, running downhill.
Look up and see the harbor fill:
business as usual in eclipse
goes down to the sea in ships –
wake of refuse, dacron rope,
bound for Bermuda or Good Hope,
all bright before the morning watch
the wine-dark hulls of yawl and ketch.
I watch a glass of water wet
with a fine fuzz of icy sweat,
silvery colors touched with sky,
serene in their neutrality –
yet if I shift, or change my mood,
I see some object made of wood,
background behind it of brown grain,
to darken it, but not to stain.
O that the spirit could remain
tinged but untarnished by its strain!
Better dressed and stacking birch,
or lost with the Faithful at Church –
anywhere, but somewhere else!
And now the new electric bells,
clearly chiming, ""Faith of our fathers,""
and now the congregation gathers.
O Bible chopped and crucified
in hymns we hear but do not read,
none of the milder subtleties
of grace or art will sweeten these
stiff quatrains shoveled out four-square –
they sing of peace, and preach despair;
yet they gave darkness some control,
and left a loophole for the soul.
When will we see Him face to face?
Each day, He shines through darker glass.
In this small town where everything
is known, I see His vanishing
emblems, His white spire and flag-
pole sticking out above the fog,
like old white china doorknobs, sad,
slight, useless things to calm the mad.
Hammering military splendor,
top-heavy Goliath in full armor –
little redemption in the mass
liquidations of their brass,
elephant and phalanx moving
with the times and still improving,
when that kingdom hit the crash:
a million foreskins stacked like trash ...
Sing softer! But what if a new
diminuendo brings no true
tenderness, only restlessness,
excess, the hunger for success,
sanity or self-deception
fixed and kicked by reckless caution,
while we listen to the bells –
anywhere, but somewhere else!
O to break loose. All life's grandeur
is something with a girl in summer ...
elated as the President
girdled by his establishment
this Sunday morning, free to chaff
his own thoughts with his bear-cuffed staff,
swimming nude, unbuttoned, sick
of his ghost-written rhetoric!
No weekends for the gods now. Wars
flicker, earth licks its open sores,
fresh breakage, fresh promotions, chance
assassinations, no advance.
Only man thinning out his kind
sounds through the Sabbath noon, the blind
swipe of the pruner and his knife
busy about the tree of life ...
Pity the planet, all joy gone
from this sweet volcanic cone;
peace to our children when they fall
in small war on the heels of small
war – until the end of time
to police the earth, a ghost
orbiting forever lost
in our monotonous sublime.","O to break loose, like the chinook. The salmon breakswater, and now my body wakesto feel the unpolluted joy of a boy.

The poem begins with the speaker describing a monumental effort that is rewarded by only death. These thoughts are followed by a downward spiral that starts with memories of boyhood. He remembers when there was no reason to worry about waking up in the morning or what life would bring. The fact that he can recall what that pure emotion felt like makes his current state of being all the harder to contend with. The next sections move through the ways in which the earth has been degraded. The speaker's main problem is with the godless way in which humankind is living. There is a no longer true passion in, or dedication to, worship. The poem concludes with the speaker stating that if things continue the way they are, which he thinks they will, the future generations will suffer. The earth will become a planet aimlessly floating through space with a population that doesn't take the time to consider the bigger questions of life."

The poem begins with the first speaker, a parent, asking their child why their face is so dirty. The next fourteen lines are the child's rhymed and constantly metered response. They go through a variety of fantasies, adventures, probable and improbable reasons why their face is so dirty. These range from exploring dark caves and silver mines to eating blackberries right off the bush. The poem concludes with the child speaker reminding the parent that it doesn't matter what they've been doing, they've been having more fun than the parent."

That's what my grandma used to say
It keeps at bay the Asian Flu'
And both your elbows free from glue.
So say Bazonka every day

Or when the sun is in your eye!
Never say it in the dark

Only say it in the day

Young Tiny Tim took her advice
He said it once, he said it twice
he said it till the day he died
And even after that he tried
To say Bazonka! every day
Just like my grandma used to say.

That every night at half past two
If you'll stand upon your head
And shout Bazonka! from your bed
You'll hear the word as clear as day

It is “Bazonka” and it is responsible for a number of strange happenings. It can cure the flu and keep one's elbows out of glue. At the same time that it helps people, there are instances in which one should refrain from saying it. The speaker goes through these and then moves into the story of Tiny Tim who used the word every day. In the conclusion of the poem, the speaker describes how the folk who live around him support saying the word at 2:30 AM while standing on one's head."
718,"By a route obscure and lonely, Haunted by ill angels only,
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT, On a black throne reigns upright,
I have reached these lands but newly From an ultimate dim Thule—
From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,
Out of SPACE—Out of TIME.
Bottomless vales and boundless floods, And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods, With forms that no man can discover For the tears that drip all over; Mountains toppling evermore Into seas without a shore; Seas that restlessly aspire, Surging, unto skies of fire; Lakes that endlessly outspread Their lone waters—lone and dead,— Their still waters—still and chilly With the snows of the lolling lily.
By the lakes that thus outspread
Their lone waters, lone and dead,—
Their sad waters, sad and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily,—
By the mountains—near the river Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,— By the grey woods,—by the swamp Where the toad and the newt encamp,— By the dismal tarns and pools
Where dwell the Ghouls,— By each spot the most unholy— In each nook most melancholy,— There the traveller meets, aghast, Sheeted Memories of the Past— Shrouded forms that start and sigh As they pass the wanderer by— White-robed forms of friends long given, In agony, to the Earth—and Heaven.
For the heart whose woes are legion ’T is a peaceful, soothing region— For the spirit that walks in shadow ’T is—oh, ’t is an Eldorado!
But the traveller, travelling through it, May not—dare not openly view it; Never its mysteries are exposed To the weak human eye unclosed; So wills its King, who hath forbid The uplifting of the fring'd lid; And thus the sad Soul that here passes Beholds it but through darkened glasses.
By a route obscure and lonely, Haunted by ill angels only,
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
On a black throne reigns upright, I have wandered home but newly From this ultimate dim Thule.","By a route obscure and lonely, Haunted by ill angels only, where an Eidolon, named NIGHT, On a black throne reigns upright, I have reached these lands but newly From an ultimate dim Thule.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he has just entered a new world. It is ruled by a single, kingly spirit but contains many ghouls and dark angels. As the speaker moves through the landscape, nothing is as it should be. The oceans don't have shores and the water rises up to touch the fire-filled sky. He eventually encounters the ghosts of long-dead friends and comes to the conclusion that this place is good for him. He has many woes to contend with and seems to be able to address them here. The poem ends as it began, with an almost perfect repletion of the opening six lines."

The poet reflects over what he has lost, thinking of past relationships in the dark. There is a great sense of loss, Gibbons feeling his memories fade away. The relationship is described as fleeting, nothing more than a 'moment pulse' in his life. The world around the poet continues, a 'snowplow' clearing the roads for tomorrow's activities. It seems that Gibbons cannot come to terms with his break up, focusing again and again on his memories. The melancholic backdrop of 'night' reflects his somber mood, the poet mourning what he has lost."
720,"Abortions will not let you forget.
You remember the children you got that you did not get, The damp small pulps with a little or with no hair, The singers and workers that never handled the air. You will never neglect or beat
Them, or silence or buy with a sweet.
You will never wind up the sucking-thumb
Or scuttle off ghosts that come.
You will never leave them, controlling your luscious sigh, Return for a snack of them, with gobbling mother-eye.
I have heard in the voices of the wind the voices of my dim killed children.
I have contracted. I have eased
My dim dears at the breasts they could never suck.
I have said, Sweets, if I sinned, if I seized
Your luck
And your lives from your unfinished reach,
If I stole your births and your names,
Your straight baby tears and your games,
Your stilted or lovely loves, your tumults, your marriages, aches, and your deaths,
If I poisoned the beginnings of your breaths,
Believe that even in my deliberateness I was not deliberate. Though why should I whine,
Whine that the crime was other than mine?—
Since anyhow you are dead.
Or rather, or instead,
You were never made.
But that too, I am afraid,
Is faulty: oh, what shall I say, how is the truth to be said? You were born, you had body, you died.
It is just that you never giggled or planned or cried.
Believe me, I loved you all.
Believe me, I knew you, though faintly, and I loved, I loved you

Throughout the lines of 'the mother,' the speaker remembers her past experiences and the children that she's now never going to actually “get”. She wonders about the people that they could've grown up into and even speaks directly to them, a technique known as apostrophe. The poem ends with the speaker saying that she “loved” all the children she almost had."
721,"We were very tired, we were very merry—
We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.
It was bare and bright, and smelled like a stable—
But we looked into a fire, we leaned across a table,
We lay on a hill-top underneath the moon;
And the whistles kept blowing, and the dawn came soon.

We were very tired, we were very merry—
We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry;
And you ate an apple, and I ate a pear,
From a dozen of each we had bought somewhere;
And the sky went wan, and the wind came cold,
And the sun rose dripping, a bucketful of gold.

We were very tired, we were very merry,
We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.
We hailed, “Good morrow, mother!” to a shawl-covered head,
And bought a morning paper, which neither of us read;
And she wept, “God bless you!” for the apples and pears,
And we gave her all our money but our subway fares.","We lay on a hill-top underneath the moon, and the whistles kept blowing. We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.

'Recuerdo' means “I remember” as well as referring to “a memory” in Spanish. As with all memories, it is often uncertain how dependable they are. As one reads through this piece they are confronted with ever-expanding details, but there is no statement about how accurate those details really are."
722,"His Grace! impossible! what dead!
Of old age too, and in his bed!
And could that mighty warrior fall?
And so inglorious, after all!
Well, since he’s gone, no matter how,
The last loud trump must wake him now:
And, trust me, as the noise grows stronger,
He’d wish to sleep a little longer.
And could he be indeed so old
As by the newspapers we’re told?
Threescore, I think, is pretty high;
’Twas time in conscience he should die
This world he cumbered long enough;
He burnt his candle to the snuff;
And that’s the reason, some folks think,
He left behind so great a stink.
Behold his funeral appears,
Nor widow’s sighs, nor orphan’s tears,
Wont at such times each heart to pierce,
Attend the progress of his hearse.
But what of that, his friends may say,
He had those honours in his day.
True to his profit and his pride,
He made them weep before he died.
Come hither, all ye empty things,
Ye bubbles raised by breath of kings;
Who float upon the tide of state,
Come hither, and behold your fate.
Let pride be taught by this rebuke,
How very mean a thing’s a Duke;
From all his ill-got honours flung,
Turned to that dirt from whence he sprung.","His Grace! impossible! what dead!ipientOf old age too, and in his bed!                And could that mighty warrior fall?                And so inglorious, after all!                Well, since he’s gone, no matter how, the last loud trump must wake him now.                And, trust me, as the noise grows stronger,                He’d wish to sleep a little longer.","Context and Historical Details Before beginning this piece it is important to know something about the type of Swift's writing. Part of what one should take note of is in the title, this is a “satirical” poem. That means that the text makes use of humour, irony, and exaggeration to criticize someone or something. In this case, considering the rest of the title, it is definitely someone. This someone has died, and the text of the poem is meant to be an “elegy” or brief poetic statement about their life. The person to whom the title refers is John Churchill. He was the first Duke of Marlborough and died in 1722. It is clear from the text that Swift did not see this man as deserving of a genuine elegy. He used the poem to make fun of the man's accomplishments and make his disdain for Churchill known."
723,"How did she fight? She fought well.
How did she light? Ah, she fell.
Why did she fall? God, who knows all,
Only can tell.

Surely would go to her? Nay!
What of her pain! Their's is the gain.
Ever the way.

Will they not help her to rise

What if she dies ?

The poem begins with the first of many questions about the life and tribulations of the unnamed woman, who appears to have been in some kind of battle, either literal or metaphorical. As the stanzas continue, there are fleeting details revealed about the woman who appears to be some kind of savior but has been rejected by those she helped. Ultimately, the woman is not offered help and the poem concludes with the claim that she will have to stand alone, as one suspects she always did."
724,"The heart of a woman goes forth with the dawn,
As a lone bird, soft winging, so restlessly on,
Afar o’er life’s turrets and vales does it roam
In the wake of those echoes the heart calls home.

The heart of a woman falls back with the night,
And enters some alien cage in its plight,
And tries to forget it has dreamed of the stars
While it breaks, breaks, breaks on the sheltering bars.","The heart of a woman goes forth with the dawn, as a lone bird, soft winging, so restlessly on. The heart breaks on the sheltering bars of some alien cage in its plight, and tries to forget it has dreamed of the stars while it breaks.","'The Heart of a Woman' by Georgia Douglas Johnson describes the freedom for which women yearn and the shelters in which they are imprisoned. The poems begins with the speaker describing how at dawn a woman's heart is able to fly forth from her home like a “lone bird.” This is the only way that a woman is able to experience, even for a time, true freedom. A woman's heart, described as a softly flying bird, travels over all the varying landscapes of the world below. She flies over valleys and turrets and travels through all the feelings that call her home. She will return soon enough. In the second stanza, the day has ended and the woman is forced back into the reality of her world. The bird is once more imprisoned in an “alien cage” that is meant to keep it safe. This confinement seems absurd and incomprehensible to the woman who was just living in so much freedom. In the final lines of this piece, the cage in which the woman is trapped is described as being a “shelter.” This “shelter,” meant to keep a woman from falling to any harm, is the structure that harms her the most."
725,"Daybreak: the household slept.
I rose, blessed by the sun.
A horny fiend, I crept
out with my father's gun.
Let him dream of a child
obedient, angel-mind-

old no-sayer, robbed of power
by sleep. I knew my prize
who swooped home at this hour
with day-light riddled eyes
to his place on a high beam
in our old stables, to dream

light's useless time away.
I stood, holding my breath,
in urine-scented hay,
master of life and death,
a wisp-haired judge whose law
would punish beak and claw.

My first shot struck. He swayed,
ruined, beating his only
wing, as I watched, afraid
by the fallen gun, a lonely
child who believed death clean
and final, not this obscene

bundle of stuff that dropped,
and dribbled through the loose straw
tangling in bowels, and hopped
blindly closer. I saw
those eyes that did not see
mirror my cruelty

while the wrecked thing that could
not bear the light nor hide
hobbled in its own blood.
My father reached my side,
gave me the fallen gun.
'End what you have begun.'

I fired. The blank eyes shone
once into mine, and slept.
I leaned my head upon
my father's arm, and wept,
owl blind in early sun
for what I had begun","Daybreak: the household slept. I rose, blessed by the sun. I crept out with my father's gun. Let him dream of a childipientobedient, angel-mind-mind, robbed of power by sleep.

This narrative poem begins with the speaker describing how one morning when the family was asleep, they stole their father's gun and snuck outside. They admit that they aren't the best-behaved child but are happy to have their family think they are. The speaker goes to the old stables with the intention of killing a barn owl. The speaker describes how the owl sleeps uselessly through the day and how they felt the power of life and death as they moved through the barn. The first shot hit the bird but didn't kill it. It bled all over the ground, and the speaker looked into the owl's eyes and saw their own mirrored back. The father appears in the final lines of the poems and tells the speaker that now they have to finish what they started, despite the fact that they seem to be regretting their choice by this point. The speaker fires the gun again, and the owl dies. The young speaker cried in their father's arms and mourned the loss of the owl. It took seeing death up close and knowing that the owl had a life and mind of its own to fully appreciate what it means to take life."
726,"Today we honor our three captains
For their actions and impact in
A time of uncertainty and need.
They’ve taken the lead,
Exceeding all expectations and limitations
Uplifting their communities and neighbors
As leaders, healers, and educators.

James has felt the wounds of warfare,
But this warrior still shares
His home with at-risk kids.
During Covid, he’s event lent a hand,
Live-streaming football for family and fans.

Trimaine is an educator who works nonstop,
Providing his community with hotspots,
Laptops, and tech workshops,
So his students have all the tools
They need to succeed in life and school.

Suzie is the ICU nurse manager at a Tampa Hospital.
Her chronicles prove that even in tragedy, hope is possible.
She lost her grandmothers to the pandemic,
And fights to save other lives in the ICU battle zone,
Defining the frontline heroes risking their lives for our own.

Let us walk with these warriors,
Charge on with these champions,
And carry forth the call of our captains!
We celebrate them by acting
With courage and compassion,
By doing what is right and just.
For while we honor them today,
It is them who every day honor us","Today we honor our three captains. For their actions and impact in a time of uncertainty and need.

Throughout 'Chorus of the Captains,' the speaker, Gorman herself, describes three heroes Suzie Dorner, James Martin, and Trimaine Davis, who have worked in different ways to benefit their communities. She also alludes to the broader state of the country and the ways that “we” all have to come together to honor the work of those who have lost their lives and those, like the three honorary captains, who continue to work to better the lives of others. The poet is hoping to rekindle hope in the hearts of those reading the poem or listening to its recorded premiere at the start of Super Bowl 52."
727,"I’m very ugly

So don’t try to convince me that

I am a very beautiful person

Because at the end of the day

I hate myself in every single way

And I’m not going to lie to myself by saying

There is beauty inside of me that matters

That I am a worthless, terrible person

And nothing you say will make me believe

If read from top to bottom, this piece expresses a speaker's belief that they are too ugly to find love or happiness. They don't believe that any beauty inside of them is worth anything. If read from bottom to top, the exact opposite is true. The speaker knows they are beautiful, and no one can tell them anything different."
728,"Am I a stone, and not a sheep,

This book included prehistoric Latin devotional poems and hymns in addition to more modern verses. Right after this first publication, Rossetti combined the poem, The Good Friday in her 2nd volume of poetry, which is known as The Prince’s Progress and Other Poems in 1866. Good Friday is a devotional poem. From a literary point of view, the word ‘devotional’ means writing that could augment the religious life or faith of a person. Rossetti, through her pen, had composed a large number of poems based on devotional themes. In these poems, the poet composed prayer poems to express her intimate bond with God and to boost her readers so that they can live a devotional and God-worshipping life. All of Rossetti’s devotional poems orbit around the prophecies, warnings, and promises that you find in the Bible."

And spill their nectar in each drop of dew—

Bearing many a mile the marks of their adventure,

He can tell by the sight of the “Roman wormwood,” also known as, he says, “Ambrosia elatior.” It is the immortal food of the Greek gods. The plants have sprinkled their “yellow dust over” the speaker's shoes and he tracks it back into his house. In the next section, the speaker describes his shoes on the floor in front of him. They are covered in yellow dust as well as evidence of moving through the countryside. This train of thought leads him to a meditation on the lives of those who never venture into the country. He dislikes this way of living and believes the men and women are punished by missing out on the experiences he has."
730,"Aftear night’s thunder far away had rolled
The fiery day had a kernel sweet of cold,
And in the perfect blue the clouds uncurled,
Like the first gods before they made the world
And misery, swimming the stormless sea
In beauty and in divine gaiety.
The smooth white empty road was lightly strewn
With leaves—the holly’s Autumn falls in June—
And fir cones standing stiff up in the heat.
The mill-foot water tumbled white and lit
With tossing crystals, happier than any crowd
Of children pouring out of school aloud.
And in the little thickets where a sleeper
For ever might lie lost, the nettle-creeper
And garden warbler sang unceasingly;
While over them shrill shrieked in his fierce glee
The swift with wings and tail as sharp and narrow
As if the bow had flown off with the arrow.
Only the scent of woodbine and hay new-mown
Travelled the road. In the field sloping down,
Park-like, to where its willows showed the brook,
Haymakers rested. The tosser lay forsook
Out in the sun; and the long waggon stood
Without its team, it seemed it never would
Move from the shadow of that single yew.
The team, as still, until their task was due,
Beside the labourers enjoyed the shade
That three squat oaks mid-field together made
Upon a circle of grass and weed uncut,
And on the hollow, once a chalk-pit, but
Now brimmed with nut and elder-flower so clean.
The men leaned on their rakes, about to begin,
But still. And all were silent. All was old,
This morning time, with a great age untold,
Older than Clare and Cobbett, Morland and Crome,
Than, at the field’s far edge, the farmer’s home,
A white house crouched at the foot of a great tree.
Under the heavens that know not what years be
The men, the beasts, the trees, the implements
Uttered even what they will in times far hence—
All of us gone out of the reach of change—
Immortal in a picture of an old grange.","Aftear night’s thunder far away had rolled in, and the fiery day had a kernel sweet of cold.

The poem begins with the speaker describing the end of a storm and the warmth that comes afterward. The scene is quite tranquil, highlighted by the fallen leaves on the road. Everything appears as it would've when the gods first created it. The speaker continues to discuss the water mill and the birds singing in the woods. These elements are different parts of the same landscape and interact with one another in interesting ways. The poem concludes with a description of the haymakers and the rest they took by the water and how that moment is at once temporary and immortal."
731,"Now we ought to praise the Guardian of the heavenly kingdom,

God created both heaven and earth, he concludes, and that's something that tone has to b thankful for."
732,"Trochee trips from long to short;
From long to long in solemn sort
Slow Spondee stalks, strong foot!, yet ill able
Ever to come up with Dactyl's trisyllable.
Iambics march from short to long.

One syllable long, with one short at each side,
Amphibrachys hastes with a stately stride —
First and last being long, middle short, Amphimacer

And delight in the things of earth, water, and skies;

The poet must win him the love of his father on earth and his father above.","'Metrical Feet' by S. T. Coleridge is a poem that defines different kinds of metrical feet in layman's terms. In the first stanza of the poem, Coleridge talks about several metrical feet such as trochee, spondee, dactyl, iamb, anapest, amphibrach, and amphimacer. The poet uses layman's terms to discuss those meters. As an example, the definition of trochee, according to the poet, is, “Trochee trips from long to short.” Thereafter, in the second stanza, the poet advises his son, Derwent to be “innocent, steady, and wise.” Additionally, if he is close to nature he can be a great poet in the future. At last, Coleridge says, no matter what he will always remain his true admirer and love him."
733,"What's that fluttering in the breeze?
It's just a piece of cloth
that brings a nation to its knees.

What's that unfurling from a pole?
It's just a piece of cloth
That makes the guts of men grow bold.

What's that rising over the tent?
It's just a piece of cloth
that dares the coward to relent.


What's that flying across a field?
It's just a piece of cloth
that will outlive the blood you bleed.

How can I possess such a cloth?
Just ask for a flag my friend.
Then blind your conscience to the end.",What's that fluttering in the breeze? It's just a piece of cloth. That brings a nation to its knees. That makes the guts of men grow bold. That will outlive the blood you bleed. Just ask for a flag my friend. Then blind your conscience to the end.,"For John Agard, the national flag is an especially vague symbol. His poem, ‘Flag’, is an indication of the great many different ways different people can view the same national symbolism. Most people are fairly familiar with their own national flag — for some it is an indication of pride, for some a sign of home, for others, a nostalgic memory. For others, the flag of a foreign country might represent whatever they think of when they consider that country. A number of these interpretations are explored in this poem, and the flag is given a great many dimensions to explore and represent.

Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of symbolism is that particular images and symbols don’t have set meanings, but are interpreted by the viewer in ways that are dependant on that viewer. Take a musical note, for instance — there’s absolutely nothing about those little drawn sticks that has anything to do with musical notes in a literal sense, but to most who view them, that is what they indicate. Those especially familiar with them can pinpoint exactly which note they refer to as well. For others, musical notes are a representation of a foreign language, one that they’ve never been able to establish familiarity with."
734,"I do not love thee!—no! I do not love thee!
And yet when thou art absent I am sad;
And envy even the bright blue sky above thee,
Whose quiet stars may see thee and be glad.
I do not love thee!—yet, I know not why,
Whate’er thou dost seems still well done, to me:
And often in my solitude I sigh
That those I do love are not more like thee!
I do not love thee!—yet, when thou art gone,
I hate the sound (though those who speak be dear)
Which breaks the lingering echo of the tone
Thy voice of music leaves upon my ear.
I do not love thee!—yet thy speaking eyes,
With their deep, bright, and most expressive blue,
Between me and the midnight heaven arise,
Oftener than any eyes I ever knew.
I know I do not love thee! yet, alas!
Others will scarcely trust my candid heart;
And oft I catch them smiling as they pass,
Because they see me gazing where thou art.","I do not love thee!—no! I do notLove thee! yet, alas! others will scarcely trust my candid heart. I envy even the bright blue sky above thee. I hate the sound (though those who speak be dear) which breaks the lingering echo of the tone of music.","'I Do Not Love Thee' by Caroline Elizabeth Sarah Norton is made up of a speaker's professed lack of love for the listener and the evidence very much to the contrary. The poem begins with the speaker stating that she does not love “you,” the listener. This statement which is utilized in all the stanzas, is followed by a number of features of her life which bother her. Firstly, she is sad when this person is not around. This is an emotion she is uncomfortable with. She is so sad that she becomes jealous of the stars who are able to look down on him. Additionally, the speaker is entranced by the listener's deep blue eyes, the way he can do no wrong, and the sound of his voice. All these factors lead a reader to mistrust the speaker. She is confessing her love by attempting to prove she is not in love."
735,"It is never easy

Walking with an invisible border

Separating my left and right foot

I feel like an illegitimate child

Forsaken by my parents

At least I can claim innocence

Since I did not ask to come

Into this world

 

Walking on both sides of this

Invisible border

Each and every day

And for the rest of my life

Is like having been

Sentenced to a torture chamber

Without having committed a crime

 

Understanding the history of humanity

I am not the least surprised

This is happening to me

A non-entity

During this population explosion

In a minuscule world

 

I did not ask to be born an Inuk

Nor did I ask to be forced

To learn an alien culture

With an alien language

But I lucked out on fate

Which I am unable to do

 

I have resorted to fancy dancing

In order to survive each day

No wonder I have earned

The dubious reputation of being

The world’s premier choreographer

Of distinctive dance steps

That allow me to avoid

Potential personal paranoia

On both sides of this invisible border

 

Sometimes this border becomes so wide

That I am unable to take another step

My feet being too far apart

When my crotch begins to tear apart

I am forced to invent

A brand new dance step

The premier choreographer

Saving the day once more

 

Destiny acted itself out

Deciding for me where I would come from

And what I would become

 

So I am left to fend for myself

Walking in two different worlds

Trying my best to make sense

Of two opposing cultures

Which are unable to integrate

Lest they swallow one another whole

 

Each and every day

Is a fighting day

A war of raw nerves

And to show for my efforts

I have a fair share of wins and losses

When will all this end

This senseless battle

Between my left and right foot

 

When will the invisible border

Cease to be",It is never easy walking with an invisible border. I feel like an illegitimate child. I have resorted to fancy dancing in order to survive each day. I am not the least surprised that this is happening to me. I did not ask to be born an Inuk or learn an alien culture.,"Walking Both Sides of an Invisible Border' by Alootook Ipellie depicts the inner thoughts of a speaker who is torn between two different worlds. In the first lines of this piece the speaker, who is very likely the poet himself, states that his life is never easy. He has to walk an invisible border, one foot on each side, every day. These two sides represent the way he was born, Inuk, and how he was forcibly raised in a Western education system. He knows that the way he is forced to live isn't his fault, but that doesn't make it easier. He feels as though destiny decided his life for him, and then left him to struggle through it and fend for himself. In the last stanzas, the speaker compares the dance he does from one side of his mind to the other to a battle. He is frustrated with living this way and longs for the border to “Cease to be”."
736,"High on a bright and sunny bed
A scarlet poppy grew
And up it held its staring head,
And thrust it full in view.
Yet no attention did it win,
By all these efforts made,
And less unwelcome had it been
In some retired shade.
Although within its scarlet breast
No sweet perfume was found,
It seemed to think itself the best
Of all the flowers round,
From this I may a hint obtain
And take great care indeed,
Lest I appear as pert and vain
As does this gaudy weed.","High on a bright and sunny bed                A scarlet poppy grew                And up it held its staring head,                And thrust it full in view.                Although within its scarlet breast                No sweet perfume was found,                It seemed to think itself the best                Of all the flowers round.                From this I may a hint obtain a hint of what to expect in the future.","'The Poppy' by Jane Taylor describes a single, vain poppy flower boldly growing in the sunlight of a field and the speaker's distaste for its display. The poem begins with the speaker coming upon a “scarlet poppy” growing with abounding self-confidence in a prime spot on a hillside. The speaker is taken aback by this sight and surprised that such a flower would display itself so prominently. It is not clear at first why she feels this way, regarding what many agree is a beautiful flower. As the poem progresses her reasoning becomes clear. She states that the poppy would have been much more welcome in this “bed” if it had found somewhere less prominent to “thrust” it's “staring head.” She suggests a place in the shade, out of her direct view. The speaker continues on to state that it is due to the flower's lack of smell that she feels so disdainfully about its location and actions. She imbues the flower with the human ability to decide where it wants to grow and how it wants to look. This is a direct reference to how she, as a woman, would like to act and be seen. The speaker does not want to ever become as vain or “gaudy” as the poppy is and professes her determination to use the lesson of the poppy to maintain her moral strength."
737,"Thou whose spell can raise the dead,
Bid the prophet's form appear.

Light changed its hue, retiring from his shroud.
Death stood all glassy in the fixed eye:

His foot, in bony whiteness, glitterd there,
Shrunken and sinewless, and ghastly bare;

The poem begins with Saul asking that Samuel be brought forth and made to answer his questions about his future. This is done, and Samuel returns in a deteriorated and horrifying state. Saul is shocked into silence by this fact. Samuel declares that Saul and his sons will soon join him in the afterlife. He has only one more day to live and then will become a part of the earth as Samuel is."

This poem takes place within the hospital, us exploring Dent's experience with living with HIV. There is a delicate balance of supportive love and worry within the poem, the lovers having to be careful as to not disconnect the I.V. catheter while hugging. The poem begins and ends with the same image, focusing completely on being within 'your arms', the beauty of human connection being the central focus of us. The certainty of death is present within the poem, but that does not stop Dent from enjoying the moment, being present, and happy within her lover's arms."

It is important to note that it is not simply the trees that he misses, but the whole scene of which they were part, where water, air, and earth collided, to create a thing of wonder. Through the poem ‘Binsey Poplars’, he seems to work through the emotions of grief and sadness, anger, and finally wistfulness that this quietly glorious sight will never be available to future generations."
740,"Late lies the wintry sun a-bed, A frosty, fiery sleepy-head; Blinks but an hour or two; and then, A blood-red orange, sets again. Before the stars have left the skies,

Or with a reindeer-sled, explore The colder countries round the door. When to go out, my nurse doth wrap Me in my comforter and cap; The cold wind burns my face, and blows
Its frosty pepper up my nose.

It uses a variety of interesting images to depict the cold and snow. The poem starts off with the speaker describing how the sun spends far too few hours awake during the winter. It rises, is warm for an hour or two, and then sets again. He uses personification in order to depict this occurrence, and others, within the confines of the poem. The speaker describes how hard it is to get up during this time of year and the way that a single candle does nothing to warm him. When he goes outside, his nurse wraps him up in numerous pieces of clothing, and he can observe the snow-covered landscape. The poem ends with a simile comparing these sights to a frosted wedding cake."

They have been fighting for an extended period of time and the woman has had enough. Throughout the following lines, she compares their situation to that of Adam and Eve. They are on the verge of also losing their Eden. The poem concludes with the wife asking her husband to be a “god” and hold her. She wants them to draw close, ignore their more spiteful natures and sleep."

tracing the route of his trusty urine.

And all that is sweetest and saddest blends

It brings to her memories of walking through the streets, listening to bands play, and being in love. Her emotions range from utter joy to pain and strife while recalling these times.

745,"But, when time pulls lives apart
Hold your own
When everything is fluid, nothing can be known with any certainty

Hold it till you feel it there
As dark and dense and wet as earth
As vast and bright and sweet as air
When all there is is knowing that you feel what you are feeling
Hold your own
Ask your hands to know the things they hold
I know, the days are reeling past in such squealing blasts
But stop for breath and you will know it's yours
Swaying like an open door when storms are coming
Hold
Time is an onslaught, love is a mission
We work for vocations until, in remission
We wish we'd had patience and given more time to our children
Feel each decision that you make
Make it, hold it
Hold your own
Hold your lovers
Hold their hands
Hold their breasts in your hands like your hands were their bra
Hold their face in your palms like a prayer
Hold them all night, feel them hold back
Don't hold back
Hold your own
Every pain
Every grievance
Every stab of shame
Every day spent with a demon in your brain giving chase
Hold it
Know the wolves that hunt you
In time, they will be the dogs that bring your slippers
Love them right and you will feel them kiss you when they come to bite
Hot snouts digging out your cuddles with their bloody muzzles
Hold
Nothing you can buy will ever make you more whole
This whole thing thrives on us feeling always incomplete
And it is why we will search for happiness in whatever thing it is we crave in the moment
And it is why we can never really find it there
It is why you will sit there with the lover that you fought for
In the car you sweated years to buy
Wearing the ring you dreamed of all your life
And some part of you will still be unsure that this is what you really want
Stop craving
Hold your own
But if you're satisfied with where you're at, with who you are
You won't need to buy new make-up or new outfits or new pots and pans
To cook new exciting recipes for new exciting people
To make yourself feel like the new exciting person you think you're supposed to be
Happiness, the brand, is not happiness
We are smarter than they think we are
They take us all for idiots, but that's their problem
When we behave like idiots, it becomes our problem
So, hold your own
Breathe deep on a freezing beach
Taste the salt of friendship
Notice the movement of a stranger
Hold your own
And let it be
Catching

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker acknowledges that life gets hard. When it does, one needs to focus on their immediate moment and what they can touch and change. This will make life easier to deal with than worrying about every eventuality would. The poet's speaker also emphasizes the importance of love and happiness in one's life. These things are the true purpose of life rather than the acquisition of material wealth. Listen to Kae reciting 'Hold Your Own' at Glastonbury here."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that all mothers are lovely and pitiful. They live hard, brave, and troubled lives that stay with their children. This is due to their graciousness in life and death. They (at least the good ones) give everything. The speaker uses the next lines to connect the experiences of those still living with those of the long dead. Her memories tell her that “we,” referring to the offspring of these dead mothers, did as their mothers did. They all worked hard, learned to live in their circumstances, were patient, and maintained hope in the face of fear. The poem concludes with the speaker wondering whether or not the mothers in Paradise can see their children below. Then, if they can, what do they think about the lives they are leading? Do they cry happy tears? Can her own mother bear to look at her?"

Within the first lines of this poem, Jeffers begins by describing powerful images of the natural world, many of which present dangers to the human race. He alludes to the strengths and weaknesses of humanity and inspires readers to explore images of survival, especially in the face of such dangers as the “gale in April” that he observed can present. In the last part of the poem, the speaker turns their intentions towards the refuge that death can provide. It is an escape from the joys, passions, powers, dangers, and horrors of physical life on earth."

But as a strong man, erect, clothed in blue clothes, advancing,
carrying a rifle on your shoulder,
With well-gristled body and sunburnt face and hands—with a knife in
the belt at your side,
As I heard you shouting loud—your sonorous voice ringing across the
continent;
Your masculine voice, O year, as rising amid the great cities,
Amid the men of Manhattan I saw you, as one of the workmen, the
dwellers in Manhattan;
Or with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and
Indiana,
Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait, and descending the
Alleghanies; Or down from the great lakes, or in Pennsylvania, or on deck along
the Ohio river;
Or southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers, or at
Chattanooga on the mountain top,
Saw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limbs, clothed in blue, bearing
weapons, robust year;
Heard your determin'd voice, launch'd forth again and again;
Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the round-lipp'd cannon,
I repeat you, hurrying, crashing, sad, distracted year.","Arm'd year! year of the struggle! No dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you, terrible year!

But as a strong man, erect, clothed in blue clothes, advancing, carrying a rifle.","'1861' by Walt Whitman is a moving poem about a specific year during the American Civil War from the perspective of a soldier. The poem starts with the soldier saying that the year is not one that one writes happy verses about. Instead, it was a terrible experience for everyone. He personifies the year, referring to it as he mentions various locations around the country. In this way, he's able to connect his experience to the year that the rest of the country saw/experienced."
749,"Evening is here, and I am here
At my baize table with a glass,
Now sipping my unfizzy beer,
Now looking out where on the grass

Two striped and crested hoopoes glean
Delicious insects one by one.
A barbet flies into the scene
Across the smoky city sun.

My friends have left, and I can see
No one, and no one will appear.
This must be happiness, to be
Sitting alone with birds and beer.

In a brief while the sun will go,
And grand unnerving bats will fly
Westward in clumped formations, slow
And dark across a darkened sky.","Evening is here, and I am here with a glass, sipping my unfizzy beer. Two striped and crested hoopoes glean insects one by one. I can see no one, and no one will appear. This must be happiness, to be sitting with birds and beer.","'Evening Scene From My Table' by Vikram Seth is a calm, meditative poem that speaks on the beauty and pleasure to be found in time spent alone. The speaker in this piece is by himself at a table drinking “unfizzy beer”. He looks out from where he's sitting and takes note of the creatures going about their lives around him. No one and nothing interacts with him, and he is left to observe and find solace in the “birds and beer”. The poem concludes with a gentled reminder that soon the sun will go away and the “unnerving,” yet “grand,” bats will fly in dark formations “across a darkened sky.”"
750,"Yea, the coneys are scared by the thud of hoofs,
And their white scuts flash at their vanishing heels,
And swallows abandon the hamlet-roofs.The mole’s tunnelled chambers are crushed by wheels,
The lark’s eggs scattered, their owners fled;
And the hedgehog’s household the sapper unseals.The snail draws in at the terrible tread,
But in vain; he is crushed by the felloe-rim.
The worm asks what can be overhead,And wriggles deep from a scene so grim,
And guesses him safe; for he does not know
What a foul red flood will be soaking him!Beaten about by the heel and toe
Are butterflies, sick of the day’s long rheum,
To die of a worse than the weather-foe.Trodden and bruised to a miry tomb
Are ears that have greened but will never be gold,
And flowers in the bud that will never bloom.","Yea, the coneys are scared by the thud of hoofs. The worm asks what can be overhead,And wriggles deep from a scene so grim. Beaten about by the heel and toe are butterflies, sick of the day’s long rheum.

This poem depicts the scene of a battle. It is none other than the Battle of Waterloo of 1815. However, this poem does not deal with what humans think about the war. Rather it is about the creatures such as rabbits, moles, swallows, larks, etc. Throughout this piece, the poet captures the progress of the warhorses on the field. As an effect, those little creatures get affected. Lastly, the poet creates a horrid atmosphere through the portrayal of the suffering of the creatures. His main idea is everything is not going to be normal again after that war."
751,"Families when a child is born
Hope it will turn out intelligent.

Having wrecked my whole life,
Only hope that the baby will prove
Ignorant and stupid.

And grow into a cabinet minister.","Families when a child is born                Hope it will turn out intelligent.                I, through intelligence                Having wrecked my whole life,                Only hope that the baby will prove                Ignorant and stupid.                Then he'll be happy all his days                And grow into a cabinet minister.","On The Birth of a Son by Su Tung-Po begins by discussing how when a 'child is born', the families hope that they are 'intelligent'. However, the poet describes how his life has been wrecked by his own intelligence, living an unhappier life than someone who was born 'stupid'. He wishes stupidity on newborns, allowing them to pass over the sad life path that he has followed. The final line of the poem is a political joke, suggesting that 'cabinet ministers' and politicians, in general, are stupid, lacking all 'intelligence'. Although published almost 1000 years ago, I believe a lot of modern audiences would agree with this final line."
752,"This morning as I walked along the lake shore, 
I fell in love with a wren 
and later in the day with a mouse 
the cat had dropped under the dining room table.

In the shadows of an autumn evening,
I fell for a seamstress
still at her machine in the tailor's window, 
and later for a bowl of broth, 
steam rising like smoke from a naval battle.

This is the best kind of love, I thought, 
without recompense, without gifts, 
or unkind words, without suspicion, 
or silence on the telephone.

The love of the chestnut,
the jazz cap and one hand on the wheel.

No lust, no slam of the door-
the love of the miniature orange tree,
the clean white shirt, the hot evening shower,
the highway that cuts across Florida. 

No waiting, no huffiness, or rancor- 
just a twinge every now and then

for the wren who had built her nest 
on a low branch overhanging the water 
and for the dead mouse, 
still dressed in its light brown suit.

But my heart is always standing on its tripod, 
ready for the next arrow.

After I carried the mouse by the tail
to a pile of leaves in the woods,
I found myself standing at the bathroom sink
gazing down affectionately at the soap,

so patient and soluble
so at home in its pale green soap dish.
I could feel myself falling again
as I felt its turning in my wet hands 
and caught the scent of lavender and stone.","This morning as I walked along the lake shore, I fell in love with a wren and later in the day with a mouse the cat had dropped under the dining room table.

He shifts between different memories, recalling his love for a hardworking seamstress he saw through a window, a bowl of broth, a clean white shirt, and even a Florida highway, although the most enduring image is that of a dead mouse. Throughout his recollections, the speaker compares his love for ordinary things with the problems that plague human romance, including lust and cruelty. As he meditates on how he carefully disposed of the mouse, the speaker subtly suggests that part of the beauty of life is its fragility, something that people often forget in their relationships with each other.

753,"About my husband, the clown,

what could I say?

On stage, he’s a different person.

Up there he’s a king on a throne,

but at home you should hear him moan.

The moment he walks through that door

without that red nose and them funny clothes,

he seems to have the world on his shoulder.

I do me best to cheer him up, poor soul.

I juggle with eggs, I turn cartwheels,

I tell jokes, I do me latest card trick,

I even have a borrow of his red nose.

But he doesn’t say exactly how he feels,

doesn’t say what’s bothering him inside.

Just sits there saying almost to himself:

‘O life, ah life,

In the poem, the wife speaks of her clown husband. She shows the duality between his professional life and his personal life. However, she also tells us about herself. She is not just a passive observer relating information about her husband. No, she is an active participant in the story being told. The wife acts to cheer up her clown husband, taking on the role of a clown herself. So, there is an element of role reversal at play here."
754,"I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless;
That only men incredulous of despair,
Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air
Beat upward to God’s throne in loud access
Of shrieking and reproach. Full desertness,
In souls as countries, lieth silent-bare
Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare
Of the absolute heavens. Deep-hearted man, express
Grief for thy dead in silence like to death—
Most like a monumental statue set
In everlasting watch and moveless woe
Till itself crumble to the dust beneath.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that those who throw up their arms and wail do not truly grieve. They are without the ability to feel true despair. Rather, it is those who express no passion who are truly hurting. She counts herself among them. The speaker goes on to describe how in grief one's soul becomes like a desert and their body like a statue. There is nothing to remove them from this state. in fact, it gets worse every day as the sun (their troubles) beats down on them. In conclusion, she tells the reader that only when one can “weep” will their grief be relieved."

756,"There passed a weary time. Each throat
Was parched, and glazed each eye.
A weary time! a weary time!
How glazed each weary eye,

When looking westward, I beheld
A something in the sky.

At first it seemed a little speck,
And then it seemed a mist;
It moved and moved, and took at last
A certain shape, I wist.

A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!
And still it neared and neared:
As if it dodged a water-sprite,
It plunged and tacked and veered.

With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,
We could nor laugh nor wail;
Through utter drought all dumb we stood!
I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,
And cried, A sail! a sail!

With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,
Agape they heard me call:
Gramercy! they for joy did grin,
And all at once their breath drew in.
As they were drinking all.

See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!
Hither to work us weal;
Without a breeze, without a tide,
She steadies with upright keel!

The western wave was all a-flame.
The day was well nigh done!
Almost upon the western wave
Rested the broad bright Sun;
When that strange shape drove suddenly
Betwixt us and the Sun.

And straight the Sun was flecked with bars,
(Heaven's Mother send us grace!)
As if through a dungeon-grate he peered
With broad and burning face.

Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)
How fast she nears and nears!
Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,
Like restless gossameres?

Are those her ribs through which the Sun
Did peer, as through a grate?
And is that Woman all her crew?
Is that a DEATH? and are there two?
Is DEATH that woman's mate?

Her lips were red, her looks were free,
Her locks were yellow as gold:
Her skin was as white as leprosy,
The Night-mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she,
Who thicks man's blood with cold.

The naked hulk alongside came,
And the twain were casting dice;
'The game is done! I've won! I've won!'
Quoth she, and whistles thrice.

The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out;
At one stride comes the dark;
With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea,
Off shot the spectre-bark.

We listened and looked sideways up!
Fear at my heart, as at a cup,
My life-blood seemed to sip!
The stars were dim, and thick the night,
The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;
From the sails the dew did drip—
Till clomb above the eastern bar
The hornèd Moon, with one bright star
Within the nether tip.

One after one, by the star-dogged Moon,
Too quick for groan or sigh,
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,
And cursed me with his eye.

Four times fifty living men,
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
They dropped down one by one.

The souls did from their bodies fly,—
They fled to bliss or woe!
And every soul, it passed me by,
Like the whizz of my cross-bow!","There passed a weary time. Each throat was parched, and glazed each eye. We could nor laugh nor wail; through utter drought all dumb we stood. I bit my arm, I sucked the blood, and cried, A sail! a sail! Agape they heard me call: 'Gramercy!'","The third part of 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner' by Samuel Taylor Coleridge describes the “weary time” the sailors spend at sea. During this terrible period of time in the ship's journey, the sailors are incredibly parched. THere's a moment of hope when a speck comes close in the sky from the west, but due to their dehydration, no one can speak. The Mariner eventually bites his own arm and wets his lips with his blood. With this act, he's able to alert the crew to the ship on the horizon. Unfortunately, the joy turns to horror when they realize the ship is a ghost ship. The Mariner can see “Death” as a passenger on the ship as well as “Life-in-Death.” The two are playing dice for the crew and Life in Death has won the soul of the Mariner. The other sailors turn to curse the Mariner then one after the other the men drop dead on the ship."

In the first lines of this poem, the speaker talks to God, asking him to tone down nature if that pleases him. She wants the Eiger flattened, and the Grand Canyon made more bland. These changes should result in a far less overwhelming world, one that is less distracting and inspiring. Her request is clear sarcastic, meant to signal her broader appreciation for the natural world. The poem ends with a similar request, directed at God's grandeur itself."
758,"Cain lifts Crow, that heavy black bird
and strikes down Abel.

The poem begins with the speaker describing a scene from Genesis in which Cain kills his brother Abel. In this section, Crow is being used as a weapon. Additionally, the presence of Cain and Abel in the poem sets the stage for an intricate commentary about the way white men and women treat one another and the role made for Native Americans in this narrative. The narrative follows crow as he is taken advantage of by the white man in the form of a falcon, and abused by, and from within the wars that men wage. The poem continues on, passing more commentary on the way that man uses the bible to justify his actions. Native Americans are placed in the battle of Jericho and are born into the ashes of the fallen city. This is their past and future, as further represented in the following stanzas. Alexie’s speaker states that Crow is able, through the collection of beer bottles, to make 5 cents at a time. This pitiful amount is gained through the suffering of the population, many of whom are afflicted with alcoholism, and the suffering of Crow who is only able to take one bottle at a time. ‘Crow Testament’ concludes with Crow riding into a powwow on a pale horse. He is now representing Death, as portrayed in Revelations. No one is shocked to see him, it is as if it has been known from the beginning that “Death” is how their world would end. "

The lines of 'Postfeminism' are interesting and multilayered. The poem starts by drawing a line between women and soldiers or virgins and wolves. There are these two different type of people in the world, both fulfilling a role. It's from this initial premise that the rest of the poem spins off and “you” and “me” are put on opposite sides. There are different ways of addressing life and the speaker acknowledges these through complicated and sometimes confusing images."

In the case of this poem, it is probably safe to assume that the speaker is Grace Nichols, who is writing a praise song in honor of her mother. Nichols uses a series of metaphors to show just how much her mother meant to her. The poem is five stanzas long, and each stanza, with the exception of the final two, is three lines each; the fourth stanza, the poem's longest, contains five lines. 'Praise Song For My Mother' ends with only one line in the final stanza. It reads, “Go to your wide futures, you said.”"

In the poem 'The Void', Muktibodh depicts the void which we possess in our mind. It is generally a part of the subconscious mind in which our dark desires flourish. We can't neglect this dark side and this gloomy part of our mind makes us slaves. We serve this void by practicing anger, hatred, and demeaning someone. The more we do works that affect others, the more this dark side develops. It breeds its species into others. According to Muktibodh, it is like a communicable disease that is a threat to humanity."

The poem breaks down the period of waiting, in an unfamiliar environment, for the hospital to call with updates about sick children. For the parents that have children in the hospital, this place functions as a solitude, a place to wait nervously while the hospital works in the distance. The poem is restless, breaking down small aspects of the hotel, focusing restlessly on every detail. The final stanza of the poem ‘praise[s]’ the moment in which the parents find out their child is okay, and that they can all go home together."
763,"When I was a child
there was an old woman in our neighborhood whom we called The Witch.

window
from behind the wrinkled curtains

a few special animals?

to feed it soup?

The first person narrator of this poem recalls a memory from the childhood of an old woman that the children in the neighborhood referred to as “the Witch.” She comes to understand as she ages that she has become this woman and treated the woman from her youth unfairly. Not understanding at the time that she would become just like her. The speaker describes throughout the second stanza how she has become a hermit, just like the witch, and lives only with her overwhelming memories. Concluding that even though life may just be a “dream within a dream” she will continue to “[hold] [the] basket of fire,” and live on as best she can."

For instance, the speaker tells the reader that “people are illogical, unreasonable, and self-centered. Love them anyway.” Even though people are not always good or reasonable, it should not prevent one from loving and caring for them. In total, ten commandments are given, just like in the Old Testament of the Bible. While the commandments presented in this poem are not particularly religious, they do present themes that are also prevalent in the Bible. These themes include loving others, being a good and honest person, and helping those around you."
765,"Before you kissed me only winds of heaven
Had kissed me, and the tenderness of rain—
Now you have come, how can I care for kisses
Like theirs again?

I sought the sea, she sent her winds to meet me,
They surged about me singing of the south—
I turned my head away to keep still holy
Your kiss upon my mouth.

And swift sweet rains of shining April weather
Found not my lips where living kisses are;
I bowed my head lest they put out my glory
As rain puts out a star.

I am my love's and he is mine forever,
Sealed with a seal and safe forevermore—
Think you that I could let a beggar enter
Where a king stood before?","Before you kissed me only winds of heaven had kissed me, and the tenderness of rain. Now you have come, how can I care for kisses like theirs again? I am my love's and he is mine forever,   Sealed with a seal and safe forevermore.","'The Kiss' by Sara Teasdale is a direct and passionate poem about a speaker's connection to and care for her partner. The speaker begins the poem by noting that once she kissed her lover that there was no way she was ever going to want to be kissed by the winds of heaven again. Nothing can compare, she's saying. She also describes how she turns away from the sea winds in an effort to keep from losing his kiss on her mouth. The same perspective continues into the next lines. The speaker adds that she is her lover's forever. There is no way she'd ever want anyone else as they would pale in comparison to the person she's with now."
766,"There were not many fields
In which you had hopes for me
But sport was one of them.
On my twenty-first birthday
I was selected to play
For Grangegorman Mental Hospital
In an away game
Against Mullingar Mental Hospital.
I was a patient
In B Wing.
You drove all the way down,
Fifty miles,
To Mullingar to stand
On the sidelines and observe me.


I was fearful I would let down
Not only my team but you.
It was Gaelic football.
I was selected as goalkeeper.
There were big country men
On the Mullingar Mental Hospital team,
Men with gapped teeth, red faces,
Oily, frizzy hair, bushy eyebrows.
Their full forward line
Were over six foot tall
Fifteen stone in weight.
All three of them, I was informed,
Cases of schizophrenia.

There was a rumour
That their centre-half forward
Was an alcoholic solicitor
Who, in a lounge bar misunderstanding,
Had castrated his best friend
But that he had no memory of it.
He had meant well - it was said.
His best friend had to emigrate
To Nigeria.

To my surprise,
I did not flinch in the goals.
I made three or four spectacular saves,
Diving full stretch to turn
A certain goal around the corner,
Leaping high to tip another certain goal
Over the bar for a point.
It was my knowing
That you were standing on the sideline
That gave me the necessary motivation -
That will to die
That is as essential to sportsmen as to artists.
More than anybody it was you
I wanted to mesmerise, and after the game -
Grangegorman Mental Hospital
Having defeated Mullingar Mental Hospital
By 14 Goals and 38 points to 3 goals and 10 points -
Sniffing your approval, you shook hands with me.
'Well played, son'.


I may not have been mesmeric
But I had not been mediocre.
In your eyes I had achieved something at last.
On my twenty-first birthday I had played on a winning team
The Grangegorman Mental Hospital team.
Seldom if ever again in your eyes
Was I to rise to these heights.","There were not many fields in which you had hopes for me. But sport was one of them. On my twenty-first birthday I was selected to play Gaelic football. I made three or four spectacular saves, diving full stretch to turn a certain goal around the corner, leaping high to tip another certain goal over the bar.","'Sport' by Paul Duran is a moving, detailed poem that describes a football game and a son's worries and dreams for his father's approval. The poem begins with the speaker describing an upcoming football game. His hospital's team is going to play against another hospital's team. The fact that the speaker is in the hospital is not really addressed in the text. It is another detail in the speaker's personal life that within the larger themes of the poem is not important. What is important is the speaker's relationship with his father. He drove him 50 miles to play this game and the son expresses his concern that he's going to be a disappointment. Despite the size, strength, and backstories of the other team, (who have their own problems and reasons for being in the hospital) he was not intimidated. The son knew, as goalkeeper that day, that he had to do everything he could to impress his father. He played very well, far from mediocre, which is exactly what he wanted. After the game, much to his astonishment and joy, his father was proud of him. He shook his hand and told him he'd done well. This is a moment in the speaker's life that he remembers clearly years later. The poem ends solemnly with the speaker addressing the fact that “Seldom if ever” was he to rise to these same heights in his father's eyes again."
767,"I take off my shirt, I show you.
I shaved the hair out under my arms.
I roll up my pants, I scraped off the hair on my legs with a knife, getting white.
My hair is the color of chopped maples. My eyes dark as beans cooked in the south. (Coal fields in the moon on torn-up hills)
Skin polished as a Ming bowl
showing its blood cracks, its age, I have hundreds of names for the snow, for this, all of them quiet.
In the night I come to you and it seems a shame to waste my deepest shudders on a wall of a man.
You recognize strangers,
think you lived through destruction.
You can’t explain this night, my face, your memory.
You want to know what I know? Your own hands are lying.","I take off my shirt, I show you. My hair is the color of chopped maples. My eyes dark as beans cooked in the south. (Coal fields in the moon on torn-up hills) I have hundreds of names for the snow, for this, all of them quiet.","'Taking Off My Clothes' by Carolyn Forché is a thoughtful poem about a speaker's failing relationship. The speaker spends the lines of this piece analyzing the ways she's made to act as a woman in this relationship, as well as the way the man acts in return. She feels regret and is questioning her choices. She gives so much to him but is faced with an emotionless wall in return. The poem concludes with the speaker admitting that she knows that her partner's hands are lying to her when they touch her."
768,"I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,
And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by;
And the wheel’s kick and the wind’s song and the white sail’s shaking,
And a grey mist on the sea’s face, and a grey dawn breaking.
I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide
Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;
And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,
And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.
I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,
To the gull’s way and the whale’s way where the wind’s like a whetted knife;
And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover,
And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick’s over.","I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky, and all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by. The call of the running tide is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied, says the poet.","'Sea Fever' is brief and simple, yet its lyrical composition, repeated refrain, and poetic devices render it a perfect poem to be both read aloud or reflected upon in solitude. John Masefield's 'Sea Fever' is perhaps his most well-known work and describes the poet's longing to go to sea. Despite its first-person poetic voice, the principal theme of wanderlust is one that transcends the speaker and can be identified with by many. Masefield spent time as a sailor aboard different ships and therefore can effortlessly demonstrate his love for and affinity with this lifestyle."
769,"The most important thing we've learned,
So far as children are concerned,
Is never, NEVER, NEVER let
Them near your television set -
Or better still, just don't install
The idiotic thing at all.
In almost every house we've been,
We've watched them gaping at the screen.
They loll and slop and lounge about,
And stare until their eyes pop out.
(Last week in someone's place we saw
A dozen eyeballs on the floor.)
They sit and stare and stare and sit
Until they're hypnotised by it,
Until they're absolutely drunk
With all that shocking ghastly junk.
Oh yes, we know it keeps them still,
They don't climb out the window sill,
They never fight or kick or punch,
They leave you free to cook the lunch
And wash the dishes in the sink -
But did you ever stop to think,
To wonder just exactly what
This does to your beloved tot?
IT ROTS THE SENSE IN THE HEAD!
IT KILLS IMAGINATION DEAD!
IT CLOGS AND CLUTTERS UP THE MIND!
IT MAKES A CHILD SO DULL AND BLIND
HE CAN NO LONGER UNDERSTAND
A FANTASY, A FAIRYLAND!
HIS BRAIN BECOMES AS SOFT AS CHEESE!
HIS POWERS OF THINKING RUST AND FREEZE!
HE CANNOT THINK - HE ONLY SEES!
'All right! ' you'll cry. 'All right! ' you'll say,
'But if we take the set away,
What shall we do to entertain
Our darling children? Please explain! '
We'll answer this by asking you,
'What used the darling ones to do?
'How used they keep themselves contented
Before this monster was invented? '
Have you forgotten? Don't you know?
We'll say it very loud and slow:
THEY... USED... TO... READ! They'd READ and READ,
AND READ and READ, and then proceed
To READ some more. Great Scott! Gadzooks!
One half their lives was reading books!
The nursery shelves held books galore!
Books cluttered up the nursery floor!
And in the bedroom, by the bed,
More books were waiting to be read!
Such wondrous, fine, fantastic tales
Of dragons, gypsies, queens, and whales
And treasure isles, and distant shores
Where smugglers rowed with muffled oars,
And pirates wearing purple pants,
And sailing ships and elephants,
And cannibals crouching 'round the pot,
Stirring away at something hot.
(It smells so good, what can it be?
Good gracious, it's Penelope.)
The younger ones had Beatrix Potter
With Mr. Tod, the dirty rotter,
And Squirrel Nutkin, Pigling Bland,
And Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and-
Just How The Camel Got His Hump,
And How the Monkey Lost His Rump,
And Mr. Toad, and bless my soul,
There's Mr. Rat and Mr. Mole-
Oh, books, what books they used to know,
Those children living long ago!
So please, oh please, we beg, we pray,
Go throw your TV set away,
And in its place you can install
A lovely bookshelf on the wall.
Then fill the shelves with lots of books,
Ignoring all the dirty looks,
The screams and yells, the bites and kicks,
And children hitting you with sticks-
Fear not, because we promise you
That, in about a week or two
Of having nothing else to do,
They'll now begin to feel the need
Of having something to read.
And once they start - oh boy, oh boy!
You watch the slowly growing joy
That fills their hearts. They'll grow so keen
They'll wonder what they'd ever seen
In that ridiculous machine,
That nauseating, foul, unclean,
Repulsive television screen!
And later, each and every kid
Will love you more for what you did.","The most important thing we've learned about children is never, NEVER, NEVER let them near your television set - or better still, just don't install the idiotic thing at all. We've watched them gaping at the screen.

Dahl's speaker uses hyperbolic statements to reflect on the dangers of watching too much TV. They range from a child's brain-melting to the child's loss of the desire to understand the world. The speaker pleads with the parents to do whatever they can to get their kids away from the televisions. He knows the kids will not react well to this change but it will be in their best interest. Eventually, they will have no choice but to turn to the books that should have always covered their walls. Once the change is made they'll thank their parents and love them more than ever."
770,"And then the day came,
when the risk
to remain tight
in a bud
was more painful
than the risk
it took
to blossom.","And then the day came, when the risk was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. The risk was that the bud would remain tight. And so it did. The bud remained tight. But the bud blossomed. And then the risk became less painful.","Risk by Anaïs Nin is an eight-line poem that uses a garden metaphor to express a tale of change after turmoil. Little information is given about what led to this change, and there is also no indication as to whether or not this change proved a good thing. By cutting off the poem at these beginning and ending points, Nin has made this decision to change the focal point or the thing of significance within the poem. That change, as a theme for the poem, is treated like something to strive toward. Seemingly to the author, when we must push against conflicts, we should always strive to grow to be our best versions."
771,"High dormers are rising
So sharp and surprising,
And ponticum edges
The driveways of gravel;
Stone houses from ledges
Look down on ravines.
The vision can travel
From gable to gable,
Italianate mansion
And turretted stable,
A sylvan expansion
So varied and jolly
Where laurel and holly
Commingle their greens.

Serene on a Sunday
The sun glitters hotly
O'er mills that on Monday
With engines will hum.
By tramway excursion
To Dore and to Totley
In search of diversion
The millworkers come;
But in our arboreta
The sounds are discreeter
Of shoes upon stone -
The worshippers wending
To welcoming chapel,
Companioned or lone;
And over a pew there
See loveliness lean,
As Eve shows her apple
Through rich bombazine;
What love is born new there
In blushing eighteen!

Your prospects will please her,
The iron-king's daughter,
Up here on Broomhill;
Strange Hallamshire, County
Of dearth and of bounty,
Of brown tumbling water
And furnace and mill.
Your own Ebenezer
Looks down from his height
On back street and alley
And chemical valley
Laid out in the light;
On ugly and pretty
Where industry thrives
In this hill-shadowed city
Of razors and knives.","High dormers are rising so sharp and surprising, surprising, that they are surprising. The driveways of gravel;                Stone houses from ledges look down on ravines. The sun glitters hotly hotly hotly; the millworkers come; the sounds are discreeter.","'An Edwardian Sunday, Broomhill, Sheffield' by John Betjeman describes a city in South Yorkshire through complementary and honest verses. The poem depicts Broomhill, Sheffield from the perspective of a speaker who knows the area well. This person is familiar with the structures and types of buildings as well as their architecture. They take the reader through the streets and express their appreciation for the natural beauty surrounding the city. By the end of the poem, the Edwardian, historical image of the city starts to dissolve and modernity and industry creep in. It is a combination of then and now. It is both lacking and bountiful."
772,"I want you to know
one thing.

You know how this is:
if I look
at the crystal moon, at the red branch
of the slow autumn at my window,
if I touch
near the fire
the impalpable ash
or the wrinkled body of the log,
everything carries me to you,
as if everything that exists,
aromas, light, metals,
were little boats
that sail
toward those isles of yours that wait for me.

Well, now,
if little by little you stop loving me
I shall stop loving you little by little.

If suddenly
you forget me
do not look for me,
for I shall already have forgotten you.

If you think it long and mad,
the wind of banners
that passes through my life,
and you decide
to leave me at the shore
of the heart where I have roots,
remember
that on that day,
at that hour,
I shall lift my arms
and my roots will set off
to seek another land.

But
if each day,
each hour,
you feel that you are destined for me
with implacable sweetness,
if each day a flower
climbs up to your lips to seek me,
ah my love, ah my own,
in me all that fire is repeated,
in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,
my love feeds on your love, beloved,
and as long as you live it will be in your arms
without leaving mine.","I want you to know one thing. If you stop loving me, I shall stop loving you little by little.

In the beginning of the poem, Neruda presents a loving and romantic picture for his lover, reminding her of how much he loves her. However, towards the middle of the poem, his tone changes, warning her that if she stops loving him, he will also cease to love her. The tone in the last stanza of the poem reverts back to the positive, romantic tone in the first section of the poem, and the speaker tells his lover that if she does not forget him, if she keeps on loving him, he will forever love her in return. The poem highlights how intense, yet fickle, a love between a man and woman can be."
773,"I went to the orchard where no one for years has planted or pruned,
Where wild-suckering limbs break under the weight of the crowding fruit,
and hackberries grow choking the younger trees;
Where the gaps mature trees filled are the gaps between a poor woman’s teeth,
and the ground turned by the harrow when moisture was a thing remembered
is the cracked lip of a neglected child,
And the yellow weeds waist high the hair the dead keep growing.”

And though from a distance the leaves dull-green suggested the voices of those
who summers gathered each fruit in its turn—
the tart plums, the warm peaches, the ruddy pears (remarking
how unusually sweet this year the grapes sprawling over the fence)—
Up close they crackled, a brush fire spreading from where for days
it smoldered under the scorched grass.

I went to the one tree which bears every year without fail its pears, the birds
flapping their hollow bones at my approach.
Through the leaves a small bat uncurled like a wisp of smoke.
And for every pear I gathered there was one too ripe, and one the birds had pecked,
and one full of black weevils, and a dozen the masked raccoon
knocked to the ground,
Fruit once firm and good, given to the boot’s press,
And hornets rising each above a rotten globe.","I went to the orchard where no one for years has planted or pruned, where wild-suckering limbs break under the weight of the crowding fruit. For every pear I gathered there was one too ripe, and one the birds had pecked. And one full of black weevils, and a dozen the masked raccoon.","'The Orchard' by Robert A. Ayres describes a deserted orchard where the speaker visited and recorded the scenes with the help of his mind's lens. The speaker of this piece went to an orchard where none had planted anything for years. Trees kept growing at their own pace. In the month of summer, the branches were filled with fruits. There was nobody to taste or appreciate the beauty of the place except insects, birds, and animals. Only the speaker was there, sorrowfully looking at the scene and heaving a sigh of loss. He could sense the trees' grief as well. After roaming for a while, he gathered pears and discovered how different creatures fed on the ripe fruits."
774,"Most near, most dear, most loved, and most far,
Under the huge window where I often found her
Sitting as huge as Asia, seismic with laughter,
Gin and chicken helpless in her Irish hand,
Irresistible as Rabelais but most tender for
The lame dogs and hurt birds that surround her,—
She is a procession no one can follow after
But be like a little dog following a brass band.

She will not glance up at the bomber or condescend
To drop her gin and scuttle to a cellar,
But lean on the mahogany table like a mountain
Whom only faith can move, and so I send
O all her faith and all my love to tell her
That she will move from mourning into morning.","Most near, most dear, most loved, and most far, she was a woman of the world. She was as huge as Asia, seismic with laughter, helpless in her Irish hand, but most tender for the lame dogs and hurt birds that surround her. She is a procession no one can follow after, like a little dog following a brass band.","The poem, To My Mother, can be seen as an elegy for the speaker’s deceased mother, as he remembers her fondly and chronicles the aspects of her character which he shall miss most acutely. There is a sense that the Speaker is working through his grief at her loss through the poem. The main feature of the sonnet is a series of comparisons of the mother with huge geographical features, be they continents, earthquakes, or mountains. We can glean from these the extent of the Speaker/poet’s admiration for his mother, and thus also his devastation of her loss."
775,"We shall not always plant while others reap
The golden increment of bursting fruit,
Not always countenance, abject and mute,
That lesser men should hold their brothers cheap;
Not everlastingly while others sleep
Shall we beguile their limbs with mellow flute,
Not always bend to some more subtle brute;
We were not made to eternally weep.

The night whose sable breast relieves the stark,
White stars is no less lovely being dark,
And there are buds that cannot bloom at all
In light, but crumple, piteous, and fall;
So in the dark we hide the heart that bleeds,
And wait, and tend our agonizing seeds.","We shall not always plant while others reap.

In the first lines of 'From the Dark Tower,' the speaker begins by saying that “we,” Black men and women, aren't always going to be the ones doing all the hard work that others profit from. This suggests that now, that is the case. White people take the profit of the work that the speaker's community engages in. They won't always “countenance” or tolerate being treated as though they're inferior. The speaker says that “we” won't always have to submit to those who mistreat them or spend time thinking only about their suffering. The latter isn't going to last forever. In the second half of the sonnet, the speaker uses a metaphor to depict the Black community. He describes the sky as black and how just because it's dark doesn't mean it's any less beautiful or remarkable. Darkness has its pros, just as lightness does. There are some plants that can't live in the bright light of day. They instead bloom at night."

Tolkien is a simple and upbeat poem that speaks on the dreams and true nature of a seemingly simple, soft, and calm house cat. The poem uses rhyme throughout the short lines that make up its stanzas in order to express a cat's dreams. He does not dream as one might first think. There aren't little mice and bowls of milk on his mind, rather the larger prey of another life. He thinks about living freely, like a lion. In his mind, he's able to feast on all creatures, including people. He will, contrary to how it seems, never forget what it means to live freely."
777,"In the walled garden, surrounded by cold marble
and rows of sanctioned lime trees, I grow

defenseless against desire—I almost touch
myself remembering your scent, time zones away,

clean first, then that sourness

for so little: under the orange tree, a young woman
lifts from her lover’s hair a praying mantis,

its green intelligence like calligraphy
on her hand. Children scream, a man wipes

oil with bread—people still go to lunch

This poem presents a description of the walled garden of Babur, situated in Kabul, Afghanistan. The marble walls give a cold sensation to the speaker's heart. Moreover, the natural setting lits warm desires of her heart. Therefore, she starts to miss her lover many “time zones away.” She remembers the tangy taste she felt after having sex. Thereafter, the speaker describes what others are doing in the garden. The image of a man wiping oil on bread, makes her feel hungry. But her hunger is rather the sexual one. Only her lover can quench her thirst."

The poem uses two different speakers, a man, and a woman, the latter is presumably the poet herself. The man asks her why it's so easy for her to be kind “to people.” She answers that people have not always been kind to her. In between these two statements, Kaur includes a striking image, that of milk and honey dripping from her lips, two substances that are meant to embody a feeling of nourishment and wholesomeness."
779,"At the round earth's imagin'd corners, blow
Your trumpets, angels, and arise, arise
From death, you numberless infinities
Of souls, and to your scatter'd bodies go;
All whom the flood did, and fire shall o'erthrow,
All whom war, dearth, age, agues, tyrannies,
Despair, law, chance hath slain, and you whose eyes
Shall behold God and never taste death's woe.
But let them sleep, Lord, and me mourn a space,
For if above all these my sins abound,

The poem begins with the speaker directing angels at the corners of the earth to blow their trumpets and wake the dead. With this action, all those who have passed away, in all their “numberless infinites” will return to earth and seek out their bodies. From the first lines, it is clear this is a slightly altered description of the Christian apocalypse. The speaker describes how everyone will be able to take back their bodies. By the time a reader gets to the second half of the poem, lines nine through 12, a turn has occurred. Although the speaker seemed prepared for the end of the world in the first section, he changes his mind. He realizes he hasn't adequately repented for his own sins and begs God to teach him how to do it. The speaker states that if he were able to confess everything he has done to God, then it would be like receiving a blood pardon."
780,"That was the week
it didn’t stop snowing.
That was the week
five-fingered trees fell
on houses & power lines
broke like somebody waiting
for payday in a snowstorm.
That snow week, my daughter
& I trudged over the broken branches
fidgeting through snow
like hungry fingers through
an empty pocket.
Over the termite-hollowed stump
as squat as a flat tire.
Over the hollow
the fox dives into
when we open the back door at night.

Christmas card we could
remember while my daughter
poked around for the best place
to stand a snowman. One
with a pinecone nose.

picture once things warm up.","That was the week it didn’t stop snowing. Five-fingered trees fell on houses & power lines. That snow week, my daughter & I trudged over the broken branches. One with a pinecone nose. Another with thumb-pressedeyes to see the whole picture.","Matejka's Gymnopédies No. 1 explores themes of nature and family. In a moment where technology and electricity have been disabled by a falling tree, Matejka and his daughter get time to explore nature. They journey together through the landscape, seeing aspects of the wildlife such as a 'termite-hollowed stump' and the 'hollow' that a fox retreats to. The poem reflects on the silent beauty of quality time and remarks on how nature can enable these beautiful moments to take place."
781,"You begin this way:
this is your hand,
this is your eye,
that is a fish, blue and flat

the shape of an eye.

you like. This is yellow.

Outside the window
is the rain, green
because it is summer, and beyond that
the trees and then the world,
which is round and has only
the colors of these nine crayons.

This is the world, which is fuller
and more difficult to learn than I have said.
You are right to smudge it that way
with the red and then
the orange: the world burns.

Once you have learned these words
you will learn that there are more
words than you can ever learn.
The word hand floats above your hand
like a small cloud over a lake.
The word hand anchors
your hand to this table,

I hold between two words.

come back to, this is your hand.","You begin this way: ""This is your hand, this is your eye, that is a fish, blue and flat on the paper, almost the shape of an eye, almost like a fish"" This is yellow. This is the rain, green because it is summer, and beyond that the trees and then the world, which is round and has only the colors of these nine crayons. The word hand floats above your hand like a small cloud over a lake.","You Begin' by Margaret Atwood is a moving poem that focuses on the importance of the “hand” and its representation as a symbol of beginnings and endings. The poem begins with the speaker telling a young listener that they “begin this way”. The first thing a person has is their “hand” and then their “eye”. These things represent the powers of agency and determination. She also points to a “fish, blue and flat / on the paper”. In the second stanza she goes through a few colours, and then reveals that in fact there are far more colours in the world that we can ever know. Eventually, she returns to the importance of the hand and the word itself as floating “above your hand / like a small cloud over a lake”. It hovers, and it “anchors / your hand to this table”. In the last three lines the speaker refers to the earth, her child's life and her own as having a beginning and an ending. All of it can be seen here, in “your hand”."
782,"The tree that never had to fight
For sun and sky and air and light,
But stood out in the open plain
And always got its share of rain,
Never became a forest king
But lived and died a scrubby thing.
The man who never had to toil
To gain and farm his patch of soil,
Who never had to win his share
Of sun and sky and light and air,
Never became a manly man
But lived and died as he began.
Good timber does not grow with ease,
The stronger wind, the stronger trees,
The further sky, the greater length,
The more the storm, the more the strength.
By sun and cold, by rain and snow,
In trees and men good timbers grow.
Where thickest lies the forest growth
We find the patriarchs of both.
And they hold counsel with the stars
Whose broken branches show the scars
Of many winds and much of strife.
This is the common law of life.","The tree that never had to fight for sun and sky and air and light,                But stood out in the open plain and always got its share of rain,                Never became a forest king                But lived and died a scrubby thing.                The stronger wind, the stronger trees,                The further sky, the greater length,                In trees and men good timbers grow.","Good Timber' by Douglas Malloch describes the way that trees of good timber and strong men are formed through hardship and struggle. The poem begins with the speaker describing how there are two types of trees and men. First, there are those who are readily given everything they need to survive. This type of person or tree never has to worry about where their food and water is going to come from. On the other hand, there are the trees and men who must fight, from birth, to survive. Their broken branches and scars are evidence of their ability to survive on and become “forest king[s].”"
783,"There’s an indescribable beauty in union
In two beings forming one new being
Entering each other’s world
Surrendering each other’s selves
Accepting the invitation to be everything to someone else
There’s an unparallelled bravery in union
In telling the one you love:
“The only way that we can truly win
Is if I think of you in everything I do
And honour every decision you faithfully include me in.”
Love gives union true meaning
It illuminates the path
It wants us to compromise, communicate and laugh
It wants us to elevate, appreciate without pride
Love is oblivious to the outside
Even with an audience of millions
Even when that love bears immortal significance
All of this is met with cordial indifference
By the two people at the heart of it
Two individuals when they started it
Becoming two halves of one partnership
Such is the beauty of union
Such is the beauty of union",There’s an indescribable beauty in union. In two beings forming one new being. In telling the one you love: “The only way that we can truly win is if I think of you in everything I do” And honour every decision you faithfully include me in”,"The Beauty of Union' by George the Poet is a fairly short poem in which the poet describes how love is what makes a union successful. The speaker begins the poem by speaking not the beauty of relationships such as the one formalized on May 19th, 2018. He depicts the union as strong and as a force that's going to combine two people into one. Together, the two will merge their lives and make decisions together. They will always think of one another and enjoy the beauty of their lives together without worry about the spotlight on them. "
784,"The world is charged with the grandeur of God.
It will flame out, like shining from shook foil;
It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil
Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod?
Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;
And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;
And wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the soil
Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.
And for all this, nature is never spent;
There lives the dearest freshness deep down things;
And though the last lights off the black West went
Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs —
Because the Holy Ghost over the bent
World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.","The world is charged with the grandeur of God. It will flame out, like shining from shook foil. It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil. Why do men then now not reck his rod? And all is seared with trade; bleared with toil.","The world is charged with the grandeur of God. It will flame out, like shining from shook foil; It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil In the poem, 'God's Grandeur by Gerard Manley Hopkins, the poet says that the world is filled to the brim with God's glory and splendour. God's glory manifests itself in two ways. At times, it flames out with sudden brilliance, as when a silver foil is shaken and it gives out glints of light. At other times, this glory becomes apparent over a period of time, as when the oil crushed from olives slowly oozes out and gathers into a thick pool. It is this second way which here arrests the poet's attention. It is noteworthy in connection with God's grandeur, which is the subject of this sonnet, that Hopkins had made a special and exhaustive study of St. Ignatius Loyola's book, The Spiritual Exercises, in which occurs the following passage: See God living in his creatures, in matter, giving it existence; in plants, giving them life; in animals, giving them consciousness; in men, giving them intelligence. Think of God energizing, as though. He was actually at work, in every created reality, in the sky, in matter, plants and fruits, herds and the like; it is He who creates them and keeps them in being, He who confers life or consciousness, and so on. Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod? Generations have trod, have trod, have trod; Through these lines, the poet asks why people no longer heed God's rod or recognizes the just punishment of God. The divine rod both smites the sinner and heals him. The reason, for people's heedlessness is that they have become fatalistic towards their misfortunes. People's senses have grown dull both to pain and to its cause. Life has become a monotonous and weary routine for them. And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil; And wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the soil Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod. In these lines of 'God's Grandeur', the poet says that people's love for money has left an ugly mark on everything in the world. The beauty of Nature has been defaced by human toil. The dirt and smell of human selfishness has infected the whole world of Nature. The earth is now bare, having lost all living beauty. Man is insensitive to this bareness: his feet feel neither the hardness nor the softness of the earth. And for all this, nature is never spent; There lives the dearest freshness deep down things; And though the last lights off the black West went Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs — Because the Holy Ghost over the bent World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings. In the above six lines of 'God's Grandeur, the poet's religious faith rises above this pessimistic picture of human life. The poet is able to look from darkness to light, from night to day, from winter to spring. In the depths of Nature, there is a never-failing source of freshness, with which the earth is renewed every time when spring comes. It is the continued brooding of the Holy Ghost over the “bent” world, which brings forth renewed life from generation to generation. The Holy Ghost looks after mankind with the same protective care as a dove looks after its young ones."

You can do anything.","Hey, Black Child' by Useni Eugene Perkins acts as a mantra, determinedly creating a new way for black children to think about their lives and futures. The poem makes use of repetition in order to inform a black child, over and over, that they are strong and capable of anything they want to do. The speaker addresses the listener, a young black child, and tells him/her that they can do anything they choose if they set their mind to it. The poem concludes by alluding to a future that is different from the poet's contemporary present. This is a future that has not yet come to pass in America, making this poem as relevant now as it was then."
786,"I worried a lot. Will the garden grow, will the rivers
flow in the right direction, will the earth turn
as it was taught, and if not how shall
I correct it?

can I do better?
Will I ever be able to sing, even the sparrows
can do it and I am, well,
hopeless.
Is my eyesight fading or am I just imagining it,
am I going to get rheumatism,
lockjaw, dementia?

And gave it up. And took my old body

From the world stopping turning, to the rivers flowing in the right direction, even if she is going blind. All these concerns plague her consciousness each day, until she finally learns in the final stanza to step outside, despite her anxiety, and sing to the world. Yet, Oliver understands this is not an easy thing to do, only achieving this when she has reached old age. Some argue that the poet is being slightly naive when writing that she just 'gave [anxiety] up', people suggesting that it is not simply that easy."
787,"MOURN with thee, and yet rejoice

'The Penitent' by Anne Brontë begins by capturing an unnamed person mourning before God. The speaker describes this person's disposition as not only necessary, but joyful. They imply that their subject's mourning means a genuine repentance of sins, which leads to salvation. With the mention of angels watching as well, this moment looks almost rapturous, thereby serving as a strong beginning for the poem. Soon after, the persona describes the mockery to come. They tell their subject that this rapturous moment will cost them, friends, and family. However, the persona offers comfort from God and encouraging advice. They urge these repentant souls to hold fast to their newfound faith because the God to whom they've come rejoices over their salvation."
788,"ACROSS the shimmering meadows--
Ah, when he came to me!
In the spring-time,
In the night-time,
In the starlight,
Beneath the hawthorn tree.
 
Up from the misty marsh-land--
Ah, when he climbed to me!
To my white bower,
To my sweet rest,
To my warm breast,
Beneath the hawthorn tree.

High in the hawthorn tree;
What the breeze tells,
What the rose smells,
What the stars shine--
Not what he said to me!","""A Song of Solomon"" was written in 17th-century England. The poem is about a young woman's first kiss with her lover. It was written about a man who came to her in the middle of the night. The song is called ""A Song Of Solomon"" and was written by Solomon himself.","The Hawthorn Tree' by Willa Cather depicts the past experiences of a speaker who came to know a mysterious male character in a beautiful natural setting. The poem begins with the speaker describing that setting. It was “spring-time” and “night-time” when he came to her. She was under the hawthorn tree and beneath a sky of stars. The speaker continues her description in the second stanza. Together they were in her bower and joined together in rest. There was an obvious closeness between the two as he was set against her “warm breast”. The poem concludes with the speaker telling the intended listener not to ask her what he told her in these moments. They are welcome instead to inquire about the birds, breeze, stars, and roses."
789,"Today, as I rode by,
I saw the brown leaves dropping from their tree
In a still afternoon,
When no wind whirled them whistling to the sky,
But thickly, silently,
They fell, like snowflakes wiping out the noon;
And wandered slowly thence
For thinking of a gallant multitude
Which now all withering lay,
Slain by no wind of age or pestilence,
But in their beauty strewed
Like snowflakes falling on the Flemish clay.","Today, as I rode by, I saw the brown leaves dropping from their tree. Thickly, silently, they fell, like snowflakes wiping out the noon. I wandered slowly thence, thinking of a gallant multitude. They now all withering lay,Slain by no wind of age or pestilence.","The Falling Leaves Analysis Despite the harsh realities that fit the historic context of November 1915, the poem, which can be read in full here, is a very calming piece. It follows a loose rhyming pattern; each line has a rhyming line that follows three lines later, resetting after six lines. The poem discusses a narrator who watches as leaves fall from a tree. There is no breeze as the leaves fall, so they simply drop to the ground to join a vast array of dead leaves on the ground. Given the historic nature of the poem (and the preface, “November 1915”), it is likely that the fallen leaves represent soldiers of war, who fall, one by one, only to collapse into a field of bodies (or perhaps a list of the dead) so vast their names, identities, and even physical bodies are simply lost forever. The poem references “for thinking of a gallant multitude,” which ties in a very sad theme connecting the poem to the frenzy of excitement for the war that might well have been the last positive things felt by the vast fields of the dead. The poem describes them as having died, “like snowflakes wiping out the noon.” This too is a very telling image — it depicts a scene of winter where, in the afternoon, the warmest time of day, snow begins to fall. The glorious metaphorical summer turns to a bitter winter as snowflakes start to fall — except instead of snowflakes, it is the bodies of soldiers that are covering the fields. The snowflakes metaphor appears again near the end of the poem. The winter analogies can be interpreted two ways; generally the silent, white blanket of snow is an image used as a metaphor for peacetime. Otherwise, it is indicative of the cold winter that essentially smothers and ends a great deal of plant life. The meaning seems to be dual here; for every snowflake, every body on the field, another unique life's struggle has ended, and the calm wording of the poem almost makes it seem as though the fields are peaceful. Alternatively, the image conjured by snowflakes is one made of a great many flakes, and it is a fitting analogy to point out exactly how many people have died fighting the war even as early in as 1915. The last line of the poem references the Flemish clay, though this might make more sense if it is referred to as “Flanders Fields” (“Flemish” typically refers to the people of Flanders in Belgium, near where a number of significant battles took place throughout the war). There is no physical location called Flanders Fields; the name was popularized by the poem In Flanders Fields); rather, the location refers to battles such as ones in Passchendaele and Ypres. When Margaret Cole saw and heard about World War One, she was an outsider, yes, but also a feminist watching only men die, and a pacifist strongly opposed to the war itself. The calm nature of The Falling Leaves is not a strong reflection of what she is best known for, but is a terrific tone to set on a piece that challenged common perceptions of the war effort. Its somber nature may have been what many needed to hear to reflect upon the purpose of the war, and it is likely that this was her intention in writing it. It is a sad chapter in human history when men fall like leaves and cover the ground like snowflakes. There is a vast array of poetry, music, and art that reflects the nature of this period, but few that can capture its sobriety and pain in quite the same way as could Margaret Postgate Cole when she watched the falling leaves."

The poem takes the reader through the basic reasons why the speaker believes there's no reason to feel melancholy. She taps into humanity's basic, decent nature, its strength, and goodness. Humans, she reminds the reader, are also animals and are just as much a part of the instinctual natural world as an ant is."

Throughout this poem, Neruda's speaker compares his lover to the ocean, in its smooth purity and flowing waters, as well as to the soil and its bounty. She's capable of creating life just as she's able to control the movements of the sea. She has a beautiful power about her, something that only a woman could have, and he's entranced by it. In the end, the poet concludes with his speaker describing her safe in his arms. Despite her power, he's there to protect her and allow her to rest in her dreams."
793,"Evening and the flat land,
Rich and sombre and always silent;
The miles of fresh-plowed soil,
Heavy and black, full of strength and harshness;

Sullen fires of sunset, fading,

Out of the earthy dusk.","Evening and the flat land, Rich and sombre and always silent. The miles of fresh-plowed soil, Heavy and black, full of strength and harshness.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that the world she lives in is as “Rich” as it is “silent.” It is flat, and covered in “miles of fresh-plowed soil.”This soil is extremely important as it gives those caring for its sustenance. It also plays host to “weeds” though, and is the cause of exhausted horses and men. The second half of the poem speaks on the experiences of “Youth” and how aging can be enhanced and impacted by growing up on the prairies. The land provides an important and inescapable backdrop to one's life."
794,"The Sun now rose upon the right:
Out of the sea came he,
Still hid in mist, and on the left
Went down into the sea.
And the good south wind still blew behind,
But no sweet bird did follow,
Nor any day for food or play
Came to the mariner's hollo!
And I had done a hellish thing,
And it would work 'em woe:
For all averred, I had killed the bird
That made the breeze to blow.
Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay,
That made the breeze to blow!

No bigger than the Moon.

We stuck, nor breath nor motion;

Upon a painted ocean.

Burnt green, and blue and white.

Of the Spirit that plagued us so;
Nine fathom deep he had followed us
From the land of mist and snow.
And every tongue, through utter drought,
Was withered at the root;
We could not speak, no more than if
We had been choked with soot.

Had I from old and young!

About my neck was hung.","The Sun now rose upon the right:.Out of the sea came he, still hid in mist, and on the left went down into the sea.

In this section of the poem, the Mariner describes what happened after he shot the albatross. They feel the absence of the bird and express dismay in regards to the Mariner's choice. The men try to justify what happened, suggesting that perhaps it actually brought them good luck. But, unfortunately the wind dies down and the calm sea becomes an omen of bad luck. The mean are stuck around water they can't drink."

To find that the utmost reward
Of daring should be still to dare.

The light of heaven falls whole and white
And is not shattered into dyes,
The light for ever is morning light;
The hills are verdured pasture-wise;
The angel hosts with freshness go,
And seek with laughter what to brave;—
And binding all is the hushed snow
Of the far-distant breaking wave.

And from a cliff-top is proclaimed
The gathering of the souls for birth,
The trial by existence named,
The obscuration upon earth.
And the slant spirits trooping by
In streams and cross- and counter-streams
Can but give ear to that sweet cry
For its suggestion of what dreams!

And the more loitering are turned
To view once more the sacrifice
Of those who for some good discerned
Will gladly give up paradise.
And a white shimmering concourse rolls
Toward the throne to witness there
The speeding of devoted souls
Which God makes his especial care.

And none are taken but who will,
Having first heard the life read out
That opens earthward, good and ill,
Beyond the shadow of a doubt;
And very beautifully God limns,
And tenderly, life’s little dream,
But naught extenuates or dims,
Setting the thing that is supreme.

Nor is there wanting in the press
Some spirit to stand simply forth,
Heroic in its nakedness,
Against the uttermost of earth.
The tale of earth’s unhonored things
Sounds nobler there than ’neath the sun;
And the mind whirls and the heart sings,
And a shout greets the daring one.

But always God speaks at the end:
‘One thought in agony of strife
The bravest would have by for friend,
The memory that he chose the life;
But the pure fate to which you go
Admits no memory of choice,
Or the woe were not earthly woe
To which you give the assenting voice.’

And so the choice must be again,
But the last choice is still the same;
And the awe passes wonder then,
And a hush falls for all acclaim.
And God has taken a flower of gold
And broken it, and used therefrom
The mystic link to bind and hold
Spirit to matter till death come.

’Tis of the essence of life here,
Though we choose greatly, still to lack
The lasting memory at all clear,
That life has for us on the wrack
Nothing but what we somehow chose;
Thus are we wholly stripped of pride
In the pain that has but one close,
Bearing it crushed and mystified.","Even the bravest that are slain                Shall not dissemble their surprise                On waking to find valor reign,                Even as on earth, in paradise;                And where they sought without the sword.                Wide field of asphodel fore’er,                To find that the utmost reward                Of daring should be still to dare.                 The light of heaven falls whole and white, and is not shattered into dyes, and the light for ever is morning light.","‘The Trial by Existence’ by Robert Frost is a profound and complex poem that delves into the themes of bravery, sacrifice and the enigmatic nature of life. The poem explores the surprises that even the bravest individuals encounter upon awakening in a realm where valor reigns, resembling both earth and paradise. Those who seek a peaceful afterlife are met with the realization that the ultimate reward for their daring is to continue daring. The heavenly light remains pure and undivided, casting a morning-like glow on the verdant hills. Angelic beings exude freshness and laughter as they eagerly seek new challenges. Binding everything together is the serene, distant breaking of ocean waves."
796,"for years the scenes bustled through him as he dreamed he was alive. then he felt real, and slammed
awake in the wet sheets screaming too fast, everything moves
too fast, and the edges of things are gone. four blocks away
a baseball was a dot against the sky, and he thought, my glove is too big, i will
drop the ball and it will be a home run. the snow falls too fast from the clouds, and night is dropped and
snatched back like a huge
joke. is that the ball, or is
it just a bird, and the ball is
somewhere else, and i will
miss it? and the edges are gone, my
hands melt into the walls, my hands do not end where the wall begins. should i move
forward, or back, or will the ball
come right to me? i know i will miss, because i always miss when it
takes so long. the wall has no surface, no edge, the wall
fades into the air and the air is my hand, and i am the wall. my arm is the syringe and thus i
become the nurse, i am you, nurse. if he gets
around the bases before the ball comes down, is it a home
run, even if i catch it? if we could slow down, and stop, we
would be one fused mass careening at too great a speed through
the emptiness. if i catch
the ball, our side will
be up, and i will have to bat, and i might strike out.","for years the scenes bustled through him as he dreamed he was alive. then he felt real, and slammed                awake in the wet sheets screaming too fast, everything moves                too fast, and the edges of things are gone. four blocks away a baseball was a dot against the sky, and he thought, my glove is too big, i will                drop the ball and it will be a home run.","A Poem about Baseballs' by Denis Johnson depicts baseball through the dream-like perspective of a man riddled with doubts and uncertainties about life. The poem takes the reader through a stream of consciousness description of baseball. It focuses primarily on the speaker who is watching a ball move through the air. He questions it, himself, the game, and what will happen if he does and does not catch the ball. Everything is up in the air throughout this poem. It acts as a metaphor for life and major life events that determine our paths. If the speaker catches or does not catch the ball two very different things will happen."
797,"Drink to me only with thine eyes,
And I will pledge with mine;
Or leave a kiss but in the cup,
And I’ll not look for wine.
The thirst that from the soul doth rise
Doth ask a drink divine;
But might I of Jove’s nectar sup,
I would not change for thine.
I sent thee late a rosy wreath,
Not so much honouring thee
As giving it a hope, that there
It could not withered be.
But thou thereon didst only breathe,
And sent’st it back to me;
Since when it grows, and smells, I swear,
Not of itself, but thee.","Drink to me only with thine eyes, and I will pledge with mine. Or leave a kiss but in the cup,                And I’ll not look for wine. The thirst that from the soul doth riseDoth ask a drink divine;                But might I of Jove’s nectar sup,                I would not change for thine.","'Song: to Celia' by Ben Jonson describes the deep love which exists between the speaker and his lover and how it transcends normal bounds. The poem begins with the speaker suggesting that his lover “Drink to” him with only her eyes. He will reciprocate this act by, with his own eyes, pledging himself to her. This wordless communication is extremely intimate and is a suiting introduction to the dynamic which exists between the two. The poet is invested in comparing his love, and the indulgent way he participates in it, to drinking. He could find her love, if she placed it there, within a wine glass. In the last part of this stanza he says that the thirst he has for love could only be sated by the strongest, and most divine of drinks. In the second stanza, the speaker describes an interaction that he instigated. This situation is utilized as a perfect representation of how he sees his lover and how they communicate with one another. He sends her a “rosy wreath” and instead of keeping it, she sends it back to him after breathing on it. The speaker declares that the smell of the plant has been supplanted by the smells of his lover."
798,"An ant on the tablecloth
Ran into a dormant moth
Of many times his size.
He showed not the least surprise.
His business wasn't with such.
He gave it scarcely a touch,
And was off on his duty run.
Yet if he encountered one
Of the hive's enquiry squad
Whose work is to find out God
And the nature of time and space,
He would put him onto the case.
Ants are a curious race;
One crossing with hurried tread
The body of one of their dead
Isn't given a moment's arrest-
Seems not even impressed.
But he no doubt reports to any
With whom he crosses antennae,
And they no doubt report
To the higher-up at court.
Then word goes forth in Formic:
""Death's come to Jerry McCormic,
Our selfless forager Jerry.
Will the special Janizary
Whose office it is to bury
The dead of the commissary
Go bring him home to his people.
Lay him in state on a sepal.
Wrap him for shroud in a petal.
Embalm him with ichor of nettle.
This is the word of your Queen.""
And presently on the scene
Appears a solemn mortician;
And taking formal position,
With feelers calmly atwiddle,
Seizes the dead by the middle,
And heaving him high in air,
Carries him out of there.
No one stands round to stare.
It is nobody else's affair
It couldn't be called ungentle
But how thoroughly departmental","An ant on the tablecloth                Ran into a dormant moth                Of many times his size.                His business wasn't with such.                He gave it scarcely a touch,                And was off on his duty run.                Yet if he encountered one                Of the hive's enquiry squad                Whose work is to find out God                And the nature of time and space,                He would put him onto the case.","'Departmental' by Robert Frost is a clever and satirical poem about the rules of the ant world. In the first lines of this poem, the poet emphasizes how uncurious ants are. If one encounters something strange or new, they aren't going to investigate unless it's their job to do so. The same can be said for an ant who encounters the dead body of one of its comrades. It's not their job to care about it. The Queen gives out commands and everyone obeys without questioning her. The poem concludes with the description of ants' lives as “departmental.”"
799,"When you get what you want in your struggle for self
And the world makes you king for a day
Just go to the mirror and look at yourself
And see what that man has to say.

For it isn’t your father, or mother, or wife
Whose judgment upon you must pass
The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life
Is the one staring back from the glass.

He’s the fellow to please – never mind all the rest
For he’s with you, clear to the end
And you’ve passed your most difficult, dangerous test
If the man in the glass is your friend.

You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years
And get pats on the back as you pass
But your final reward will be heartache and tears
If you’ve cheated the man in the glass.","When you get what you want in your struggle for self-preservation, the world makes you king for a day. The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life is the one staring back from the glass. He’s the fellow to please – never mind all the rest, clear to the end.","The Meaning of The Guy in the Glass 'The Guy in the Glass' by Peter Dale Wimbrow Sr. is an inspirational poem that asks the reader to consider their life and their choices. The poem is addressed to a general listener, anyone who is alive to read or hear it. The speaker asks this listener to remember throughout their life that they are the only ones whose judgment really matters. When things go right it is important to look in the mirror and try to understand how that “fellow” sees things. If one is right with their conscience then they can move through life freely and happily."
800,"As one who, groping in a narrow stair,
Hath a strong sound of bells upon his ears,
Which, being at a distance off, appears
Quite close to him because of the pent air:
So with this France. She stumbles file and square
Darkling and without space for breath: each one
Who hears the thunder says: “It shall anon
Be in among her ranks to scatter her.”
This may be; and it may be that the storm
Is spent in rain upon the unscathed seas,
Or wasteth other countries ere it die:
Till she,—having climbed always through the swarm
Of darkness and of hurtling sound,—from these
Shall step forth on the light in a still sky.","As one who, groping in a narrow stair,Hath a strong sound of bells upon his ears,                Which, being at a distance off, appearsQuite close to him because of the pent air.                So with this France.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is one “who” is making his way through a “narrow stair.” This is a direct reference to the title, placing the speaker within Notre Dame cathedral. The pathway is cramped and loud with the sound of bells he knows are far off. In the next stanza, Rossetti's speaker relates the environment of the stairwell and how he felt within it, to France as a whole. There is a storm pressing down on the country. The people have become restless and ready for a change. This is a reference to the February Revolution that took place in France in 1848. It was just one of a number of revolutionary movements in Europe aimed at ridding the continent of monarchical rule. The storm is building at a distance from the country, but it feels very close. It might come into the city center, or it might blow itself out at sea. He also posits the possibility that it moves on to another country and works away at another population. Whatever the case may be, the speaker knows that eventually France will escape from underneath the dark skies and step out into the light."
801,"I loved you: yet the love, maybe,
Has not extinguished in my heart;
But hence may not it trouble thee;
I do not want to make you sad.
I loved you hopelessly and mutely,
Now with shyness, now with jealousy being vexed;
I loved you so sincerely, so fondly,
Likewise may someone love you next.
Translation by Emil Sharafutdinov:
I loved you; even now I must confess,
Some embers of my love their fire retain;
But do not let it cause you more distress,
I do not want to sadden you again.
Hopeless and tonguetied, yet I loved you dearly
With pangs the jealous and the timid know;
So tenderly I love you, so sincerely,
I pray God grant another love you so.","I loved you hopelessly and mutely, now with jealousy being vexed. I loved you so sincerely, so fondly,Likewise may someone love you next. I pray God grant another love you so. I do not want to sadden you again. I love you, so sincerely.","I Loved You' by Alexander Pushkin is a simple but effective poem in which the speaker expresses his devotion and respect for a woman he loved. He tells the listener, his past beloved, that despite the end of whatever relationship they had, he still maintains some love in his heart for her. This is not something that makes him sad, nor should it make her sad. He is only telling her so that she knows the depth of his affection. The speaker lists out some of the many ways he has loved her, from jealousy to hopelessly. The poem concludes with the speaker telling the woman that he hopes that God grants her another man to love her in the same way again."
802,"All night the sound had
come back again,
and again falls
this quiet, persistent rain.
 
What am I to myself
that must be remembered,
insisted upon
so often? Is it
 
that never the ease,
even the hardness,
of rain falling
will have for me
 
something other than this,
something not so insistent—
am I to be locked in this
final uneasiness.
 
Love, if you love me,
lie next to me.
Be for me, like rain,
the getting out
 
of the tiredness, the fatuousness, the semi-
lust of intentional indifference.
Be wet
with a decent happiness.","All night the sound had                come back again again, and again falls again, this quiet, persistent rain. Is it never the ease, even the hardness, of rain falling that will have for me something other than this, something not so insistent? I to be locked in this final uneasiness. Love, if you love me, lie next to me.","The Rain' by Robert Creeley is a beautiful short poem that expresses a speaker's desire to be loved like rain. The speaker starts the poem by talking broadly about the past and the ways they've experienced relationships. They don't want things to continue the way they were. Instead, they are looking for something different. They address their lover and asks that they be loved like rain in a way that's cleaning and comforting. It should balance out the instability of everyday life."
803,"I have gone backward in the work,
The labour has not sped,
Drowsy and dark my spirit lies,
Heavy and dull as lead.
How can I rouse my sinking soul
From such a lethargy?
How can I break these iron chains,
And set my spirit free?

There have been times when I have mourned,
In anguish o'er the past;
And raised my suppliant hands on high,
While tears fell thick and fast,

And prayed to have my sins forgiven
With such a fervent zeal,
An earnest grief --- a strong desire
That now I cannot feel!

And vowed to trample on my sins,
And called on Heaven to aid
My spirit in her firm resolves
And hear the vows I made.

And I have felt so full of love,
So strong in spirit then,
As if my heart would never cool
Or wander back again.

And yet, alas! how many times
My feet have gone astray,
How oft have I forgot my God,
How greatly fallen away!

My sins increase, my love grows cold,
And Hope within me dies,
And Faith itself is wavering now,
O how shall I arise!

I cannot weep but I can pray,
Then let me not despair;
Lord Jesus, save me lest I die,
And hear a wretch's prayer.","I have gone backward in the work, the labour has not sped,                Drowsy and dark my spirit lies,                Heavy and dull as lead.                How can I rouse my sinking soul from such a lethargy?                I cannot weep but I can pray,774Then let me not despair;774Lord Jesus, save me lest I die,774.","'Despondency' by Anne Brontë is a Christian poem revealing the thoughts of a speaker on their waning passion for God. 'Despondency' begins with the speaker's “aha” moment. It suddenly dawns on the poet persona that their “work” has regressed. (Later in the poem, readers get to know the speaker's “work” is seeking God.) They mention how weak their spirit has become—hinting at the spirituality of the poem—before asking how they can be free from fatigue. Readers begin to understand the urgency of the speaker's question as they glimpse moments of intense passion from the speaker's past. The persona's craving for God so deeply that they cried often provides a sharp contrast to their present state. Though the speaker doesn't reveal how they'd got to that state, recalling their past grieves them. Towards the end of the poem, grief leads to lamentation. The speaker moans about how they walked away from their work and expresses a strong desire to return to it. In conclusion, the outburst simmers down and the speaker becomes more hopeful. They encourage themselves to pray—and “not despair”—for their passion for God to be rekindled."
804,"How smoothly the trains run beyond the Missouri;
Even in my sleep I know when I have crossed
the river.
The wheels turn as if they were glad to go;
The sharp curves and windings left behind,
The roadway wide open,
(The crooked straight
And the rough places plain.)
They run smoothly, they run softly, too.
There is not noise enough to trouble the lightest
sleeper.
Nor jolting to wake the weary-hearted.
I open my window and let the air blow in,
The air of morning,
That smells of grass and earth -
Earth, the grain-giver.
How smoothly the trains run beyond the Missouri;
Even in my sleep I know when I have crossed
the river.
The wheels turn as if they were glad to go;
They run like running water,
Like Youth, running away...
They spin bright along the bright rails,
Singing and humming,
Singing and humming,
They run remembering,
They run rejoicing,
As if they, too, were going home.","How smoothly the trains run beyond the Missouri; even in my sleep I know when I have crossed. The wheels turn as if they were glad to go; the sharp curves and windings left behind, the roadway wide open. They run like running water, like Youth, running away.","'Going Home (Burlington Route)' by Willa Cather describes the change that comes over the train once it passes over the Missouri river. The poem begins with the speaker complimenting the way a train runs. When one passes “beyond the Missouri” everything goes calm. The speaker personifies the train, describing how its wheels turn so smoothly that they seem to be “glad to go” down the track. Or, later on, that they run as if they have youthful energy. Once over the Missouri River, everything seems calm because all the dangerous bits of the road are left behind. The speaker is moving closer and closer to her home, and whatever happiness she feels is projected onto the train."
805,"Webster was much possessed by death
And saw the skull beneath the skin;
And breastless creatures under ground
Leaned backward with a lipless grin.
Daffodil bulbs instead of balls
Stared from the sockets of the eyes!
He knew that thought clings round dead limbs
Tightening its lusts and luxuries.
Donne, I suppose, was such another
Who found no substitute for sense,
To seize and clutch and penetrate;
Expert beyond experience,
He knew the anguish of the marrow
The ague of the skeleton;
No contact possible to flesh
Allayed the fever of the bone.

And even the Abstract Entities
Circumambulate her charm;
But our lot crawls between dry ribs

The sleek Brazilian jaguar does not in its arboreal gloomDistil so rank a feline smell. Even the Abstract EntitiesCircumambulate her charm.,"Whispers of Immortality' by T.S. Eliot describes the connection between life, death, love, and sex and how ultimately death becomes the most important thing in life. The poem begins with the speaker describing how John Webster, a dramatist, thought about life and death. He, as well as other writers such as John Donne, saw the truth of death beneath life. They were able to use their own knowledge to investigate deeper and discover its presence within everyone's bones. The second half of the poem introduces sex into life. There is one character of note, Grishkin, who is used as a representative of life and passion. She is a sexual person but even when one enters into her breast they will find cold bones and eventual death. The poem ends with the speaker describing how the study of the presence of death will become all consuming. "
806,"To be in love
Is to touch with a lighter hand.
In yourself you stretch, you are well.
You look at things
Through his eyes.
A cardinal is red.
A sky is blue.
Suddenly you know he knows too.
He is not there but
You know you are tasting together
The winter, or a light spring weather.
His hand to take your hand is overmuch.
Too much to bear.
You cannot look in his eyes
Because your pulse must not say
What must not be said.
When he
Shuts a door-
Is not there_
Your arms are water.
And you are free
With a ghastly freedom.
You are the beautiful half
Of a golden hurt.
You remember and covet his mouth
To touch, to whisper on.
Oh when to declare
Is certain Death!
Oh when to apprize
Is to mesmerize,
To see fall down, the Column of Gold,
Into the commonest ash.","To be in love is to touch with a lighter hand. To see fall down, the Column of Gold, is to mesmerize. To touch, to whisper on is to be mesmerized. To be free is to have a ghastly freedom. To know you are tasting together is to know he is not there.","To Be in Love' by Gwendolyn Brooks describes the love that is going to exist between a listener and a man. She details what will be their ups, downs, and intense emotional connection. The poem begins with the speaker outlining a number of facts about love and what occurs around the emotion. There are not any details regarding who the listener of this piece is, but one can assume it is someone who is about to be or has just started falling in love. The speaker is giving advice to this person in the form of summarizing what love is really like. She states that “you” will begin to see through his eyes and feel what he feels even when “you” are separated. The feelings will be so intense “you” cannot even look into his eyes or comprehend moments when the door is “shut.” The poem concludes with the speaker describing the difficult process of coming to terms with what being in love is like. She speaks from experience about how the “Column of Gold” that initially represents a relationship might become “the commonest ash.” This occurs when problems become more universally understood. "
807,"The earth keeps some vibration going
There in your heart, and that is you.
And if the people find you can fiddle,
Why, fiddle you must, for all your life.
What do you see, a harvest of clover?
Or a meadow to walk through to the river?
The wind's in the corn; you rub your hands
For beeves hereafter ready for market;
Or else you hear the rustle of skirts
Like the girls when dancing at Little Grove.
To Cooney Potter a pillar of dust
Or whirling leaves meant ruinous drouth;
They looked to me like Red-Head Sammy
Stepping it off, to ""Toor-a-Loor.""

Not to speak of getting more,
With a medley of horns, bassoons and piccolos
Stirred in my brain by crows and robins
And the creak of a wind-mill--only these?
And I never started to plow in my life
That some one did not stop in the road
And take me away to a dance or picnic.

I ended up with a broken fiddle--
And a broken laugh, and a thousand memories,
And not a single regret.","The earth keeps some vibration going                There in your heart, and that is you.                And if the people find you can fiddle,                Why, fiddle you must, for all your life.                I ended up with a broken fiddle--                And a broken laugh, and a thousand memories,                And not a single regret.","'Fiddler Jones' by Edgar Lee Masters is an account of Fiddler Jones, who played the fiddle throughout his life. In this poem, Masters highlights how it is important to follow one's passion rather than running after money and wealth. Throughout the poem, he draws contrast upon the life led by an opportunistic farmer and an inspired musician. Fiddler Jones refers to farmer Cooney Potter who had turned his share of forty acres into a thousand and still aimed for more. In the eyes of Jones, a person could see two things by looking at a farm: one, an opportunity for wealth, and two, a walk in the meadow which would be a great memory someday. Whenever Jones thought of plowing, someone came along to make him play his fiddle, which he did not mind because he enjoyed it. Fiddler Jones was one of the few characters in Spoon River who did not have many regrets, and this poem explains a part of the reason behind his confident statement, “I ended up with forty acres … And not a single regret.”"
808,"Bees build around red liver,
Ants build around black bone.
It has begun: the tearing, the trampling on silks,
It has begun: the breaking of glass, wood, copper, nickel, silver, foam
Of gypsum, iron sheets, violin strings, trumpets, leaves, *****, crystals.
****! Phosphorescent fire from yellow walls
Engulfs animal and human hair.


Bees build around the honeycomb of lungs,
Ants build around white bone.
Torn is paper, rubber, linen, leather, flax,
Fiber, fabrics, cellulose, snakeskin, wire.
The roof and the wall collapse in flame and heat seizes the foundations.
Now there is only the earth, sandy, trodden down,
With one leafless tree.


Slowly, boring a tunnel, a guardian mole makes his way,
With a small red lamp fastened to his forehead.
He touches buried bodies, counts them, pushes on,
He distinguishes human ashes by their luminous vapor,
The ashes of each man by a different part of the spectrum.
Bees build around a red trace.
Ants build around the place left by my body.


I am afraid, so afraid of the guardian mole.
He has swollen eyelids, like a Patriarch
Who has sat much in the light of candles
Reading the great book of the species.


What will I tell him, I, a Jew of the New Testament,
Waiting two thousand years for the second coming of Jesus?
My broken body will deliver me to his sight
And he will count me among the helpers of death:
The uncircumcised.","Bees build around red liver,                Ants build around black bone.                It has begun: the tearing, the trampling on silks.                Torn is paper, rubber, linen, leather, flax,                Fiber, fabrics, cellulose, snakeskin, wire.                The roof and the wall collapse in flame and heat seizes the foundations.","'A Poor Christian Looks at the Ghetto' by Czeslaw Milosz captures the vivid description of the demolished Warsaw Ghetto from the eyes of a “poor Christian”. 'A Poor Christian Looks at the Ghetto' by Czeslaw Milosz depicts the condition of the Warsaw Ghetto after the Germans demolished it. In the first two stanzas, the poet describes how the ghetto was destroyed. In the third stanza, the poet talks about a “guardian mole” that is somehow finding its way in between the corpses. The following stanza captures an ironic reference to the mole as a “Patriarch”. And in the final stanza, it becomes clear from whose perspective the poet picturizes the whole plot of the poem. The person is a “Jew of the New Testament” who appears as a survivor of the holocaust. After seeing such a heinous scene, he feels himself a sinner. The picture of the innocent men from his community lying in front of him makes him feel as if he is one of the “helpers of death”."
809,"Far down, down through the city’s great gaunt gut
The gray train rushing bears the weary wind;
In the packed cars the fans the crowd’s breath cut,
Leaving the sick and heavy air behind.
And pale-cheeked children seek the upper door
To give their summer jackets to the breeze;
Their laugh is swallowed in the deafening roar
Of captive wind that moans for fields and seas;
Seas cooling warm where native schooners drift
Through sleepy waters, while gulls wheel and sweep,
Waiting for windy waves the keels to lift
Lightly among the islands of the deep;
Islands of lofty palm trees blooming white
That led their perfume to the tropic sea,
Where fields lie idle in the dew-drenched night,
And the Trades float above them fresh and free.","Far down, down through the city’s great gaunt gut; the gray train rushing bears the weary wind. In the packed cars the fans the crowd's breath cut, leaving the sick and heavy air behind. And pale-cheeked children seek the upper door to give their summer jackets to the breeze; their laugh is swallowed in the deafening roar.","'Subway Wind' by Claude McKay is a beautiful and lyrical poem about a wind's longing to escape a subway tunnel. In the poem's first lines, the speaker begins by noting that far down within the city, a wind is trapped. Its moaning drowns out the sounds of children laughing as it longs for an escape from the cityscape. It's seeking a new world, one that's filled with nature and freedom. The wind, the speaker says, is longing to blow along the seashore. It wants to drift schooners and move birds through the sky. The poem ends with a clear allusion to freedom, allowing the reader to connect the wind's longing to any experience of their own."

The poem begins with the speaker noting how she and her mother finally got to kill the roaches in their kitchen. This required sweeping them off the ceiling and dealing with them falling to the ground and into their hair. The speaker was relieved after the task was done but, as time passed, she started to feel regret and considered what she'd done as murder. The roaches were living the best they could, and her fingers, like blades, had killed them."
811,"Who hath desired the Sea? - the sight of salt water unbounded - The heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the comber wind-hounded?
The sleek-barrelled swell before storm, grey, foamless, enormous, and growing
Stark calm on the lap of the Line or the crazy-eyed hurricane blowing - His Sea in no showing the same - his Sea and the same 'neath each showing:
His Sea as she slackens or thrills? So and no otherwise - so and no otherwise - hillmen desire their Hills! Who hath desired the Sea ? - the immense and contemptuous surges? The shudder, the stumble, the swerve, as the star-stabbing bowsprit emerges?
The orderly clouds of the Trades, the ridged, roaring sapphire thereunder - Unheralded cliff-haunting flaws and the headsail's low-volleying thunder - His Sea in no wonder the same - his Sea and the same through each wonder:
His Sea as she rages or stills? So and no otherwise - so and no otherwise - hillmen desire their Hills.
Who hath desired the Sea? Her menaces swift as her mercies? The in-rolling walls of the fog and the silver-winged breeze that disperses?
The unstable mined berg going South and the calvings and groans that declare it - White water half-guessed overside and the moon breaking timely to bare it - His Sea as his fathers have dared - his Sea as his children shall dare it:
His Sea as she serves him or kills? So and no otherwise - so and no otherwise - hillmen desire their Hills. Who hath desired the Sea? Her excellent loneliness rather
Than forecourts of kings, and her outermost pits than the streets where men gather
Inland, among dust, under trees - inland where the slayer may slay him - Inland, out of reach of her arms, and the bosom whereon he must lay him - His Sea from the first that betrayed - at the last that shall never betray him:
His Sea that his being fulfils? So and no otherwise - so and no otherwise - hillmen desire their Hills.","Who hath desired the Sea? - the sight of salt water unbounded - The heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the comber wind-hounded? The sleek-barrelled swell before storm, grey, foamless, enormous, and growing: His Sea in no showing the same.","'The Sea and the Hills' by Rudyard Kipling is a poem about the power of the ocean and how it generations have been attracted to it. In the stanzas of 'The Sea and the Hills,' Kipling's speaker asks readers to consider the many varied elements of the ocean. He uses personification, describing the ocean as “she” and depicting all of “her” unruly features. On the sea, sailors are at risk from all sides. Anything can happen, including being blown out of control by unpredictable and predictable winds and running into an iceberg in foggy weather. Throughout the text, Kipling also compares the desire to return to the sea, as one's ancestors have throughout time, to a perhaps more relatable desire to be on dry land, a symbol for home and safety."
812,"I am a little world made cunningly
Of elements and an angelic sprite,
But black sin hath betray'd to endless night
My world's both parts, and oh both parts must die.
You which beyond that heaven which was most high
Have found new spheres, and of new lands can write,
Pour new seas in mine eyes, that so I might
Drown my world with my weeping earnestly,
Or wash it, if it must be drown'd no more.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is made up of both good and evil. Normally the good control the bad, but at this point, the “black sin” within his heart has “betrayed” the rest of his soul. It has taken over more of his being than ever before. The speaker is desperate to do something about this and turns to God. Donne's speaker asks God to bring a flood over the world which will clean out everything bad and good within him, giving him a fresh start. This is not going to be possible though. Instead, God plans to bring fire and burn everything out of the speaker. He is excited by the possibility and more than ready to give himself over to God's punishing, and saving, hands."
813,"Snow:

The man turns and there — there — is his solitary track stretched out upon the world. The sun! A clutter of Yellow and Blue flakes — the manturns and there he is.,"'Blizzard' by William Carlos Williams is a picturesque poem that centers on the progression of history and time. Through this piece, the poet also shares his personal experiences. In this short poem consisting of only 15 lines, readers can find two dominant images. One is the “Snow” and another is the “blizzard”. The first line begins with a single word “Snow”. Its meaning is explored in the following lines. Williams compared it with time and moves on to the theme of history. The speaker of the poem asks for how long this blizzard existed. Thereafter, he presents the image of the sun, and its color is reflected in the snowflakes. In the picture, a few snow-covered trees come into view. Lastly, when the narrator turns to find if he can find any companions. He can not find one as he is all alone on the track."
814,"vI, being born a woman and distressed
By all the needs and notions of my kind,
Am urged by your propinquity to find
Your person fair, and feel a certain zest
To bear your body’s weight upon my breast:
So subtly is the fume of life designed,
To clarify the pulse and cloud the mind,
And leave me once again undone, possessed.
Think not for this, however, the poor treason
Of my stout blood against my staggering brain,
I shall remember you with love, or season
My scorn with pity,—let me make it plain:
I find this frenzy insufficient reason
For conversation when we meet again.","vI, being born a woman and distressed by all the needs and notions of my kind,                Am urged by your propinquity to find your person fair, and feel a certain zest                To bear your body’s weight upon my breast.                So subtly is the fume of life designed,                To clarify the pulse and cloud the mind,                And leave me once again undone, possessed.                Think not for this, however, the poor treason of my stout blood against my staggering brain,                I shall remember you with love, or season my scorn with pity.","'I, Being born a Woman and Distressed' by Edna St. Vincent Millay describes the emotional “frenzy” that relationships can evoke in women and how one may walk away, unpossessed. The poem begins with the speaker describing her own emotions when she is confronted with a potential lover. The man, just through his presence, is able to make her feel the “notions of” her kind. Her female biology makes her desire him whether her brain wants to or not. It is a feeling of “zest” she gets for the weight of him upon her. She knows, from experience, and from what she has been taught, that sex is meant to be a way that a man comes to possess a woman. The overpowering emotions that come along with it can cloud a woman's mind until she cannot see or think straight. Many believe this is how it has to be, but it is not. In the final section, she describes how she has the power to walk away from any man she chooses. She can be with a man, and then leave him if they have no emotional or mental connection. She is not made to be possessed."
815,"I have a rendezvous with Death
At some disputed barricade,
When Spring comes back with rustling shade
And apple-blossoms fill the air—
I have a rendezvous with Death
When Spring brings back blue days and fair.

And lead me into his dark land
And close my eyes and quench my breath—
It may be I shall pass him still.

On some scarred slope of battered hill,
When Spring comes round again this year
And the first meadow-flowers appear.

Pillowed in silk and scented down,
Where Love throbs out in blissful sleep,
Pulse nigh to pulse, and breath to breath,
Where hushed awakenings are dear ...

At midnight in some flaming town,
When Spring trips north again this year,
And I to my pledged word am true,
I shall not fail that rendezvous.","I have a rendezvous with Death at some disputed barricade, he writes. ""It may be he shall take my hand and lead me into his dark land,"" he adds. ""And I to my pledged word am true, I shall not fail that rendezvous""","'I Have a Rendezvous with Death' by Alan Seeger is a moving, wartime poem that describes the speaker's coming, unavoidable death. The three stanzas of the poem do different things. The first sets out the premise, describing the speaker's coming meeting with death. The second describes the speaker's interest and curiosity about what death is going to be like. In the final stanza, the speaker declares that it will be spring when he dies and he'll meet death as it is his duty to do so."

The speaker states that they are “water” in the first line. They are comparing themselves to water in an interesting way. Not that they exist in the same exact way that water does (aka its movements, wetness, etc.) but instead that they have some of the same strength and toughness that water does. They can provide life to those around them as well as take it away. Water is a necessary part of life, someone that all things need, in some capacity, to survive."

I'm just thinking of something to do""","‘A Silly Poem’ is exactly that, an almost frustratingly clever quip written by Milligan based on a line from Shakespeare’s ‘Hamlet’.

818,"In summer dusk the valley lies
With far-flung shadow veil;
A cloud-sea laps the precipice
Before the evening gale:
The welter of the cloud-waves grey
Cuts off from keenest sight
The glacier, looking out by day
O'er all the district, far away,
And crowned with golden light.
 
But o'er the smouldering cloud-wrack's flow,
Where gold and amber kiss,
Stands up the archipelago,
A home of shining peace.
The mountain eagle seems to sail
A ship far seen at even;
And over all a serried pale
Of peaks, like giants ranked in mail,
Fronts westward threatening heaven.
 
But look, a steading nestles, close
Beneath the ice-fields bound,
Where purple cliffs and glittering snows
The quiet home surround.
Here place and people seem to be
A world apart, alone; --
Cut off from men by spate and scree
It has a heaven more broad, more free,
A sunshine all its own.
 
Look: mute the saeter-maiden stays,
Half shadow, half aflame;
The deep, still vision of her gaze
Was never word to name.
She names it not herself, nor knows
What goal my be its will;
While cow-bells chime and alp-horn blows
It bears her where the sunset glows,
Or, maybe, further still.
 
Too brief, thy life on highland wolds
Where close the glaciers jut;
Too soon the snowstorm's cloak enfolds
Stone byre and pine-log hut.
Then wilt thou ply with hearth ablaze
The winter's well-worn tasks; --
But spin thy wool with cheerful face:
One sunset in the mountain pays
For all their winter asks.","In summer dusk the valley lies with far-flung shadow veil; a cloud-sea laps the precipice. The glacier, looking out by day, is crowned with golden light. But o'er the smouldering cloud-wrack's flow's flow, gold and amber kiss, the archipelago stands up.","One of the most important themes of this piece is the importance of living a good life and facing death satisfied with that life. By the time Ibsen got to the last stanza of the poem he had turned his speaker's descriptions towards a metaphor relating death to a coming snowstorm. Winter, for the people of the described mountain paradise, is like death. It takes over everything, blocks out their sun and forces them to the hard winter tasks. The speaker makes sure to state that the residents of the mountain are not depressed by this turn of events. They know their days of light and warmth more than make up for the winter ones."
819,"I need the sea because it teaches me.
I don’t know if I learn music or awareness,
if it’s a single wave or its vast existence,
or only its harsh voice or its shining
suggestion of fishes and ships.
The fact is that until I fall asleep,
in some magnetic way I move in
the university of the waves.

It’s not simply the shells crunched
as if some shivering planet
were giving signs of its gradual death;
no, I reconstruct the day out of a fragment,
the stalactite from the sliver of salt,
and the great god out of a spoonful.

What it taught me before, I keep. It’s air
ceaseless wind, water and sand.

It seems a small thing for a young person,
to have come here to live with his own fire;
nevertheless, the pulse that rose
and fell in its abyss,
the crackling of the blue cold,
the gradual wearing away of the star,
the soft unfolding of the wave
squandering snow with its foam,
the quiet power out there, sure
as a stone shrine in the depths,
replaced my world in which were growing
stubborn sorrow, gathering oblivion,
and my life changed suddenly:
as I became part of its pure movement.","I need the sea because it teaches me. I don’t know if I learn music or awareness.

This poem describes how the sea teaches the poet the art of living one's life to the fullest. The poem begins with the confusion of the speaker. He is not sure what exactly teaches him. Is it the waves or something else? However, from the following, Neruda starts to answer his question. Being a young man, the process seems tough for the speaker. However, the more he gets closer to the sea's calmness, the more he gets closer to its core. In this way, he becomes a part of “its pure movement.”"
820,"I placed a jar in Tennessee, And round it was, upon a hill. It made the slovenly wilderness Surround that hill.
The wilderness rose up to it,

It took dominion everywhere.","‘Anecdote of the Jar’ by Wallace Stevens is a poem that expresses, through the story of “a jar” and “a hill,” the progressive overtaking of industry over nature. In the final stanza, that overtaking is revealed to be a sad and absurd prospect since Stevens’s comparisons make it clear that he believes nature is far more remarkable than industry will ever be. While there are other explanations that could be applied to this poem, the heart of the plot is a reflection of this absurdity, making the three-stanzas a combined lament of the forsaking of nature for what was misinterpreted as betterment."

The poem begins with the speaker describing the ice mountains in the background. They are one of the first elements of the painting a viewer is drawn to. From there he moves forward to address the sturdy, but still tired, hunters. They are leading their dogs from the woods, down a snowy hill and back into town. Alongside the hunters is an inn, the sign for which Williams expresses interest in. The yard holds a big fire and women tending it. From there he moves down into the valley to mention the silhouetted skaters. Then finally, the poem concludes with what Williams states is Brueghel's final touch, the bush in the foreground."

The poem begins with the poet relaying the words of one colonel to another. The first gives his imperialistic opinion of the Irish. He thinks of them as less than fully human and in need of suffering in order to occupy themselves. The Famine, in his mind, is not something they really need to worry about, aside from making sure they don't rebel. There is a response, asking if it would be possible for a road project to be started. This project is what the title, 'The Famine Road,' refers to. The English created employment for these poor by starving people building roads that went nowhere and had no end. Inside this narrative of pain, suffering, and death there is a second story. It is told in brief tercets from the perspective of a doctor and then his patient, an infertile woman. Through the juxtaposition of these two separate narratives connections are made. The woman is given the last three lines of 'The Famine Road' and compares her own infertile, “Barren” body to the purposeless, destination-less nature of the Famine roads."

It is a beautiful poem, coming to an end within the image of 'sunlight', a classic image of happiness and growth."

He is absent at this point though, traveling far from her as the sun moves from the earth during the winter months. She frequently compares him to the sun and herself to earth.

They inspire him to think about the broader universe, and how connected all spheres, places, forms, and structures are. These things, no matter how far out of humanity's reach, are part of existence in the same way human beings are. All life, civilizations, languages, and peoples are part of the same similitude as well. This is a unifying message, one that should be uplifting and inspiring."
827,"I said I liked classical music.
It wasn’t exactly a lie.
I hoped he would get the impression
That my brow was acceptably high.

I said I liked classical music.
I mentioned Vivaldi and Bach.
And he asked me along to this concert.
Here we are, sitting in the half-dark.
I was thrilled to be asked to this concert.
I couldn’t care less what they play
But I’m trying my hardest to listen
So I’ll have something clever to say.

When I glance at his face it’s a picture
Of rapt concentration. I see
He is totally into this music
And quite undistracted by me.

1st Date - He

She said she liked classical music.
I implied I was keen on it too.
Though I don’t often go to a concert,
It wasn’t entirely untrue.

I looked for a suitable concert
And here we are, on our first date.
The traffic was dreadful this evening
And I arrived ten minutes late.

So we haven’t had much time for talking
And I’m a bit nervous. I see
She is totally lost in the music
And quite undistracted by me.
In that dress she is very attractive -
The neckline can’t fail to intrigue.
I musn’t appear too besotted.
Perhaps she is out of my league.

Where are we? I glance at the programme
But I’ve put my glasses away.
I’d better start paying attention
Or else I’ll have nothing to say.",I said I liked classical music. It wasn’t exactly a lie. I hoped he would get the impression that my brow was acceptably high. He asked me along to this concert. I see she is totally lost in the music. He is quite undistracted by me.,"irst Date She and First Date He’ is a classic comparison between a male and female perspective. It shows that we are not always as unlike as is suggested. The first person narrative for both poems works really well. It is fun to see things from two different perspectives. The fact that the poem from the male perspective is longer suggests that perhaps he has more to say? Or perhaps that he is overthinking, although the content suggests they are both doing that. The poem is filled with irony in that the two characters are clearly very similar and clearly enamored by one another but are both pretending to like classical music when in reality the fact that neither of them actually does is something that they have in common."
828,"My grandmothers were strong.
They followed plows and bent to toil.
They moved through fields sowing seed.
They touched earth and grain grew.

They were full of sturdiness and singing. They have many clean words to say. Why am I not as they?,"'Lineage' by Margaret Walker describes the strength of a speaker's enslaved female ancestors and how they suffered for that strength. The poem begins with the speaker describing the strength of her forbearers, particularly, the female ones. These women to whom she is related, either by blood or race, were forced to labor on plantations and farmlands. They were extraordinarily sturdy in their dispositions and physical ability as they “bent to toil.” These women were extremely strong in both mind and body. In the second stanza Walker continues to speak on all that her female ancestors had to go through. Their memories are rich with painfully strong memories that the speaker seems to be able to get a glance of. These women persevered and even though they suffered greatly, they still have “many clean words to say.” In the final lines of the poem the speaker asks whys is not as strong as they are."

I saw a creature, naked, bestial,
Who, squatting upon the ground,

In the first lines of this piece, the speaker comes upon a creature in the desert. He's squatting on the ground with his half-eaten heart in his hands. Rather than try to stop the creature from engaging in this act of self-destruction, the speaker expresses wonder at the act and asks him whether or not his heart is good. The creature responds, saying it's “bitter,” but he likes it because of this specific taste and because it's his own heart. He's taking joy, a greedy joy, from the act of consuming a part of himself."

Tolkien is a short but impactful poem that speaks to one of the major plot points of The Lord of the Rings. The poem has Aragorn, the future king of Gondor as its subject. In the first half, Bilbo is speaking vaguely on the nature of strength, the goodness of Aragorn's heart, and his strength. The second stanza speaks more directly to what his future has in store. There is a reference to his eventually crowning and to the reforging of the sword known as Narsil, an important symbol in the novels."
832,"When I think how far the onion has traveled
just to enter my stew today, I could kneel and praise
all small forgotten miracles,
crackly paper peeling on the drainboard,
pearly layers in smooth agreement,

The speaker starts the poem by describing how moved she becomes when she thinks about how far an onion has traveled to be in her kitchen. It's traveled and traveled, and now she's cutting it up, and it's falling apart perfectly. This is something that goes unappreciated by most people, and she wants to rectify that at this moment. She adds in the second half that the onion has a right to make people cry. It's continually being ignored in meals in favor of the meat or the smell, and this is how it gets people's attention. The poem concludes with the speaker suggesting that the onion, which disappears into the background for the sake of others, should have its time in the spotlight too."
833,"Louder than gulls the little children scream

But others fearlessly rush in, breast high,

The tale is told by a boatman who has sailed as far as Demerara and the Ivory Coast.","'The Beach' is a poem that utilizes the ocean as a metaphor for life. The poem begins with the narrator describing children having a fun day at the beach. They scream with delight as their fathers toss them into the water, while others bravely leap into it. The children are laughing and having a fun day. The next stanza of the poem introduces the “horny boatman”, who is very knowledgeable about the sea. He has traveled the ocean and has seen many things, so the children go to him to hear his stories. The poem ends with him warning the children that every ocean smells like tar."

When the narrator reaches a sense of clarity in what they are saying the stanzas return to three lines long. This is how the poem starts, the different length stanzas, therefore, represent uncertainty. "

836,"I saw a young mother
With eyes full of laughter
And two little shadows
Came following after.

Wherever she moved, 
They were always right there
Holding onto her skirts, 
Hanging onto her chair.

An adhesive pair.

As, day after day, 
your two little tagalongs
Get in your way?”

She smiled as she shook
Her pretty young head, 
And I'll always remember
The words that she said.

That run when you run, 
That laugh when you're happy
And hum when you hum—
For you only have shadows

When your life's filled with sun.”","I saw a young mother with eyes full of laughter and two little shadows. They were always right there, holding onto her skirts, hanging onto her chair. “It's good to have shadows that run when you run, that laugh when you're happy, and hum when you hum.”","'Two Little Shadows' conveys the joys of motherhood through the metaphor of two little shadows. In the first few lines of the poem, the poet begins by having the speaker describe a young mother walking with two little shadows following her around. These shadows, which are no doubt her children, are everywhere she is all the time. Someone asks her whether this fact doesn't at points irritate her, and she says no. The mother asserts that the shadows are just a reflection of the sunlight that having children brings into one's life."

In this poem's first lines, the speaker begins by asking that his poetry is not considered “idolatry.” He is writing about the same person all the time, but he's also varying how he writes, exploring three specific themes. They are beauty, kindness, and faithfulness, or as the speaker says, “Fair, kind, and true.” He concludes the poem by saying that since his love is so constant, so too will his verse be. The Fair Youth is the only example he's been able to find where these three themes live together in harmony."

839,"When foxes eat the last gold grape,
And the last white antelope is killed,

The speaker begins by describing how she will leave the world behind when the “last gold grape” is gone and the “last white antelope killed.” She is referencing the beautiful fascination that rare or revered objects hold in the world and how she has no desire to live in this world without them. She will cease her battles against mundanity and “escape” to a house she is planning to build. To do so she will need to shrink to “fairy size” and by doing so confound those that would seek to understand her. The world is so consumed by its own tedious problems, lacking in fascination, no one will be able to see or grasp what has happened to her. Their hands will be unwieldy, like mud, and their eyes blind as if obscured by cataracts. In the third stanza, the speaker describes how after she is gone others will search for her in the roots and branches of trees, but they will not find her. The monotonous nature of their lives will have blinded them to the more beautiful aspects of the world that still exist."

Merwin depicts the memorable events of John Keats' life alongside the felling of Sandalwood trees in Hawaii after the British colonization. In music, a chord means a group of notes sounds together harmoniously. The title of the poem describes the harmony in creation and destruction. This kind of amalgamation creates rather an unpleasant note of human history. Throughout this piece, Merwin alludes to a number of Keatsian poems and juxtaposes the main ideas with the gradual destruction of the Sandalwood forest in Hawaii. Lastly, the poet notes how one can decode this intricate language of human action."

In different tellings of various stories, these women were said to have been born from Atlas and Hesperis, or Erebus and Night. The women guard the apples alongside a dragon, Ladon.

And many a nymph who wreathes her brows with sedge
And sheds the fresh'ning dew, and lovelier still,
The pensive pleasures sweet

Cheers the lone heath, or some time-hallowed pile

At first, by describing the sky, he details how the day is about to end and the night is approaching. The creatures like a bat and beetle give the readers an auditory effect. By painting the ambiance, he tries to depict the calmness of nature in the evening. In the end, Collins presents the effect of seasons on her (Eve)."

This is a feature that only someone with an artistic inclination, or a child, could see. The speaker continues to describe how this map is one that describes her life. It shows the ups and downs and progress towards one particular way of being. The poem concludes with the speaker relating the material nature of the table to the dream-like qualities of thought and poetry. These elements are woven together, informing a reader that it is the form of the poem and the text it includes which makes it what it is."

'Full Moon and Little Frieda' effectively uses natural imagery and descriptive language to set the tone and atmosphere for the poem. The first stanza introduces several animals and household objects, evoking a sense of familiarity. Hughes uses metaphors to compare everyday occurrences to Frieda's strength, as well as give insight into the family history. The second stanza has an ominous atmosphere, wherein Hughes effectively uses contrasting colors and imagery to create suspense and tension. In the last lines of the stanza, Frieda seems to pull Hughes out of deep thought by repeatedly exclaiming 'moon.' Hughes admires his daughter's simple and raw outlook on the world. The final stanza collocates Hughes' amazement with Frieda's uncomplicated worldview with his ability to create a person that, while being fragile and small in stature, is incredibly resilient."
845,"I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,
And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.
He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;
And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.

The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow—
Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;
For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,
And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.

He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,
And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.
He stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see;
I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!

One morning, very early, before the sun was up,
I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;
But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,
Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.","I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me, says the little boy. He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head, writes the boy. The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow, the boy writes.","My Shadow' by Robert Louis Stevenson is told from the perspective of a child who is trying to understand what purpose his shadow serves. The poem begins with the speaker describing how there is another child who follows him everywhere. It sticks close to him when he is playing, so much it is embarrassing for them both. He also has the strange ability to shrink and grow quickly, not at all like a normal boy. The child's innocence and honest inquiry into the nature of his world is endearing and takes an adult reader back to a time before everything was made so much clearer through science."
846,"Once upon a time, in a busy shop

In the land of tribes and ancient civilizations

A little girl sat watching…

in silent resignation

Grown-up women with shrouds of black

Hidden and silent… in isolation

With a “no-trespassing” look

They wandered around in simulation

When a single woman appeared, suddenly, in the shop

The little girl felt a sudden sensation

Yes, the woman wore the black alright…

 

Yet, she walked with determination

Not cautious, fearful, or covered-up

The woman moved as a distinct population

She seemed to own the world

 

She was … such an inspiration…

Why would she be on her own? The little girl wondered?

Wasn’t she afraid from reprimands or accusations?

Looking that pretty in embroidered black,

Defying the norms as if in a celebration

Who gave her the money that she’s spending

Without a second thought or a hesitation?

Was she really confident and strong as she seemed?

Or is it the little girl’s wishful imagination????

 

In that little girl’s life

Most women shared a specific combination

Emotions were not revealed, opinions were suppressed

With lots of reservations

They held on to their black tightly

Least someone recognize their identifications

Their world seemed full of judging men

Watching for proofs of condemnation

So the women in black kept their covers tight

Protecting their reputation

 

Yet a single woman in black dared to show her face

Visible without a mask, in obvious relaxation!!

The little girl knew that something/ someone

Must explain that awkward observation

Of that visible woman in black

 

Despite the isolation… despite the limitations

As time passes-by,

The little girl grows in fascination

More visible women are out there

Raising their voices in frustration

They no longer accept second-places

They no-longer sat in resignation

The reality doors are shut but the virtual ones are forcedly-opened

With fierce determination

The women in black want their rights

Demanding full participation

Campaigning for municipal elections, driving,

Minimum marital age or right of self- representation

Commenting on international treaties for women,

Gender-equality, or women-rights affiliation

They are loud and visible

No longer silent, passive, or fearing condemnation

They write, blog, tweet, and post

In a constant flow of information

They build networks and constituencies

Unlimited by gender-segregation,

No longer helpless or maintained

As prisoners of infinite duration…

 

Yes, we are in a constant fear of social backlash

But the power of words defeats organizations

The little girl recalls the single woman in black…

Whenever she feels a hesitation…

Beautiful and powerful in her own way…

A woman, who defeats stagnation…

We will not be deprived

We are a different generation….

And if countries can be flipped over and start anew

In search of liberation

We, too, the women in black

Can exceed our own expectations","Once upon a time, in a busy shop, in the land of tribes and ancient civilizations, a little girl sat watching. She watched grown-up women with shrouds of black with a “no-trespassing” look. The little girl felt a sudden sensation when a single woman appeared in the shop.","The Women in Black' by Hala al-Dosari is a powerful poem about the equal rights movement in Saudi Arabia. The poem takes the reader through the streets of Saudi Arabia while explaining the way that women moved through the world. From the perspective of a little girl, the speaker marvels over the appearance of one woman who does not cover her face. This woman multiplies until it seems that the whole country has risen up in demand of equal treatment for men and women."
847,"My dog has died.
I buried him in the garden
next to a rusted old machine.

Some day I'll join him right there,
but now he's gone with his shaggy coat,
his bad manners and his cold nose,
and I, the materialist, who never believed
in any promised heaven in the sky
for any human being,
I believe in a heaven I'll never enter.
Yes, I believe in a heaven for all dogdom
where my dog waits for my arrival
waving his fan-like tail in friendship.

Ai, I'll not speak of sadness here on earth,
of having lost a companion
who was never servile.
His friendship for me, like that of a porcupine
withholding its authority,
was the friendship of a star, aloof,
with no more intimacy than was called for,
with no exaggerations:
he never climbed all over my clothes
filling me full of his hair or his mange,
he never rubbed up against my knee
like other dogs obsessed with sex.

No, my dog used to gaze at me,
paying me the attention I need,
the attention required
to make a vain person like me understand
that, being a dog, he was wasting time,
but, with those eyes so much purer than mine,
he'd keep on gazing at me
with a look that reserved for me alone
all his sweet and shaggy life,
always near me, never troubling me,
and asking nothing.

Ai, how many times have I envied his tail
as we walked together on the shores of the sea
in the lonely winter of Isla Negra
where the wintering birds filled the sky
and my hairy dog was jumping about
full of the voltage of the sea's movement:
my wandering dog, sniffing away
with his golden tail held high,
face to face with the ocean's spray.

Joyful, joyful, joyful,
as only dogs know how to be happy
with only the autonomy
of their shameless spirit.

There are no good-byes for my dog who has died,
and we don't now and never did lie to each other.

So now he's gone and I buried him,
and that's all there is to it.","My dog has died. I buried him in the garden next to a rusted old machine. Some day I'll join him right there. But now he's gone with his shaggy coat, his bad manners and his cold nose. And I, the materialist, who never believed in any promised heaven in the sky for any human being, believe in a heaven I'll never enter.","'A Dog Has Died' by Pablo Neruda is a moving elegy written after the death of the poet's reserved and yet joyful dog. Throughout the poem, the poet takes the reader through the different aspects of his dog's personality. He was not over-affectionate or overbearing. The dog did as he liked when he wanted to. He gave Neruda just enough attention for them to understand one another. Neruda spends the last stanzas of the poem discussing the joy his dog took in everything. He had the capacity to celebrate his life that humans don't have."
848,"Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away ere break of day
To seek the pale enchanted gold.

The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,
While hammers fell like ringing bells
In places deep, where dark things sleep,
In hollow halls beneath the fells.

For ancient king and elvish lord
There many a gleaming golden hoard
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught
To hide in gems on hilt of sword.

On silver necklaces they strung
The flowering stars, on crowns they hung
The dragon-fire, in twisted wire
They meshed the light of moon and sun.

Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away, ere break of day,
To claim our long-forgotten gold.

Goblets they carved there for themselves
And harps of gold; where no man delves
There lay they long, and many a song
Was sung unheard by men or elves.

The pines were roaring on the height,
The winds were moaning in the night.
The fire was red, it flaming spread;
The trees like torches blazed with light.

The bells were ringing in the dale
And men looked up with faces pale;
Then dragon’s ire more fierce than fire
Laid low their towers and houses frail.

The mountain smoked beneath the moon;
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.
They fled their hall, to dying fall
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.

Far over the misty mountains grim
To dungeons deep and caverns dim
We must away, ere break of day,
To win our harps and gold from him!","Far over the misty mountains cold, we must seek the pale enchanted gold. The dwarves of yore made mighty spells, while hammers fell like ringing bells. In places deep, where dark things sleep, they hid in hollow halls beneath the fells.

Tolkien depicts the destruction of Thorin Oakenshield's home and his desire to win it back from Smaug. The poem takes the reader through a series of images that were crafted to show the importance of the Lonely Mountain and all that which it contains. Inside, there are mountains of gold. These were laboured over by Thorin's ancestors and he, as the rightful king under the mountain, wants to win it back. The poem also describes the arrival of Smaug, the great dragon who killed almost all of his people and is now standing guard over their treasure."
849,"Did then the bold Slave rear at last the Sword
 Of Vengeance? drench'd he deep its thirsty blade
In the cold bosom of his tyrant lord?
 Oh! who shall blame him? thro' the midnight shade

 Of every past delight; his native grove,
 Friendship's best joys, and Liberty and Love,
All lost for ever! then Remembrance wrought

One day they will avenge the misdoings and stand up for their rights. Enough blood will be spilled to quench their anger. Thereafter, the poet describes the condition of a slave chained inside a chamber. He thinks of his past when he was free. However, at some point in time, he was taken into this trade. For this reason, he gets angry whenever he thinks of freedom. This anger leads to the dark desire of killing his lord. In this way, Southey anticipates the future of the slave trade."
850,"Facing west, from California's shores,
Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity, the
land of migrations, look afar,
Look off the shores of my Western Sea—the circle almost circled;
For, starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
From Asia—from the north—from the God, the sage, and the hero,
From the south—from the flowery peninsulas, and the spice islands;
Long having wander'd since—round the earth having wander'd,
Now I face home again—very pleas'd and joyous;
(But where is what I started for, so long ago?
And why is it yet unfound?)","Facing west, from California's shores, looking towards the house of maternity, seeking what is yet unfound, looking off the shores of my Western Sea. (But where is what I started for, so long ago?                And why is it yet unfounded?) ""I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the home of maternity"" ""The circle almost circled""","Written in 1860, many people believe 'Facing West From California's Shores' to have been written about California becoming the thirty-first state in America. The speaker of the poem seems to be the United States personified. The country is looking to the west from California, wondering what lands lie on the other side. With America's expansion into California, many came to the realization that it was the farthest the country could expand in the west. This poem recognizes that, but it also revels in looking at the old world from the shores of the new."
851,"Lovely tree,
Yesterday
wild winds of winter combed
your black and twining hair.
When dawn blinked
You emerged softly capped in ermine,
star-kissed with diamonds. Wind's sharp breath caught in his throat and sun, stricken sun, can't turn his eye from you","Lovely tree, tumultuous winds of winter combed your black and twining hair. You emerged softly capped in ermine, star-kissed with diamonds. Wind's sharp breath caught in his throat and sun, stricken sun, can't turn his eye from you.","'Snow Vision' by Rita Reed depicts, in skillful language, a personified tree, covered in snow at the beginning of a new day. The poet describes the tree as it looked “yesterday” when the dawn arose. This suggests, right from the beginning, that perhaps things are different now than they were then. Either way, she notes how the wind moved through the tree's “hair” and the dawn illuminated the snow on its leaves. The flakes shined, as if diamonds, reflecting the light of the sun. All the other natural elements, the wind, and sun are struck by the beauty of the tree at that moment. Its beauty, unlike theirs, is more fleeting. It will not look exactly this way again. In fact, it could disappear at any moment."
852,"One failure on
Top of another",One failure on top of another. One failure on one and one failure on another. A failure of one and a failure of two. A Failure of one to another. The Failure of One to Two. AFailure of Two to Three. ASuccess of Three to Four to Five.,"'Their Sex Life' is a short poem written by A. R. Ammons. The poem presents sexuality and relationships in modern times. In this short poem, A. R. Ammons summarizes the modern-day relationship and sex life of couples. By depicting an image of a couple having sex, the poet shows the emotional side of the couple. In that image, one can visualize a man/ woman on top of another and having sex. But, the addition of the word “failure” shows the emotional world of both the man and the woman. There is some sort of absence that is troubling both of them. Hence, it seems that they are in a mechanical process of love-making and somehow trying to exhale their frustration."
853,"I walk through the long schoolroom questioning;
A kind old nun in a white hood replies;
The children learn to cipher and to sing,
To study reading-books and history,
To cut and sew, be neat in everything
In the best modern way—the children's eyes
In momentary wonder stare upon
A sixty-year-old smiling public man.


I dream of a Ledaean body, bent
Above a sinking fire, a tale that she
Told of a harsh reproof, or trivial event
That changed some childish day to tragedy—
Told, and it seemed that our two natures blent
Into a sphere from youthful sympathy,
Or else, to alter Plato's parable,
Into the yolk and white of the one shell.



And thinking of that fit of grief or rage
I look upon one child or t'other there
And wonder if she stood so at that age—
For even daughters of the swan can share
Something of every paddler's heritage—
And had that colour upon cheek or hair,
And thereupon my heart is driven wild:
She stands before me as a living child.



Her present image floats into the mind—
Did Quattrocento finger fashion it
Hollow of cheek as though it drank the wind
And took a mess of shadows for its meat?
And I though never of Ledaean kind
Had pretty plumage once—enough of that,
Better to smile on all that smile, and show
There is a comfortable kind of old scarecrow.



What youthful mother, a shape upon her lap
Honey of generation had betrayed,
And that must sleep, shriek, struggle to escape
As recollection or the drug decide,
Would think her son, did she but see that shape
With sixty or more winters on its head,
A compensation for the pang of his birth,
Or the uncertainty of his setting forth?



Plato thought nature but a spume that plays
Upon a ghostly paradigm of things;
Solider Aristotle played the taws
Upon the bottom of a king of kings;
World-famous golden-thighed Pythagoras
Fingered upon a fiddle-stick or strings
What a star sang and careless Muses heard:
Old clothes upon old sticks to scare a bird.



Both nuns and mothers worship images,
But those the candles light are not as those
That animate a mother's reveries,
But keep a marble or a bronze repose.
And yet they too break hearts—O Presences
That passion, piety or affection knows,
And that all heavenly glory symbolise—
O self-born mockers of man's enterprise;




Labour is blossoming or dancing where
The body is not bruised to pleasure soul,
Nor beauty born out of its own despair,
Nor blear-eyed wisdom out of midnight oil.
O chestnut tree, great rooted blossomer,
Are you the leaf, the blossom or the bole?
O body swayed to music, O brightening glance,
How can we know the dancer from the dance?","I dream of a Ledaean body, bent over a sinking fire, a tale that she told of a harsh reproof, or trivial event that changed some childish day to tragedy. I wonder if she stood so at that age, and had that colour upon cheek or hair, and thereupon my heart is driven wild: she stands before me as a living child.","As the elderly speaker of “Among School Children” contemplates life, he begins to understand that there is beauty in life’s process: in the ongoing “blossoming” of the here and now. Life isn’t some static product, in other words, but rather a kind of continual movement from one moment to the next. Change (including the change entailed by growing older) is inseparable from life itself."
854,"Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,

Those who made false predictions are now laughing at themselves for suggesting that anything else could've happened. There was a time when things were uncertain, and the speaker didn't know for sure what was going to happen, but now he does. He knows that peace is here to stay and that due to this poem he's written, he and his true love are going to outsmart death. It will serve as their monument."

It is the early morning and the residents of the city are just starting their day. After “Betty,” Swift moves on to speak about cleaners and the different ways they work. These characters are followed by bill-collectors, thieves, a chimney-sweep, and a brickdust seller. All manner of the profession is mentioned by the speaker, emphasizing the wide-ranging types of existence in Swift's own time."
856,"There may be chaos still around the world,
This little world that in my thinking lies;
For mine own bosom is the paradise
Where all my life’s fair visions are unfurled.
Within my nature’s shell I slumber curled,
Unmindful of the changing outer skies,
Where now, perchance, some new-born Eros flies,
Or some old Cronos from his throne is hurled.
I heed them not; or if the subtle night
Haunt me with deities I never saw,
I soon mine eyelid’s drowsy curtain draw
To hide their myriad faces from my sight.
They threat in vain; the whirlwind cannot awe
A happy snow-flake dancing in the flaw.","There may be chaos still around the world, this little world that in my thinking lies.For mine own bosom is the paradise where all my life's fair visions are unfurled.Within my nature’s shell I slumber curled, unaware of the changing outer skies, where now, perchance, some new-born Eros flies.","There May Be Chaos Still Around The World' by George Santayana describes a speaker who has escaped the world at large and is only existing within his own mind. The poem begins with the narrator clearly stating that even if there is chaos in the world, his own “little world” is where he focuses. His “thinking lies” there. Within this world he has created, he has a paradise where all of his dreams are realized. The speaker continues to describe how he lives within a shell and can escape there, like a turtle or hermit crab, when he is in danger. Even if regimes rose, fell, and rose again, he would not notice. Nothing phases him or takes away from his peace. Additionally, he states that even if deities singled him out, haunting him in the night, he would just close his eyes and go back into his mind. The poem concludes with the speaker once more reiterating that none of the things previously mentioned can harm him, and comparing himself to a snow-flake that is unmoved and unafraid of the “whirlwind” around him.

857,"Creation fires my tongue!
Nature thy anthems raise;
And spread the universal song
Of thy Creator's praise!

Heaven's chief delight was Man
Before Creation's birth--
Ordained with joy to lead the van,
And reign the lord of earth.

When Sin was quite unknown,
And all the woes it brought,
He hailed the morn without a groan
Or one corroding thought.

When each revolving wheel
Assumed its sphere sublime,
Submissive Earth then heard the peal,
And struck the march of time.

The march in Heaven begun,
And splendor filled the skies,
When Wisdom bade the morning Sun
With joy from chaos rise.

The angels heard the tune
Throughout creation ring:
They seized their golden harps as soon
And touched on every string.

When time and space were young,
And music rolled along--
The morning stars together sung,
And Heaven was drown'd in song.

Ye towering eagles soar,
And fan Creation's blaze,
And ye terrific lion's roar,
To your Creator's praise.

Responsive thunders roll,
Loud acclamations sound,
And show your Maker's vast control
O'er all the worlds around.

Stupendous mountains smoke,
And lift your summits high,
To him who all your terrors woke,
Dark'ning the sapphire sky.

Now let my muse descend,
To view the march below--

And bid your chorus flow.

Ye vast volcanoes yell,
Whence fiery cliffs are hurled;
And all ye liquid oceans swell
Beneath the solid world.

Ye cataracts combine,
Nor let the pæan cease--
The universal concert join,
Thou dismal precipice.

There are lots of biblical references in particular to the fall of man. It begins by exulting god and praising the effects of creation. Though splattered throughout are warning flags about the fate of our planet. Around the tenth stanza, the mood of the poem changes and I think this represents the fall of man. This could be a euphemism for slavery, however. The final stanza acts almost as a mirror image to the first stanza which gives the poem symmetry."
858,"Laugh, and the world laughs with you;
Weep, and you weep alone;

The poem begins with the speaker making five statements regarding how the “world” will react depending on whether you “Laugh” or “Weep.” Someone who is happy and upbeat is going to attract friends while someone who “Sigh[s]” and weeps will not. Through the next two stanza, the speaker tries to make clear that one should do whatever possible to maintain a happy life surrounded by those who increase that happiness. Sadness will breed nothing but solitude. The poem concludes with the speaker adding that pain and death happen to everyone, but they will always be faced alone."

860,"As when above parched fields the compassionate

The traveller listens, and remembers the bright
Locks of his love, nor knows the hour is late.

Lifts from the grave her gaze to the shining skies,
And that still whiteness calms her misery.

And through the mighty trees the fresh breeze sighs,
Such, O divinest poet, such thy verse to me.","As when above parched fields the compassionateMoon suspended, floods the summer dew with light,                Murmurs the flowing stream, the ripples scintillate,                Reflecting as they run the radiance white.                The unseen nightingale hid ‘mid the leaves of night.                Fills the vast calm with melodies passionate,                .","'Virgil' uses nature imagery to evoke historical and mythical themes and events. The title is a reference to an epic poet who wrote his masterpiece, the Aeneid, in Latin around 20 BCE. The Aeneid is the story of the journey of the hero Aeneas from the fallen walls of Troy to the seven hills of Rome. It is a foundational myth for Rome like the myth of the twins Romulus and Remus suckled by the she-wolf. “Virgil” is also steeped in the fall of Troy without even once alluding to it."
861,"I am not a painter, I am a poet.
Why? I think I would rather be
a painter, but I am not. Well,

for instance, Mike Goldberg
is starting a painting. I drop in.
“Sit down and have a drink” he
says. I drink; we drink. I look
up. “You have SARDINES in it.”
“Yes, it needed something there.”
“Oh.” I go and the days go by
and I drop in again. The painting
is going on, and I go, and the days
go by. I drop in. The painting is
finished. “Where’s SARDINES?”
All that’s left is just
letters, “It was too much,” Mike says.

But me? One day I am thinking of
a color: orange. I write a line
about orange. Pretty soon it is a
whole page of words, not lines.
Then another page. There should be
so much more, not of orange, of
words, of how terrible orange is
and life. Days go by. It is even in
prose, I am a real poet. My poem
is finished and I haven’t mentioned
orange yet. It’s twelve poems, I call
it ORANGES. And one day in a gallery
I see Mike’s painting, called SARDINES.","I am not a painter, I am a poet. One day I am thinking of a color: orange. I write a line about orange. Pretty soon it is a whole page of words, not lines. There should be so much more, not of orange, of how terrible orange is.","'Why I Am Not a Painter' by Frank O'Hara is a narrative poem taken from the poet's own life experiences. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker, O'Hara himself, notes how he would like to be a painter, but he's a poet. He goes on to describe visiting Michael Goldberg's studio and watching him add sardines to a painting. When he visits later, they're gone. O'Hara presents this as a contrast to his own work. He writes about oranges, never mentioning oranges themselves. Although the poem initially sought to express the differences between the two ways of creating, in the end, they feel more similar than they are different."

This is the birth of life and of love and wings.","'i thank You God for most this amazing' by E.E. Cummings is a prayer of thanks directed at God regarding his creation of the world. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker begins by thanking God for “this amazing / day.” They feel reinvigorated in their appreciation of the natural world and use the fourteen lines of this poem to express that in the form of a prayer. They feel as though they died and are “alive again today” and can feel the beauty of “life,” “love,” “wings,” and “of the gay / great happening illimitably earth.” The speaker concludes the poem by acknowledging that some human beings doubt God's existence. They are people who have not had the same spiritual awakening that the speaker has. Their eyes and ears are not awake."
863,"All night long I hear the sleepers toss
Between the darkened window and the wall.
The madman’s whimper and the lover’s voice,
The worker’s whisper and the sick child’s call—
Knowing them all

I’d walk a mile, maybe, hearing some cat
Crying its guts out, to throttle it by hand,
Such simple love I had. I wished I might—
Or God might—answer each call in person and
Each poor demand.

But love without direction is a cheap blanket

No one is warm.",All night long I hear the sleepers toss                Between the darkened window and the wall.

But love without direction is a cheap blanket                No one is warm.,"Such Simple Love' by Thomas McGrath suggests that love without intention is not worth living. Alongside this, he argues that everyone deserves comfort and happiness. From these two statements, it can be assumed that McGrath believes everyone should find love and joy. It is better to actually take action, rather than just thinking about doing something. The poet moves through the slumbering building in his mind, taking stock of all the people sleeping. He understands their individual pains, hoping to help alleviate them. McGrath knows that he would go to the ends of the earth in order to let them all sleep peacefully. The final stanza states that he should go to sleep himself, these 'fancies' not actually doing anything. He realizes that he can fantasize about helping people all he wants, the fact is he doesn't do anything and doesn't change the lives of these people."
864,"I often wish I were a King,
And then I could do anything.

If only I were King of Spain,
I'd take my hat off in the rain.

I wouldn't brush my hair for aunts.

The poem begins with the speaker telling the reader that he thinks a lot about what it's like to be a king. He goes through a number of different countries and activities he'd like to participate, or not participate, in. These include keeping wild animals, like elephants, not wearing his hat or brushing his hair, and thinking of “lovely things to do.” He shows his desire to gain some control over his life and those around him. The child speaker feels as if the rules imposed on him are unfair and would like to get rid of them. The funny, yet poignant, desires of the speaker are widely relatable to any child reading the text, making this piece a great example of children's poetry."
865,"Tonight I have taken all that I was

Fairburn is a strikingly memorable poem about a speaker's transformation from youth to adulthood. The speaker uses violent language throughout this piece to depict the process of killing his younger self. He chokes the young man he used to be, digs out his brains, and makes sure that unlike Christ, he won't rise again on the third day. The speaker clearly feels as though the presence of this young man in his mind is doing him more harm than good. But, it's hard to imagine that this is truly the case by the time a reader concludes the piece."
866,"Thou Winter, thou art keen, intensely keen;
Thy cutting frowns experience bids me know,
For in thy weather days and days I've been,
As grinning north-winds horribly did blow,
And pepper'd round my head their hail and snow:
Throughout thy reign 'tis mine each year to prove thee;
And, spite of every storm I've beetled in,
With all thy insults, Winter, I do love thee,
Thou half enchantress, like to pictur'd Sin!
Though many frowns thy sparing smiles deform,
Yet when thy sunbeam shrinketh from its shroud,
And thy bright rainbow gilds the purple storm,

Can see thee, Winter, then, and not be warm'd with praise, and say, ""I love thee well!""","Winter Rainbow' by John Clare is a reverential poem that speaks on the charming aspects of the winter season, as well as its “insults”. The poem takes the reader through a speaker's opinion of “Winter”. Clare uses personification to speak more clearly on the power of winter to make people frown with its “grinning north-winds”. There are horrible moments in every winter season but there are also wonderful ones. The speaker says that he can't help but love winter for the moments that the clouds part and a sunbeam comes down, creating a winter rainbow. He is always enchanted by this sight, connecting back to an accumulation of witch/magic related images and language used to describe winter throughout the poem."
867,"O Western Wind when wilt thou blow

My love was in the arms of the man I love, and I was in bed with the man who I love.","'Western Wind' is a short poem that scholars believe originated in the 1500s or earlier. It is addressed to the “western wind.” In the first lines of the poem, the speaker addresses the “western wind.” They ask the wind when it is going to bring the rain down before transitioning into a reference to their “love” and desire to have them in their bed “again.” Although this piece is quite short and fairly simple (at least in its modern form) it is still quite effective. The speaker is longing for his lover comes through quite clearly and is likely to be highly relatable."
868,"Timing’s everything. The vapor rises
high in the sky, tossing to and fro,
then freezes, suddenly, and crystalizes
into a perfect flake of miraculous snow.
For countless miles, drifting east above
the world, whirling about in a swirling free-
for-all, appearing aimless, just like love,
but sensing, seeking out, its destiny.
Falling to where the two young skaters stand,
hand in hand, then flips and dips and whips

Each moment has its own significance. Be it the first kiss of lovers or the tiny little flake's coincidental landing on the lover's lips. Everything depends on chance. Baer's poem is all about chances and timings. In this poem, timing or the moment is an important element from the very beginning. Baer depicts how a snowflake is formed, carried away by the turbulent winter wind, and its gentle landing on a girl's lips. Somehow the flake becomes meaningful in someone's life. Else it would be lost in the great snow cover stretching beneath the lovers' feet."

'Acrostic: Georgiana Augusta Keats' by John Keats is a poem describing the role of verse as an expression of a poet's true feelings towards someone. Here the poet is dedicated to the poet's sister-in-law Georgiana Augusta Keats. She was the wife of his brother George Keats. The couple assisted the ailing poet while he began a walking tour in 1818. The poet presents his thankfulness to her for staying by his side. He seeks inspiration from the Greek God of poetry, Apollo, and the nine muses to assist him to write a verse that can present his true emotions to her. In the end, the poet wishes Georgiana for a better future with his husband George. And refers to his poem as a reminder of the love that will keep the poet, John Keats alive in their happily married life."
870,"My Love is like to ice, and I to fire:
How comes it then that this her cold so great
Is not dissolved through my so hot desire,
But harder grows the more I her entreat?
Or how comes it that my exceeding heat
Is not allayed by her heart-frozen cold,
But that I burn much more in boiling sweat,
And feel my flames augmented manifold?
What more miraculous thing may be told,
That fire, which all things melts, should harden ice,
And ice, which is congeal’d with senseless cold,
Should kindle fire by wonderful device?

That it can alter all the course of kind.","My Love is like to ice, and I to fire: how comes it then that this her cold so great is not dissolved through my so hot desire, but harder grows the more I her entreat? Such is the power of love in gentle mind, that it can alter all the course of kind.","My Love is like to ice, and I to fire' by Edmund Spenser describes the contradictory but also complementary personalities of the speaker and his lover. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is like fire and his lover is like ice. Although they are different from one another their love is strong. It becomes clear as the poem progresses that it is due to their differences that their love succeeds. The first three sets of four lines contain questions the speaker, Spenser himself, poses to the reader. These are not meant to be answered. Instead, they are included to emphasize the “miraculous” nature of the relationship. The woman's ice is not melted by his fire, nor is his fire “allayed” by her cold. The poem concludes with a couplet that answers all of the speaker's questions. It is love that has given their relationship the power it needs to succeed. Love has the ability to overcome all types and kinds."
871,"If the meaning of the prayer was not passed down to you,
find it through holier means than translation.
Cling to the rhythm instead.
If you were not taught the rhythm, memorize the clang

then the Bombay jazz club

with their memories
indented in thick amber,
the gold Zarathustra hanging from a neck
and tattooed on a sunburnt back.

The tea bags brought from India will do.
The reusable garland will do.

show a compass of 3 directions.
The fourth will do, too.
With its back facing you,
and its open jaws the homeland.
If the orthodox genealogy did not show up to the altar
of any of the son’s weddings, identity will celebrate
the melting pot mothers. Inheritance
blooms a grateful garland
around the brownish baby’s plump smile.
Her laughter, an anthem.

It also refers to the dispersion of the Jews in the Age of Christ's Twelve Apostles. In relation to the present poem, the title also means the dispersion of the Jews and their emigration to other countries, from Germany and the countries occupied by her during World War II (1939-45). In a gloomy mood, Auden writes that the Jews have never reconciled themselves to the survival of Christianity after Christ's crucifixion. They persecuted him like anything. They pursued him to the cross. Thereafter they vilified his system of religion and ridiculed his Heaven as a land of mirages. Their sin has ultimately recoiled upon themselves. The Nazi Germans are persecuting the Jews as if to punish them for the sin committed by their ancient ancestors about two thousand years ago. The Jews of the early Christian centuries could never understand how Jesus Christ and his system of religion could survive his persecution and crucifixion. Their ancestors had beggared him, pursued him to the Cross, and had him crucified. Their intolerance proved that they loved their God called Jehovah, their Jewish religion, and their land Israel more than their lives. Their God had commanded them to love and worship only it, with all their heart and in all places. Hence they attempted to drive Christ and his faith not only out of the bounds of the earth but also out of the bounds of their heaven. Yet Christ completed his mission of the prophet for which he was born. But his persecutors were filled with envy at his religion of the Cross, too. They vilified his system of religion to the last degree. They represented his Heaven as a land of mirages. And now in the present age, their sin of persecuting Christ has again recoiled upon the heads of their children. The Nazi Germans are persecuting the human body of the Jews, and causing the diaspora as if to punish them for the sin of Christ's persecution committed by their ancient ancestors about two thousand years ago. In the present sonnet, Auden has employed 'he,' 'his,' and 'him' for Jesus Christ, and 'they,' 'them,' and 'their' for the Jews. In the last line, 'they' has been used to refer to the Nazi German. Auden has adopted this device to avoid falling into any religious controversy."
872,"It is in the small things we see it.
The child's first step,
as awesome as an earthquake.
The first time you rode a bike,
wallowing up the sidewalk.
The first spanking when your heart
went on a journey all alone.
When they called you crybaby
or poor or fatty or crazy
and made you into an alien,
you drank their acid
and concealed it.

Later,
if you faced the death of bombs and bullets
you did not do it with a banner,
you did it with only a hat to
comver your heart.
You did not fondle the weakness inside you
though it was there.
Your courage was a small coal
that you kept swallowing.
If your buddy saved you
and died himself in so doing,
then his courage was not courage,
it was love; love as simple as shaving soap.

if you have endured a great despair,
then you did it alone,
getting a transfusion from the fire,
picking the scabs off your heart,
then wringing it out like a sock.
Next, my kinsman, you powdered your sorrow,
you gave it a back rub
and then you covered it with a blanket
and after it had slept a while
it woke to the wings of the roses
and was transformed.

Later,
when you face old age and its natural conclusion
your courage will still be shown in the little ways,
each spring will be a sword you'll sharpen,
those you love will live in a fever of love,
and you'll bargain with the calendar
and at the last moment
when death opens the back door
you'll put on your carpet slippers
and stride out.","It is in the small things we see it that courage is revealed. The first time you rode a bike, the first spanking when your heart went on a journey all alone.

For instance, the first stanza discusses childhood; the second stanza describes the scenes from young adulthood; the third stanza contends with middle age; the final stanza discusses old age. The speaker of the poem gives examples of instances in each life stage where a person may have to show courage. Through her use of imagery, Sexton paints a rich picture for her reader."

Upon entering the house she sees her “hound” on the floor. She bends to speak with him and he does not raise his head or make a sound. She realizes that he is dead. The next person she comes across is her father. The speaker touches him, but he doesn't react. It has been so long since she was home that he does not recognize, or even hear her voice. Finally, she calls out for her mother but she does not turn her head. In the final lines the speaker flees from the house, her worst fears confirmed. She has been gone so long, and changed so much, that no one knows her."

The poem begins with the speaker telling the listener of his crime. He ate “the plums,” a very specific group of them, from the fridge. These fruits were important to the listener because they were going to have them for breakfast. This is a fact the speaker was aware of but chose to disregard. When he saw them and thought about what they'd taste like, he couldn't resist. The final lines contain his apology to his listener for his actions and the reasoning behind this little betrayal."

so sweetly she couldn't remember her troubles,and

and molly was chased by a horrible thing
which raced sideways while blowing bubbles:and

And molly was chased by a horrible thing which raced sideways while blowing bubbles:and may came home with a smooth round stone.,"'maggie and milly and molly and may' by E. E. Cummings is a short poem that briefly touches on the spectrum of emotional experiences. Through four young girls, the poet explores happiness, comfort, friendship, fear, and reflection. “maggie and milly and molly and may” are at the beach having quite different experiences. One listens to music in a seashell, another finds a starfish, one experiences fear while being chased by a crab, and the final reflect on loneliness and the broader world. As a conclusion, the speaker notes how important the seashore is, and what one can find there."
878,"Thirteen’s no age at all. Thirteen is nothing.
It is not wit, or powder on the face,
Or Wednesday matinees, or misses’ clothing,
Or intellect, or grace,
Twelve has its tribal customs. But thirteen
Is neither boys in battered cars nor dolls,
Not Sara Crewe or movie magazine,
Or pennants on the walls.

Thirteen keeps diaries and tropical fish
(A month, at most); scorns jump-ropes in the spring;
Could not, would fortune grant it, name its wish;
Wants nothing, everything;
Has secrets from itself, friends it despises;
Admits none of the terrors it feels;
Owns half a hundred masks but no disguises;
And walks upon its heels.

Thirteen’s anomalous – not that, not this:
Not folded bud, or wave that laps a shore,
Or moth proverbial from the chrysalis.
Is the one age defeats the metaphor.
Is not a town, like childhood, strongly walled
But easily surrounded; is no city.
Nor, quitted once, can it be quite recalled –
Not even with pity.","Thirteen’s no age at all. Thirteen is nothing. It is not wit, or powder on the face, or Wednesday matinees, or misses’ clothing, or intellect, or grace. It has secrets from itself, friends it despises, and admits none of the terrors it feels.","'Portrait of Girl with Comic Book' by Phyllis McGinley is an interesting poem that addresses what happens when someone turns thirteen. The speaker is considering what it's like to move from twelve to thirteen, especially for girls. It's not a time for toys, nor is it a time for boys. There is no intellect, grace, or wit. It's uncomfortable and hard to adjust to. Someone who is thirteen is going to struggle to fit in and know what they're supposed to do or like."
879,"Often I had gone this way before:
But now it seemed I never could be
And never had been anywhere else;
'Twas home; one nationality
We had, I and the birds that sang,
One memory.
 
They welcomed me. I had come back
That eve somehow from somewhere far:
The April mist, the chill, the calm,
Meant the same thing familiar
And pleasant to us, and strange too,
Yet with no bar.
 
The thrush on the oaktop in the lane
Sang his last song, or last but one;
And as he ended, on the elm
Another had but just begun
His last; they knew no more than I
The day was done.
 
Then past his dark white cottage front
A labourer went along, his tread
Slow, half with weariness, half with ease;
And, through the silence, from his shed
The sound of sawing rounded all
That silence said.","The April mist, the chill, the calm,                Meant the same thing familiar and pleasant to us, and strange too, yet with no bar.

Nature seems beautiful and endless, humans are comfortable and at peace. Home is somewhere special to Thomas, with even the silence being a force of comfort. He remarks how everything seems so much more familiar when at home, even the seasons taking on a different form."

I didn't want them to be ghosts. I wanted to be them. I want to be me.","'Origin of the Marble Forest' by Gregory Orr is a short, compelling poem about a speaker's relationship to people in his past. The poem is only five lines long, but it is quite effective. In it, the speaker spends the lines having a discussion with someone, perhaps themselves, about their past and the people who were a part of it. They say that people are “bodies” dotting their past. By using “bodies,” they're distancing themselves from these people while also suggesting something about the nature of their relationship. They are told to “let go” of them, but the speaker wants them to remain, as stone, creating the “marble forest” referenced in the title."
881,"Let the world's sharpness, like a clasping knife,
Shut in upon itself and do no harm
In this close hand of Love, now soft and warm,
And let us hear no sound of human strife
After the click of the shutting. Life to life—
I lean upon thee, Dear, without alarm,
And feel as safe as guarded by a charm
Against the stab of worldlings, who if rife
Are weak to injure. Very whitely still
The lilies of our lives may reassure
Their blossoms from their roots, accessible
Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer,
Growing straight, out of man's reach, on the hill.
God only, who made us rich, can make us poor.","Let the world's sharpness, like a clasping knife, shut in upon itself and do no harm. God only, who made us rich, can make us poor. The lilies of our lives may reassure                Their blossoms from their roots, accessible                Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer than fewer.","“Let the world's sharpness” by Elizabeth Barrett Browning is a Petrarchan sonnet that proposes a resolution to the world's strife— all turn to, and accept, Love. The poem begins with the speaker comparing the end of the world's problems with the action of closing a “clasping knife.” The blade, or the terrors of the world, is now out of reach and cannot do harm to anyone. The hand that closed this knife belongs to Love. Or as later made clear, the hand of God's love. The speaker of this piece then turns to a companion, who is to her an embodiment of all that God's love can do, and speaks of her trust and faith in this person. She believes she will be guarded against the “worldlings.” Those who would seek to do other's harm for their own benefit. The poem concludes with the speaker promoting the love that God fosters and the strength he has to control life and death. No man will be able to change the world in the way that God's love is able to."
882,"It takes much time to kill a tree,

Not a simple jab of the knife

Will do it. It has grown
Slowly consuming the earth,
Rising out of it, feeding
Upon its crust, absorbing
Years of sunlight, air, water,
And out of its leperous hide
Sprouting leaves.

So hack and chop
But this alone wont do it.
Not so much pain will do it.
The bleeding bark will heal
And from close to the ground
Will rise curled green twigs,
Miniature boughs
Which if unchecked will expand again
To former size.

No,
The root is to be pulled out -
Out of the anchoring earth;
It is to be roped, tied,
And pulled out - snapped out
Or pulled out entirely,
Out from the earth-cave,
And the strength of the tree exposed,
The source, white and wet,
The most sensitive, hidden
For years inside the earth.

Then the matter
Of scorching and choking
In sun and air,
Browning, hardening,
Twisting, withering,
And then it is done.","It takes much time to kill a tree. Not a simple jab of the knife will do it. The root is to be pulled out. The bleeding bark will heal. And from close to the ground, curled green twigs will rise. If unchecked, they will expand back to former size.","‘On Killing a Tree’ by Gieve Patel depicts a series of qualities in varying manners, including resilience, selfishness, arrogance, growth, and nurturing. These concepts are presented in various lights, all with the idea of the “tree” as a driving force. This “tree,” though it begins as something to be admired for its “strength,” changes in circumstance to become something worth pity since it ends while what it used and took for granted continues around it. In this, we can learn the value of resilience through this poem, but also see a warning of what can happen when we let purely self-driven resilience remain our sole focus."
883,"Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night
Sailed off in a wooden shoe,—
Sailed on a river of crystal light
Into a sea of dew.
""Where are you going, and what do you wish?""
The old moon asked the three.
""We have come to fish for the herring-fish
That live in this beautiful sea;
Nets of silver and gold have we,""
Said Wynken,
Blynken,
And Nod.
The old moon laughed and sang a song,
As they rocked in the wooden shoe;
And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew;
The little stars were the herring-fish
That lived in the beautiful sea.
""Now cast your nets wherever you wish,—
Never afraid are we!""
So cried the stars to the fishermen three,
Wynken,
Blynken,
And Nod.
All night long their nets they threw
To the stars in the twinkling foam,—
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe,
Bringing the fishermen home:
'Twas all so pretty a sail, it seemed
As if it could not be;
And some folk thought 'twas a dream they'd dreamed
Of sailing that beautiful sea;
But I shall name you the fishermen three:
Wynken,
Blynken,
And Nod.
Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,
And Nod is a little head,
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee one's trundle-bed;
So shut your eyes while Mother sings
Of wonderful sights that be,
And you shall see the beautiful things
As you rock in the misty sea
Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three:—
Wynken,
Blynken,
And Nod.","Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night sailed off in a wooden shoe. The old moon laughed and sang a song as they rocked in the boat. The fishermen threw their nets all night long to the stars in the twinkling foam. Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe, bringing the fishermen home.","The poem, 'Wynken, Blynken, and Nod' by Eugene Field, describes three little kids who are sailing in the sky on a wooden shoe and catch stars as herring fish. This poem presents three little kids, Wynken, Blynken, and Nod. One night, they sailed off in a wooden boat for fishing in the night sky. The stars in the sky appeared to them as herring fish and they wanted to catch them with their golden and silver nets. When they came closer to the old moon, it asked what they were doing there. They replied that they were sailing in the sky to catch the stars. Hearing that, the moon sang a song that ruffled the sky. It was hard for the children to catch the stars. At last, the little fishermen returned from their venture with what they had caught. In the last stanza, Field makes it clear that it is a fantasy story. Wynken and Blynken are nothing other than the eyes of a little child. His head is “Nod.” So, it was a dream that the child was seeing in his dream. His little bed became the wooden shoe-boat in his imagination."
884,"Give to me the life I love,
Let the lave go by me,
Give the jolly heaven above
And the byway night me.

There's the life for ever.

And the road below me.

Biting the blue finger;
White as meal the frosty field --
Warm the fireside haven --

Not to winter even!

The poem starts with the speaker asking someone, likely God, to allow him to live a life that he loves. He wants to be free and walk on the solid road, with the sky above him. He's uninterested in the things that inspire most men and women, such as wealth or love. He just wants to see the world around him and be undeterred by rules, weather, or any other restriction on his movements."
885,"Why should I let the toad work
Squat on my life?
Can't I use my wit as a pitchfork
And drive the brute off?

Six days of the week it soils
With its sickening poison -
Just for paying a few bills!
That's out of proportion.

Lots of folk live on their wits:
Lecturers, lispers,
Losers, loblolly-men, louts-
They don't end as paupers;

Lots of folk live up lanes
With fires in a bucket,
Eat windfalls and tinned sardines-
They seem to like it.

Their nippers have got bare feet,
Their unspeakable wives
Are skinny as whippets - and yet
No one actually _starves_.

Ah, were I courageous enough
To shout, Stuff your pension!
But I know, all too well, that's the stuff
That dreams are made on:

For something sufficiently toad-like
Squats in me, too;
Its hunkers are heavy as hard luck,
And cold as snow,

And will never allow me to blarney
My way of getting
The fame and the girl and the money
All at one sitting.

I don't say, one bodies the other
One's spiritual truth;
But I do say it's hard to lose either,
When you have both.","Why should I let the toad work? Can't I use my wit as a pitchfork and drive the brute off? Six days of the week it soils my bank account - just for paying a few bills!

The poem begins with the speaker describing how there is one thing that plagues him more than anything else: a toad. This toad represents work, exterior obligations, and financial pressures. It is always there, forcing poison into his life. Larkin’s speaker is curious about what his life would be like and if he’d be happier if he were poor. The next stanzas depict the lives of the poorest, those who struggle to find food and shelter. Although Larkin realizes the struggles of a jobless life, he thinks these people are happier than he is. Plus, he states, no one ever actually seems to starve to death. In the next section of ‘Toad,’ the speaker admits that he is never actually going to make this shift. He is not brave enough to throw off the pensions given to him by the government. This is due mostly to a second toad. This one is present within his body and forces him to keep his job. The combination of these two toads is the entire reason he is unable to change."
886,"Nothing is plumb, level, or square:

it screamed and went on through,
skewing as wrong the other way.

Throughout the poem, the speaker compares his own life to that of a house that is “shaky by nature.” He describes building the house, how he made it the way it is, “Nothing…plumb, level, or square.” The speaker gets increasingly angry as the poem continues on, angry at himself and at God, who at one point he blames for his life. The poem concludes with a reference to martyrdom in which the speaker confesses that he is determined to stay in this rickety house until it kills him. He will nail his left hand to the wall, but needs a wife, “a love,” to nail the right hand. The wife can be seen as a positive in the speaker’s life, but also as the reason his life is the way it is.

887,"Isn’t it strange
That princes and kings,
And clowns that caper
In sawdust rings,
And common people
Like you and me
Are builders for eternity?

A shapeless mass,
A book of rules;
And each must make-
Ere life is flown-
A stumbling block
Or a stepping stone.","Isn’t it strange that princes and kings, and clowns that caper in sawdust rings, and common people like you and me are builders for eternity?

Sharpe depicts human choice and decision making through a “shapeless mass” and “bag of tools”. The poem begins with the speaker asking the listener, a generalized representative of all human beings, if they also think it's strange that “clowns” and “kings” all have the same life to live. No matter who you are or the circumstances of your birth, the days of your life, there is a finite amount of time. This period gives everyone the opportunity to shape a “mass” and use their “bag of tools” to craft a life for themselves."
888,"Bulkeley, Hunt, Willard, Hosmer, Meriam, Flint,
Possessed the land which rendered to their toil
Hay, corn, roots, hemp, flax, apples, wool, and wood.
Each of these landlords walked amidst his farm,
Saying, “’Tis mine, my children’s and my name’s.
How sweet the west wind sounds in my own trees!
How graceful climb those shadows on my hill!
I fancy these pure waters and the flags
Know me, as does my dog: we sympathize;
And, I affirm, my actions smack of the soil.”
Where are these men? Asleep beneath their grounds:
And strangers, fond as they, their furrows plough.
Earth laughs in flowers, to see her boastful boys
Earth-proud, proud of the earth which is not theirs;
Who steer the plough, but cannot steer their feet
Clear of the grave.
They added ridge to valley, brook to pond,
And sighed for all that bounded their domain;
“This suits me for a pasture; that’s my park;
We must have clay, lime, gravel, granite-ledge,
And misty lowland, where to go for peat.
The land is well,—lies fairly to the south.
’Tis good, when you have crossed the sea and back,
To find the sitfast acres where you left them.”

Him to his land, a lump of mould the more.

Who so controlled me;

But they are unaware of their mortality. In the second section, the “Earth-Song”, the poet shares what earth thinks about those men. Earth is rather in a sarcastic mood about their foolishness. In the last section, the poetic persona shares his reaction after hearing the story of those men and the song of the earth. In that last stanza, it is the poet who presents his realization."

890,"My parents kept me from children who were rough
Who threw words like stones and wore torn clothes
Their thighs showed through rags they ran in the street
And climbed cliffs and stripped by the country streams.

I feared more than tigers their muscles like iron
Their jerking hands and their knees tight on my arms
I feared the salt coarse pointing of those boys
Who copied my lisp behind me on the road.

Like dogs to bark at my world. They threw mud
While I looked the other way, pretending to smile.

Spender describes bullies and the feeling of being bullied throughout the poem. He elaborates on his feelings using the poetic devices of Enjambment, Imagery, and Similes. ‘My Parents’ is in the first person and in an ambiguous point of view. However, we can assume that Spender was mentioning his own direct feeling’s in this poem, so it was in his own point of view. Interestingly enough, Spender has entitled his poem ‘My Parents’ despite the fact that the entire poem centers around bullying. The only thing Spender mentions about his parents is that they kept him away from these sinister boys who used to tease him. The fact that Spender named the poem ‘My Parents’ shows that he has a great appreciation for how they protected him, or perhaps it shows that he blames his parents for being the children’s target, for they did not allow him to befriend them."

892,"I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contain'd,
I stand and look at them long and long.

They do not sweat and whine about their condition,
They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,
They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,
Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning things,
Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago,
Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.

So they show their relations to me and I accept them,
They bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their possession.

I wonder where they get those tokens,
Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?

Gathering and showing more always and with velocity,
Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,
Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,
Picking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly terms.

Head high in the forehead, wide between the ears,
Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,
Eyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving.

His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,
His well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return.

For a whole fortnight,
And withered for lack of watering
To a skeleton mere — a mummied thing.

But it was not much, mid a world of teen,
That a flower should waste in a nook unseen!

One needed no thought to ascertain
How it happened; that when she went in the rain
To return here not,
She was mindless what
She had left here to perish. — Ah, well: for an hour
I wished I had not found the flower!

Yet it was not much. And she never had known
Of the flower's fate; nor it of her own.","In the bedchamber window, near the glass, stood the little flower in the little vase. For a whole fortnight, the flower withered for lack of watering. It was not much, mid a world of teen,                That a flower should waste in a nook unseen!","‘The Flower’s Tragedy’ by Thomas Hardy describes the fate of a flower that was left to die without water when its owner went to her own death. The poem begins with the speaker describing the setting in which they found the flower. It was stuck in a nook, alone, in the bedchamber of a woman who had died. It had been alone for two weeks and was more a skeleton than a flower at that point. The flower appeared “mummied” as it was so waterless. As the poem continues on the reader’s sympathy for the flower grows. Even with the addition of a few details about the woman’s death, it is impossible not to feel worse for the flower and its “tragedy.” The poem concludes with this speaker wishing that they had never found the flower in the first place. Now, in a way, they must carry the weight of the flower’s terrible end."
895,"I don’t want them to turn
my little girl into a swallow.
She would fly far away into the sky
and never fly again to my straw bed,
or she would nest in the eaves
where I could not comb her hair.
I don’t want them to turn
my little girl into a swallow.
I don’t want them to make
my little girl a princess. In tiny golden slippers
how could she play on the meadow?
And when night came, no longer
would she sleep at my side.
I don’t want them to make
my little girl a princess.
And even less do I want them
one day to make her queen.
They would put her on a throne
where I could not go to see her.
And when night time came
I could never rock her …
I don’t want them to make
my little girl a queen!","I don’t want them to turn my little girl into a swallow,’ writes author. ‘They would put her on a throne where I could not go to see her.’ ‘And when night time came, no longer would she sleep at my side’","'Fear' by Gabriela Mistral is a poem about a mother's desires for her daughter's future. In the first stanza of the poem, the poet uses an extended metaphor to describe a mother's worry about her daughter's future. She does not want “them” to turn her daughter into a swallow. Her assertions continue in the next two stanzas as she declares her hope that her daughter will never become a “princess” or a “queen.” Any of these outcomes would take her daughter away from her, and she would become a different person."
896,"Much have I spoken of the faded leaf;
Long have I listened to the wailing wind,
And watched it ploughing through the heavy clouds,
For autumn charms my melancholy mind.
When autumn comes, the poets sing a dirge:
The year must perish; all the flowers are dead;
The sheaves are gathered; and the mottled quail
Runs in the stubble, but the lark has fled!
Still, autumn ushers in the Christmas cheer,
The holly-berries and the ivy-tree:
They weave a chaplet for the Old Year’s bier,
These waiting mourners do not sing for me!
I find sweet peace in depths of autumn woods,
Where grow the ragged ferns and roughened moss;
The naked, silent trees have taught me this,—
The loss of beauty is not always loss!","Much have I spoken of the faded leaf; long have I listened to the wailing wind,                And watched it ploughing through the heavy clouds,                For autumn charms my melancholy mind.                When autumn comes, the poets sing a dirge: the year must perish; all the flowers are dead.                Still, autumn ushers in the Christmas cheer,                The holly-berries and the ivy-tree: They weave a chaplet for the Old Year’s bier.                These waiting mourners do not sing for me!","'November' by Elizabeth Drew Barstow Stoddard describes the emotions a speaker feels in regards to the coming of autumn. The poem begins with the speaker acknowledging the fact that she speaks often about the “faded leaf.” She is soothed by the “wailing wind” and the colours of autumn. Although it signals the end of the year and the dying off of many flowers, she does not mind. It brings her a kind of peace to see time progress. By the end of the poem, she states she feels this way now because she was once told that a loss of beauty does not mean that something, or a particular time, is not valuable. She learned to love the change which comes when the old year dies."
897,"All around, shards of a lost tradition:
From the Rough Field I went to school
In the Glen of the Hazels. Close by
Was the bishopric of the Golden Stone;
The cairn of Carleton's homesick poem.

Scattered over the hills, tribal-
And placenames, uncultivated pearls.
No rock or ruin, dun or dolmen
But showed memory defying cruelty
Through an image-encrusted name.

The heathery gap where the Rapparee,
Shane Barnagh, saw his brother die -
On a summer's day the dying sun
Stained its colours to crimson:
So breaks the heart, Brish-mo-Cree.

The whole landscape a manuscript
We had lost the skill to read,
A part of our past disinherited;
But fumbled, like a blind man,
Along the fingertips of instinct.

The last Gaelic speaker in the parish
When I stammered my school Irish
One Sunday after mass, crinkled
A rusty litany of praise:
Tá an Ghaeilge againn arís . . .*

Tír Eoghain:Land of Owen,
Province of the O'Niall;
The ghostly tread of O'Hagan's
Barefoot gallowglasses marching
To merge forces in Dun Geanainn

Push southward to Kinsale!
Loudly the war-cry is swallowed
In swirls of black rain and fog
As Ulster's pride, Elizabeth's foemen,
Founder in a Munster bog.
*We have the Irish again.","All around, shards of a lost tradition: From the Rough Field I went to school in the Glen of the Hazels. Close by was the bishopric of the Golden Stone; the cairn of Carleton's homesick poem. The heathery gap where the Rapparee, Shane Barnagh, saw his brother die - so breaks the heart.","A Lost Tradition' deals with the poet's reminiscence of the lost tradition of Ireland. He brings out the ways that prove that a tradition is lost. The first stanza talks about the monuments and buildings being just as shards of the tradition once existed. He further explores that the tribes and the names given to the hills in the old Gaelic language are the other evidence of the tradition that is lost. He adds an incident from his childhood which proves that the language of the people is no more used. In the following stanza, he compares the city to a manuscript and the people to a blind man. Like the blind man depending on his fingertips, they also depend on the borrowed language for they have forgotten their language and their land. The poet concludes by saying that the land which was once prided and protected by the powerful rulers has lost its true identity in the name of republic and civilization."
898,"The brown wrist and hand with its raw knuckles and blue nails
packed with dirt and oil, pause in mid-air, the fingers arched delicately,

and she mimics him, hand held just so, the wrist loose,
then swooping down to the wrong chord.
She lifts her hand and tries again.

Drill collars rumble, hammering the nubbin-posts.
The helper lifts one, turning it slowly,
then lugs it into the lathe’s chuck.

The bit shears the dull iron into new metal, falling
into the steady chant of lathe work,
and the machinist lights a cigarette, holding

in his upturned palms the polonaise he learned at ten,
then later the easiest waltzes,
etudes, impossible counterpoint

like the voice of his daughter he overhears one night
standing in the backyard. She is speaking
to herself but not herself, as in prayer,

the listener is some version of herself,
and the names are pronounced carefully,
self-consciously: Chopin, Mozart,

Scarlatti., . . . these gestures of voice and hands
suspended over the keyboard
that move like the lathe in its turning

toward music, the wind dragging the hoist chain, the ring
of iron on iron in the holding rack.
His daughter speaks to him one night,

but not to him, rather someone created between them,
a listener, there and not there,
a master of lathes, a student of music.","His daughter speaks to him one night, but not to him, rather someone created between them, a listener, there and not there, a master of lathes, a student of music. The listener is some version of herself, and the names are pronounced carefully, self-consciously: Chopin, Mozart, Scarlatti.","'The Machinist, Teaching His Daughter to Play the Piano' is a free verse poem about a lathe operator who connects with his daughter by teaching her to play the piano. The speaker in 'The Machinist, Teaching His Daughter to Play the Piano' is unspecified. Still, they speak as if they are watching two people, the machinist and his daughter, as they are practicing different skills in separate spaces. The speaker describes the machinist's dirty hands in stanza one, emphasizing their roughness and delicate position. Stanza two switches focus to the daughter, who mimics the father's hand positions while learning to play the piano. This contrasts the father and daughter and highlights the similarities between playing the piano and turning metal on a lathe. Stanzas three through five, written in italics, describe the machinist as he loads and powers up the lathe, producing a rumbling, clanging sound. Then, finally, the machinist begins to turn the metal and, meanwhile, lights a cigarette, reflecting on his memories of learning to play the piano. The speaker then shifts perspective back to the daughter, comparing the machinist's cigarette to the daughter's voice, who recites the names of famous composers in the backyard. Then, the speaker compares the sounds and motions of the machinist and the voice and gestures of the daughter, explaining that both people create art in very similar ways. The speaker closes by explaining that “one night,” the daughter speaks to her father, but she is not talking to him. Instead, she is speaking to an invisible listener who exists between them. This listener ties the daughter and her father together, and it stands in for the work that both the machinist and daughter do and the audience of the music they create together."

On the Nong Ning Nang all the mice go Clang and you just can't catch 'em when they do! And the monkeys all say BOO!,"'On The Ning Nang Nong' by Spike Milligan speaks, through nonsense language, on a make-believe world made primarily of noises. The poem begins with the speaker giving the reader a few very strange lines about a place called “The Ning Nang Nong.” There is a great emphasis placed on onomatopoeic language. Within almost every line there is an exclamation of sorts that is meant to surprise and please the reader. As the poem progresses the speaker tells the reader about the noises made by trees, teapots, and mice. The poem concludes with a recognition that the imagined land described in the text is “noisy.”"
900,"There! See the line of lights,
A chain of stars down either side the street --
Why can't you lift the chain and give it to me,
A necklace for my throat? I'd twist it round
And you could play with it. You smile at me
As though I were a little dreamy child
Behind whose eyes the fairies live. . . . And see,
The people on the street look up at us
All envious. We are a king and queen,
Our royal carriage is a motor bus,
We watch our subjects with a haughty joy. . . .
How still you are! Have you been hard at work
And are you tired to-night? It is so long
Since I have seen you -- four whole days, I think.
My heart is crowded full of foolish thoughts
Like early flowers in an April meadow,
And I must give them to you, all of them,
Before they fade. The people I have met,
The play I saw, the trivial, shifting things
That loom too big or shrink too little, shadows
That hurry, gesturing along a wall,
Haunting or gay -- and yet they all grow real
And take their proper size here in my heart
When you have seen them. . . . There's the Plaza now,
A lake of light! To-night it almost seems
That all the lights are gathered in your eyes,
Drawn somehow toward you. See the open park
Lying below us with a million lamps
Scattered in wise disorder like the stars.
We look down on them as God must look down
On constellations floating under Him
Tangled in clouds. . . . Come, then, and let us walk
Since we have reached the park. It is our garden,
All black and blossomless this winter night,
But we bring April with us, you and I;
We set the whole world on the trail of spring.
I think that every path we ever took
Has marked our footprints in mysterious fire,
Delicate gold that only fairies see.
When they wake up at dawn in hollow tree-trunks
And come out on the drowsy park, they look
Along the empty paths and say, ""Oh, here
They went, and here, and here, and here! Come, see,
Here is their bench, take hands and let us dance
About it in a windy ring and make
A circle round it only they can cross
When they come back again!"" . . . Look at the lake --
Do you remember how we watched the swans
That night in late October while they slept?
Swans must have stately dreams, I think. But now
The lake bears only thin reflected lights
That shake a little. How I long to take
One from the cold black water -- new-made gold
To give you in your hand! And see, and see,
There is a star, deep in the lake, a star!
Oh, dimmer than a pearl -- if you stoop down
Your hand could almost reach it up to me. . . .

There was a new frail yellow moon to-night --
I wish you could have had it for a cup
With stars like dew to fill it to the brim. . . .

How cold it is! Even the lights are cold;
They have put shawls of fog around them, see!
What if the air should grow so dimly white
That we would lose our way along the paths
Made new by walls of moving mist receding
The more we follow. . . . What a silver night!
That was our bench the time you said to me
The long new poem -- but how different now,
How eerie with the curtain of the fog
Making it strange to all the friendly trees!
There is no wind, and yet great curving scrolls
Carve themselves, ever changing, in the mist.
Walk on a little, let me stand here watching
To see you, too, grown strange to me and far. . . .
I used to wonder how the park would be
If one night we could have it all alone --
No lovers with close arm-encircled waists
To whisper and break in upon our dreams.
And now we have it! Every wish comes true!
We are alone now in a fleecy world;
Even the stars have gone. We two alone!","The poem was written for a friend of the author's. It was written in the early 1980s. The author says the poem was inspired by his time with his wife. The poem is called ""The Star-Spangled Plaza"" and is written in rhyming couplet form.","A November Night' by Sara Teasdale is a long poem filled with beautiful and haunting images a speaker describes from a walk on a November night. In the first part of 'A November Night,' the speaker begins by excitedly commenting on all the lights she can see around her. There are the stars as well as the lights that border the street and come up from the park. These attract her, and she expresses her feeling that they are drawn to her partner's eyes. Together, they're walking through the night while she stumbles upon memories and shares her thoughts about everything they have seen. As the poem goes on, the darkness of the night expands, and a mist covers the stars that have been looking down upon them. This changes the atmosphere of the poem, and the speaker starts to comment on how cold it is and how strange everything looks in this light. This odd moment in which the two have the park to themselves is one that she's been seeking for a while. Now they have it, and they're alone in the darkness with everything familiar obscured."
901,"A thousand martyrs I have made,
All sacrificed to my desire;
A thousand beauties have betrayed,
That languish in resistless fire.
The untamed heart to hand I brought,
And fixed the wild and wandering thought.
I never vowed nor sighed in vain
But both, though false, were well received.
The fair are pleased to give us pain,
And what they wish is soon believed.
And though I talked of wounds and smart,
Love’s pleasures only touched my heart.
Alone the glory and the spoil
I always laughing bore away;
The triumphs, without pain or toil,
Without the hell, the heav’n of joy.
And while I thus at random rove
Despise the fools that whine for love.","A thousand martyrs I have made, all sacrificed to my desire;                 A thousand beauties have betrayed,                That languish in resistless fire.                 The untamed heart to hand I brought,                And fixed the wild and wandering thought.                 I never vowed nor sighed in vain, but both, though false, were well received.                 Love’s pleasures only touched my heart.                 And though I talked of wounds and smart, smart love, I always laughing bore away.","'A Thousand Martyrs' by Aphra Behn describes the opulent life of a speaker who consumes everyone and everything around her. The poem begins with her stating that she has made “A thousand martyrs” to the cause of her own pleasure. They come to her willingly, and she burns them up until she is tired of them. When these undefined people first came to her they were wild and “wandering” in thought. Her “hand” controlled and changed them. In the second stanza, the speaker states that no move she made was done in “vain.” She did not waste a single word. They were all well “reciev'd” by those who would become her martyrs. In the second half, she explains how the “fair” does not have to wait long for their wishes to be granted. People will do whatever they can to please the most beautiful in society. In the final stanza, she relishes in the fact that she has not had to put out any effort to get what she has. She can carry away her earnings, laughing as she does. There were no pains of hell, only joys of heaven."
902,"My Uncle Giuseppe told me
that in Sicily in World War Two,
in the courtyard behind the aquarium,
where the bougainvillea grows so well,
the only captive mermaid in the world
was butchered on the dry and dusty ground
by a doctor, a fishmonger, and certain others.

She, it, had never learned to speak
because she was simple, or so they’d said,
but the priest who held one of her hands
while her throat was cut,
said she was only a fish, and fish can’t speak.
But she screamed like a woman in terrible fear.

And when they took a ripe golden roe
from her side, the doctor said
this was proof she was just a fish
and anyway an egg is not a child,
but refused when some was offered to him.

Then they put her head and her hands
in a box for burial
and someone tried to take her wedding ring,
but the others stopped him,
and the ring stayed put.

The rest they cooked and fed to the troops.
They said a large fish had been found on the beach.

Starvation forgives men many things,
my uncle, the aquarium keeper, said,
but couldn’t look me in the eye,
for which I thank God.","The only mermaid in the world was killed by a man who thought she was an egg. The man who killed her refused to let her be buried with the rest of the fish. The woman's body was never found, but the man's story has haunted him ever since.","'Giuseppe' by Roderick Ford tells of the moral consequences associated with the violent murder of a mermaid during the Second World War. The poem begins with the speaker setting the scene. There was a group of people in Sicily and in their desperate starved state they butchered a mermaid behind the aquarium. At first, they thought that she was simply a fish and there would be no issue killing her. This was mostly due to the fact that she had never learned to speak. They kill her, and she screams as a woman would scream. This is the first moment they doubt their own actions. All this information comes from a story his uncle used to tell the speaker. He is getting it second hand. As the poem progresses their argument that she was simply a fish gets harder and harder to maintain. She has eggs, but no one will eat them as they seem more like babies than anything else. They bury her head and hands and do not take her “wedding ring.” Eventually, they feed the troops with the rest of her body and tell everyone the meat came from a big fish they found. By the end of the poem it is clear that the uncle felt guilty over the death of this woman, but (mostly) excuses the men's actions because they were starving."
903,"Amid the glare of light and song
And talk that knows not when to cease, The sullen voices of the throng,
My weary soul cries out for peace, Peace and the quietness of death;
The wash of waters deep and cool, The wind too faint for any breath
To stir oblivion’s silent pool,
When all who swim against the stream,
And they that laugh, and they that weep, Shall change like flowers in a dream
That wither on the brows of sleep.
For silence is the song sublime,
And every voice at last must cease, And all the world at evening time
Floats downwards through the gates of peace, Beyond the gloom of shadowy caves
Where water washes on the stones, And breaks with quiet foamless waves
The night’s persistent monotones; The stars are what the flowers seem,
And where the sea of thought is deep, The moonlight glitters like a dream,
On weary waters gone to sleep.","""My weary soul cries out for peace, Peace and the quietness of death"" ""Silence is the song sublime, and every voice at last must cease"" ""The stars are what the flowers seem, The moonlight glitters like a dream, on weary waters gone to sleep"" ""All the world at evening timeFloats downwards through the gates of peace""","Weariness' by Eva Gore-Booth describes a world-weary speaker who is tired of living amongst the constant chatter of her everyday life. It is clear from the first lines that Gore-Booth's speaker wants to escape from her life. Her soul is weary of those around her and the sounds she cannot rid herself of. Everything is loud and constantly present. The majority of the poem is made up of the speaker describing death and the peace she knows she could find there. Death is a place where everyone would become mute. The only sounds present would be the crashing of water on rocks. Her vision would always be full of stars, the sea, and the moonlight on the water. These are all calm and steady sights. She does not believe she could live this kind of life at present."
904,"O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
Alone and palely loitering?
The sedge has withered from the lake,
And no birds sing.
O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
So haggard and so woe-begone?
The squirrel’s granary is full,
And the harvest’s done.
I see a lily on thy brow,
With anguish moist and fever-dew,
And on thy cheeks a fading rose
Fast withereth too.
I met a lady in the meads,
Full beautiful—a faery’s child,
Her hair was long, her foot was light,
And her eyes were wild.
I made a garland for her head,
And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;
She looked at me as she did love,
And made sweet moan
I set her on my pacing steed,
And nothing else saw all day long,
For sidelong would she bend, and sing
A faery’s song.
She found me roots of relish sweet,
And honey wild, and manna-dew,
And sure in language strange she said—
‘I love thee true’.
She took me to her Elfin grot,
And there she wept and sighed full sore,
And there I shut her wild wild eyes
With kisses four.
And there she lullèd me asleep,
And there I dreamed—Ah! woe betide!—
The latest dream I ever dreamt
On the cold hill side.
I saw pale kings and princes too,
Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;
They cried—‘La Belle Dame sans Merci
Thee hath in thrall!’
I saw their starved lips in the gloam,
With horrid warning gapèd wide,
And I awoke and found me here,
On the cold hill’s side.
And this is why I sojourn here,
Alone and palely loitering,
Though the sedge is withered from the lake,
And no birds sing.","O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms, alone and palely loitering? The sedge has withered from the lake, and no birds sing. I met a lady in the meads, full beautiful, a faery’s child. She found me roots of relish sweet, and honey wild, and manna-dew. And sure in language strange she said— ‘I love thee true’","'La Belle Dame sans Merci' by John Keats is a beautiful poem about a fairy who condemns a knight after seducing him with her singing and looks. The first three stanzas introduce the unidentified speaker and the knight. The speaker comes across the knight wandering around in the dead of winter when “the sedge has withered from the lake/ And no birds sing.” In this way, Keats depicts a barren and bleak landscape. The knight responds to the speaker, telling him how he met a lady in the meadows who was “full beautiful, a faery's child”. Here, Keats' language sweetens. The first three stanzas were bitter and devoid of emotion, but the introduction of the “lady in the meads” produces softness in the language of the knight. He reminisces on the lady's beauty and her apparent innocence – her long hair, light feet, and wild eyes – and on her otherworldliness, as well. Moreover, he describes his sweet memories of the Lady: feeding each other, giving her presents, traveling with her, and being together. In the eighth stanza, the lady weeps for she knows that they cannot be together as she is a fairy, and he is a mortal. She lulls him to sleep out of which he does not immediately wake. In his dream, the knight sees pale people like kings, princes, and warriors. They tell him that he has been enthralled by the woman without mercy. He wakes up from the nightmare alone, on the cold hillside, and tells the persona that is why he stays there, wandering, looking for the lady. The last stanza leaves the fate of the knight ambiguous."
905,"Sit, drink your coffee here; your work can wait awhile.

Reciprocate in kind, or laugh at you instead.

The poem is directed at “you,” an unknown listener who stands in for all readers and listeners of the poem. Everyone can put themselves in this person's shoes. They are told, by the speaker, that they should put their work to the side and take pleasure in a moment of peace. The two can sit and talk about nothing or just stare off into space. The twenty minutes that they spend together is going to be important for the speaker. Then, he adds in the end, they will be observed by grackles, a kind of small blackbird, the whole time. This alludes to the fact of observation throughout the rest of one's life."
906,"Down, wanton, down! Have you no shame

Graves informs the “wanton” about the difference between lust and love. He compares the person with a captain of a warship that heads towards failure. The speaker says that “Love” may be blind and know no limits, but at least it knows the difference between a man and a beast. In the final lines, the speaker says that an immoral person would never have “Beauty” or “Love” by their side. He feels strongly about this, as indicated in the language, tone, and mood of the poem."

This poem is inspired by Horace's Poem 11 from Odes, Book 1. It is not clear whether Leuconoe is a real or fictional character, but the Greek name is usually used for females. In the beginning, the speaker (Horace) advises her that she should stop looking into the future that is “appointed by the gods for you and me.” It refers to the fate that Gods bestowed upon them. Further, he urges her to stop seeing the “Chaldean figures”—Chaldeans were an ancient group of people who lived and ruled Babylonia from 625 to 539 BC. They were known to be great astronomers and astrologers. Here, Horace asks Leuconoe not to seek the Chaldean Numerology in order to predict her future. According to the speaker, it is better to live in the moment than to wonder how many winters Jove, the king of god in ancient Roman religion, has in store for them. Overall, the poet sums up the sonnet by saying that let tomorrow come with what it wants, but it is always better to focus on the present moment."
908,"Out of Fisherman’s Wharf, San Fransisco, Sunday, early,
our vessel, bow to stern, some sixty-three feet,
to observe Blue Whales – and we did, off the Farallones. They were swimming slowly, and rose at a shallow angle
(they were grey as slate with white mottling, dorsals tiny and stubby,
with broad flat heads at least one quarter their overall body lengths).
They blew as soon as their heads began to break the surface.
The blows were as straight and slim as upright columns
rising to thirty feet in vertical props.
Then their heads disappeared underwater, and the lengthy, rolling
expanse of their backs hove into our view – about twenty feet longer
than the vessel herself. And then the diminutive dorsals
showed briefly, after the blows had dispersed and the heads had
gone under.
Then they arched their backs, then arched their tail stocks ready
for diving. Then the flukes were visible just before the creatures vanished,
slipping into the deep again, at a shallow angle.","Out of Fisherman’s Wharf, San Fransisco, Sunday, early, we went to observe Blue Whales – and we did, off the Farallones.

They blew as soon as their heads began to break the surface.","'Cetacean' by Peter Reading describes a speaker's whale watching experience off the coast of California and the overall grace of the blue whales he observed. The poem begins with the speaker stating that it was on an early Sunday morning that he, and his companions, set out to see the whales. They were intentionally going out to see blue whales and traveled to a set of islands off the coast of California, the “Farallones.” The speaker is successful in his quest and the rest of the poem is devoted to describing that experience. He frequently takes note of the grace of their bodies, as well as their general mass. He is amazed by their movements, and struck by the “diminutive” nature of their dorsal fins. The whales dive back under the water, rolling through the waves, showing off all the markings of their bodies. The display finally ends when they dive into the depths, leaving the narrator with the image of their “flukes,” or tail fins."
909,"Yes, injured Woman! rise, assert thy right!
Woman! too long degraded, scorned, opprest;
O born to rule in partial Law's despite,
Resume thy native empire o'er the breast!

Go forth arrayed in panoply divine;
That angel pureness which admits no stain;
Go, bid proud Man his boasted rule resign,
And kiss the golden sceptre of thy reign.

Go, gird thyself with grace; collect thy store
Of bright artillery glancing from afar;
Soft melting tones thy thundering cannon's roar,
Blushes and fears thy magazine of war.

Thy rights are empire: urge no meaner claim,—
Felt, not defined, and if debated, lost;
Like sacred mysteries, which withheld from fame,
Shunning discussion, are revered the most.

Try all that wit and art suggest to bend
Of thy imperial foe the stubborn knee;
Make treacherous Man thy subject, not thy friend;
Thou mayst command, but never canst be free.

Awe the licentious, and restrain the rude;
Soften the sullen, clear the cloudy brow:
Be, more than princes' gifts, thy favours sued;—
She hazards all, who will the least allow.

But hope not, courted idol of mankind,
On this proud eminence secure to stay;
Subduing and subdued, thou soon shalt find
Thy coldness soften, and thy pride give way.

Then, then, abandon each ambitious thought,
Conquest or rule thy heart shall feebly move,
In Nature's school, by her soft maxims taught,
That separate rights are lost in mutual love.","Woman! too long degraded, scorned, opprest;.O born to rule in partial Law's despite;.Resume thy native empire o'er the breast!Go forth arrayed in panoply divine;.That angel pureness which admits no stain;.Go, bid proud Man his boasted rule resign, and kiss the golden sceptre.","'The Rights of Women' by Anna Lætitia Barbauld intones the power that a woman might have if she resists social law and rises up to take control over the world. The poem begins with the speaker commanding all women of the world, especially those that have been stepped on and oppressed, to rise up and “assert” their rights. They should attempt to retake their place as leaders of the “empire. She tells them that it is time for man to step down from his throne and kiss the scepter of woman. The weapons that will be used in a woman's bid for the thrones of the world will be fought using the things that society has given her. She will use her blushes and “soft melting tones” to defeat mankind. Once having gained some power, a woman should not stop until she is in command of all of the empire, not just part. She will not be able to make friends with mankind, they must be subservient to the needs of women. In the final stanzas the speaker warns the women of the world that if they do regain power, they must not let themselves get weak. While Nature might try to sway them into some kind of reconciliation with man, they must not lite their “coldness” decrease. The maintaining of power must be at the forefront of their minds at all times."
910,"They shall not return to us, the resolute, the young,
The eager and whole-hearted whom we gave:
But the men who left them thriftily to die in their own dung,
Shall they come with years and honour to the grave?
They shall not return to us, the strong men coldly slain
In sight of help denied from day to day:
But the men who edged their agonies and chid them in their pain,
Are they too strong and wise to put away?
Our dead shall not return to us while Day and Night divide—
Never while the bars of sunset hold.
But the idle-minded overlings who quibbled while they died,
Shall they thrust for high employments as of old?
Shall we only threaten and be angry for an hour?
When the storm is ended shall we find
How softly but how swiftly they have sidled back to power
By the favour and contrivance of their kind?
Even while they soothe us, while they promise large amends,
Even while they make a show of fear,
Do they call upon their debtors, and take counsel with their friends,
To conform and re-establish each career?
Their lives cannot repay us—their death could not undo—
The shame that they have laid upon our race.
But the slothfulness that wasted and the arrogance that slew,
Shall we leave it unabated in its place?","They shall not return to us, the resolute, the young, the eager and whole-hearted whom we gave. But the men who left them thriftily to die in their own dung, they shall not come with years and honour to the grave. Their lives cannot repay us—their death could not undo.","'Mesopotamia' by Rudyard Kipling describes the aftermath of the siege of Kut-al-Amara and the lack of consequences that the politicians responsible will face for their “arrogance.” The poem begins with the speaker describing the loss of the men in Mesopotamia in the first two lines of each stanza. He describes the fact that there is no place or time on Earth in which these “whole-hearted” and “eager” men shall be returned to “us.” They were given up by the British government and military, without a second thought. Additionally, within the first stanzas, the speaker asks whether the men responsible for this loss will be held to account for it, or if they will go unpunished. In the second half of the poem, the speaker begins to direct his questions to the reader. He wants to know if the public will be able to keep up the outrage that “we” feel over what has happened, or if these emotions will pass without consequence."
911,"THERE'S no use in weeping,
Though we are condemned to part:
There's such a thing as keeping
A remembrance in one's heart:

There's such a thing as dwelling
On the thought ourselves have nurs'd,
And with scorn and courage telling
The world to do its worst.

We'll not let its follies grieve us,
We'll just take them as they come;
And then every day will leave us
A merry laugh for home.

When we've left each friend and brother,
When we're parted wide and far,
We will think of one another,
As even better than we are.

Every glorious sight above us,
Every pleasant sight beneath,
We'll connect with those that love us,
Whom we truly love till death !

In the evening, when we're sitting
By the fire perchance alone,
Then shall heart with warm heart meeting,
Give responsive tone for tone.

We can burst the bonds which chain us,
Which cold human hands have wrought,
And where none shall dare restrain us
We can meet again, in thought.

So there's no use in weeping,
Bear a cheerful spirit still;
Never doubt that Fate is keeping
Future good for present ill !","We'll not let its follies grieve us, we'll just take them as they come. We can burst the bonds which chain us, cold human hands have wrought.

'Parting' is an eight-stanza poem that is divided into sets of four lines, known as quatrains. Throughout this poem, Brontë's speaker describes her relationship to the listener, someone who is easily described as her lover. The two are forced to part from one another, but the speaker knows this isn't the end. No matter how far they go or what boundaries the world puts up in their way, they still have their memories. Plus, when feeling most alone, they can send out their thoughts to one another and be together as they used to."

The author also writes about his love of chickens, and his love for the city of New York.","The Red Wheelbarrow' by William Carlos Williams depicts, in very simple language, a red wheelbarrow outside in the rain. As an imagist poem, The Red Wheelbarrow is doing exactly what its supposed to. There is nothing “extra” about this piece. It is incredibly direct while also making use of memorable images that help the reader connect with what's being described. "

Cummings speaks about the lives of women who lived around the poet and whom he could not help but critique. In the poem's first lines, the speaker begins by describing the Cambridge women. These women are not beautiful, live comfortable lives, and are happy in their ignorance. They do not have the mental capacity, or the willingness, to engage with issues outside their own social bubbles. They wear masks, creations to help them fit in as they move from one function to the next and pretend to care about one cause for a limited period of time. These women, the poem concludes, would not notice if the moon rattled in the sky above their heads."
914,"Summer ends now; now, barbarous in beauty, the stooks rise
Around; up above, what wind-walks! what lovely behaviour
Of silk-sack clouds! has wilder, wilful-wavier

Up above, what wind-walks! what lovely behaviour of silk-sack clouds! has wilder, wilful-wavierMeal-drift moulded ever and melted across skies?","The theme of Hurrahing in Harvest is an experience of union with Christ as he is alive and present in Nature. The idea of Nature as an outward and visible expression of the presence of Christ is found in the New Testament, where Christ is described as: “a Son who is the radiance of his Father’s splendor and the full expression of his being; all creation depends for its support on his enabling word.” In the radiance and energy of an autumn day, Hopkins meets his Christ whose fire, beauty, and energy suffuse all created forms. Christ is seen by the poet as embodied in the power and beauty of the hills; Christ’s power and beauty are then found reflected in the proud stallion and the modest violet. The full power and beauty of a scene of Nature are released only when a human witness arrives there; then this power and beauty lends wings to the human heart which almost leaves behind earthly existence and soars upwards to the sky in a mood of ecstasy."

In a form of writing where ideas and images can be representative of entirely different things, an evocation of emotion is the strongest tool for relaying an idea through metaphor or any other poetic device. In Thomas Hardy’s ‘Overlooking the River Stour’, evocation is the primary storytelling device; it is a work heavy with imagery and metaphor and one that relays feeling without expressing feeling, something that is generally very difficult to do — and yet, ‘Overlooking the River Stour’ is a vast creative display of emotion-charged scenery."
916,"In Flanders fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row,
That mark our place; and in the sky
The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.
We are the Dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
Loved and were loved, and now we lie,
In Flanders fields.
Take up our quarrel with the foe:
To you from failing hands we throw
The torch; be yours to hold it high.
If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields.","In Flanders fields the poppies blow                Between the crosses, row on row,                That mark our place.                The larks, still bravely singing, fly                Scarce heard amid the guns below.                Take up our quarrel with the foe: to you from failing hands we throw                The torch; be yours to hold it high.","“In Flanders Fields” by John McCrae is a well-known, and much revered, poem concerning the many lived lost in Flanders, Belgium during World War I. The poem begins by introducing the image of the poppy that has come to be closely associated with remembering World War I. The narrator states that in Flanders, the poppies are blowing in rows between the rows of crosses marking the graves of fallen soldiers. The reader gets an idea that this field is vast and covered with crosses marking graves, and simply placed as remembrances for fallen men. Above them, larks are flying and “bravely singing” above the gun fire below. The second stanza describes the men as they once were. They used to live as the reader does now, feeling the sun, and loving and being loved. The poet is hoping to create empathy between the reader/readers and those fallen. He hopes to create a firmer image in the reader's mind as to what these men were like. Now though, they have all passed. They lie now “in Flanders fields.” The final stanza is a call to arms. The poet is speaking directly to the reader telling them that it is now their turn to fight and stand up against the forces that are seeking to destroy them. They must take the torch from the “failing hands” of the dead and live on for them. The poem concludes by stating that unless their war is fought on by others, they will never rest, even if they do lie amongst the poppies."

'An Acrostic' by Edgar Allan Poe is a poem discussing the validity of Elizabeth's statement about love. The poet makes several mythical and contemporary references in the poem. The main subject matter of the poem, as the message of the poem says, is “Elizabeth”. The poet wrote this in response to the poem, 'Warning' by L.E.L. Letitia Elizabeth Landon, popularly known by her initials L.E.L., was a British author and poet. She was a contemporary of Edgar Allan Poe. In her poem 'Warning', she wrote, I have said, heart, be content!For Love's power o'er thee is spent.That I love not now, oh true!–I have bade such dreams adieu: In response to the phrase “I love not”, Poe tried to present a different viewpoint regarding love in his poem, 'An Acrostic'."
918,"The art of losing isn’t hard to master;

to be lost that their loss is no disaster.

Perhaps her most well-known poem, it centers around the theme of loss and the way in which the speaker – and, by extension, the reader – deals with it. Here, Bishop converts losing into an art form and explores how, by potentially mastering this skill, we may distance ourselves from the pain of loss. At eight months old, Elizabeth Bishop lost her father, her mother then succumbed to mental illness and she later lost her lover to suicide. Therefore, we may see this poem as in part autobiographical. In it, the poet presents a list of things we may lose in life, increasing in importance, until the final culmination in the loss of a loved one."

The speaker spends the fourteen lines of this poem suggesting some things that could, in one way or another, define poetry. Rather than simply stating what they think poetry is, they provided a complicated collection of ideas that evoke the feelings of poetry. The poem ends with one final question, suggesting that poetry should reveal something, and that uses the traditional image of flowers."

The poem begins with a description of a speaker's place. It is winter and blue, dim light is everywhere. She lives in central Italy where the Etruscan wall arts can be found. Her house is nearby. The poetic journey to the interior of the artworks begins from this place. She directly welcomes readers to participate in the process of reflection along with her. Her main focus is on the fresco of a girl created by the famous artist of San Sepolcro, Piero della Francesca. It is a reference to the fresco of Madonna del Parto. Graham describes how the motif of the art unbuttons her mind and helps her to see through it."

In the first lines of 'The Starry Night,' the speaker begins by referring to the town at the base of the painting and to the hair-like tree that dominates the left-hand side. She uses a great deal of figurative language to describe these sights and the stars around them. There is a refrain at the end of this stanza and the next that suggests a specific way the speaker would like to die. This isn't detailed until the final stanza. She also explores the movements in the sky and how they appear as a serpent, swallowing up the stars that are, perhaps, produced by the god-like sun. The final stanza describes how she wants to be swallowed by this same beast and taken into the sky without a “flag” or a “cry.”"

The poem begins with the speaker telling his readers that if one I seeking out an opportunity to confess one’s feelings of affection for another, don’t. It will be a mistake that will lead to nothing good. The speaker compares what would seem to be a simple confession to a “gentle wind.” Just because one cannot see it, does not mean it will not be felt and make an impact. He then goes on to tell of his own past and what happened when he confessed to his “love.” He told his truth and she turned from him, she did not return his affections, but departed. It was a life-changing moment for him, but not a happy one. In the last stanza, he describes his own surprise at this turn of events and the fact that even though his life has changed the world is moving on. The changes that he felt, while invisible, still carry a big impact. He must move on with the world to avoid being frozen in that state for the rest of time."

They should remember the role their parents played in giving them life and how they gave their father and mother life as well. She moves on to discuss how interconnected all people are to one another and the other lives around them. Animals and plants all have their families and histories.

In conclusion, the speaker asks the reader or listener to take these moments of peace and use them to help one make the most of the day ahead."
925,"There are many that I miss
having sent my last one out a car window
sparking along the road one night, years ago.

The heralded one, of course:
after sex, the two glowing tips
now the lights of a single ship;
at the end of a long dinner
with more wine to come
and a smoke ring coasting into the chandelier;
or on a white beach,
holding one with fingers still wet from a swim.

How bittersweet these punctuations
of flame and gesture;
but the best were on those mornings
when I would have a little something going
in the typewriter,
the sun bright in the windows,
maybe some Berlioz on in the background.
I would go into the kitchen for coffee
and on the way back to the page,
curled in its roller,
I would light one up and feel
its dry rush mix with the dark taste of coffee.

Then I would be my own locomotive,
trailing behind me as I returned to work
little puffs of smoke,
indicators of progress,
signs of industry and thought,
the signal that told the nineteenth century
it was moving forward.
That was the best cigarette,
when I would steam into the study
full of vaporous hope
and stand there,
the big headlamp of my face
pointed down at all the words in parallel lines.","There are many that I miss having sent my last one out a car window, years ago. The best were on those mornings when I would have a little something going in the typewriter, with the sun bright in the windows, and Berlioz on in the background. I would light one up and feel its dry rush mix with the dark taste of coffee.","The Best Cigarette' by Billy Collins uses past experiences with smoking to describe the important in-between, transitory moments in one's life. The poem begins with the speaker describing how there are many cigarettes he misses, but there are some that are more important than others. He goes through a number of examples, explaining that cigarettes after dinner, sex, and swimming are some of the most poignant in his mind. The third and fourth stanzas are dedicated to the experiences with smoking he misses the most. He discusses how he'd always have coffee and a cigarette while writing if he thought it was going well."
926,"Pity the poor step-sister those big feet
she’ll never stuff in a size-six sonnet,

her flesh so fulsome the slipper seems effete,
unworthy of the labor spent on it.

But try she must, and so she makes a pass,
jams four fat toes in the narrow throat,

the fifth pig smarting, pressed against the glass
(though pain’s no stranger—she knows it by rote.)

The other shoe drops—as it is wont to do—
a second foot is squeezed into the vamp.

She stands up straight and takes a stride towards you,
her footfall heavy as a farmgirl’s tramp.

The slipper strains against those excess feet.
She hobbles onward—she has a prince to meet.","Pity the poor step-sister those big feet, says the poet. But try she must, and so she makes a pass, he writes. ""She stands up straight and takes a stride towards you, her footfall heavy as a farmgirl’s tramp""","“Glass Slipper Sonnet” by Angela Alaimo O’Donnell takes the classic tale of Cinderella and trades in the typical approach of focusing sympathy and understanding on Cinderella herself to discuss the life of one “step-sister.” That life turns out to be one that is sad and hopeless since the “step-sister” realizes she does not fit into “the slipper,” but she is so accustomed to the notion of not fitting in that she is willing to overlook the detail to reach for a royal life with “a prince.” Despite her efforts, the ill-fit of the “shoe[s]” cannot be hidden due to their impact on her “stride,” and that inability to fit into something she is not matched for is a representation of how she cannot move away from her station in life to become anything higher. What is worse is the poem makes it clear that she has learned to feel out of place, meaning her entire life could be represented in her struggles with “the slipper[s].” She has never fit in, and nothing in her present situation allows her a way to change that. For these details, “[p]ity” is a reasonable response for her story."
927,"———The sky is overcast
With a continuous cloud of texture close,
Heavy and wan, all whitened by the Moon,
Which through that veil is indistinctly seen,
A dull, contracted circle, yielding light
So feebly spread, that not a shadow falls,
Chequering the ground—from rock, plant, tree, or tower.
At length a pleasant instantaneous gleam
Startles the pensive traveller while he treads
His lonesome path, with unobserving eye
Bent earthwards; he looks up—the clouds are split
Asunder,—and above his head he sees
The clear Moon, and the glory of the heavens.
There, in a black-blue vault she sails along,
Followed by multitudes of stars, that, small
And sharp, and bright, along the dark abyss
Drive as she drives: how fast they wheel away,
Yet vanish not!—the wind is in the tree,
But they are silent;—still they roll along
Immeasurably distant; and the vault,
Built round by those white clouds, enormous clouds,
Still deepens its unfathomable depth.
At length the Vision closes; and the mind,
Not undisturbed by the delight it feels,
Which slowly settles into peaceful calm,
Is left to muse upon the solemn scene.","The sky is overcast with a continuous cloud of texture close,                Heavy and wan, all whitened by the Moon,                Which through that veil is indistinctly seen,                A dull, contracted circle, yielding light so feebly spread, that not a shadow falls,                Chequering the ground—from rock, plant, tree, or tower.                There, in a black-blue vault she sails along,                Followed by multitudes of stars, that, small, and bright, along the dark abyss, drive as she drives.                Yet vanish not!—the wind is in the tree, but they are silent;—still they roll along","“A Night-Piece” by William Wordsworth details a brief moment in which the speaker, as well as a traveler on the ground below, marvel over the majesty of the sky, moon, and clouds above them. The sky is initially cast as a mysterious, dark place, but this image is soon broken as the clouds separate and the moon burst through, surprising the ”pensive” traveler on the ground. The power of the moon is described, as “she” moves through the sky and is followed by the stars that always keep pace with her. These images are used as a metaphor for the power and consistent presence of God. Even when God, or the light of the moon in this case, cannot be seen, it does not mean it is not there. The poem concludes with the breaking of this religiously inspired moment with nature, and the speaker and traveler are calmer, and better, for it. Their minds muse on the experience as all continues as it did before."
928,"I will go with my father a-ploughing
To the green field by the sea,
And the rooks and the crows and the seagulls

And the rooks and the gulls and starlings will come flocking after me.,"'I Will Go With My Father a-Ploughing' by Joseph Campbell describes the months of a boy's life as he works alongside his father, “ploughing,” “sowing,” and “reaping.” The poem begins with the speaker traveling with his father to “plough” the lands “by the sea.” It is there that he sees three different types of birds and hears his father singing the appropriate song for this time of year, the “Plough-Song.” The poet continues this pattern throughout the rest of the poem, having his speaker describe in turn the time for sowing and for reaping. In each stanza, the poet repeats the same pattern of lines to show the repetition of the year, as well as the constant changes that come over the land."
929,"No coward soul is mine
No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere
I see Heaven's glories shine
And Faith shines equal arming me from Fear

O God within my breast
Almighty ever-present Deity
Life, that in me hast rest,
As I Undying Life, have power in Thee

Vain are the thousand creeds
That move men's hearts, unutterably vain,
Worthless as withered weeds
Or idlest froth amid the boundless main

To waken doubt in one
Holding so fast by thy infinity,
So surely anchored on
The steadfast rock of Immortality.

With wide-embracing love
Thy spirit animates eternal years
Pervades and broods above,
Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates and rears

Though earth and moon were gone
And suns and universes ceased to be
And Thou wert left alone

There is not room for Death
Nor atom that his might could render void
Since thou art Being and Breath
And what thou art may never be destroyed.","No coward soul is mine. No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere. I see Heaven's glories shine. Faith shines equal arming me from Fear. O God within my breast. Thee are the thousand creeds that move men's hearts, unutterably vain.","'No Coward Soul Is Mine' by Emily Brontë describes a speaker's overwhelming passion for God and the strength that she is able to draw from her faith. The poem begins with the speaker stating that she is untouched by fear. The love she has for God, and the power with which she has been bestowed, due to that love, make her unafraid of death. She describes others who are not of the same moral caliber as she is, and sees them as less. She calls them “Vain” and makes sure to inform the reader that any temptation that might come her way is hopeless against the “boundless main” which is her faith. The speaker knows that God's love is without limits. There is nothing that could happen to her, or happen to the world that would eradicate that. The poem concludes with the speaker once more stating that although death is powerful “he” is nothing against the strength of God."
930,"I decide to do it free, without a rope or net.
First, the old brogues, dusty and cracked;
an easy scramble onto his trousers,
pushing into the weave, trying to get a grip.
By the overhanging shirt I change
direction, traverse along his belt
to an earth-stained hand. The nails
are splintered and give good purchase,
the skin of his finger is smooth and thick
like warm ice. On his arm I discover
the glassy ridge of a scar, place my feet
gently in the old stitches and move on.
At his still firm shoulder, I rest for a while
in the shade, not looking down,
for climbing has its dangers, then pull
myself up the loose skin of his neck
to a smiling mouth to drink among teeth.
Refreshed, I cross the screed cheek,
to stare into his brown eyes, watch a pupil
slowly open and close. Then up over
the forehead, the wrinkles well-spaced
and easy, to his thick hair (soft and white
at this altitude), reaching for the summit,
where gasping for breath I can only lie
watching clouds and birds circle,
feeling his heat, knowing
the slow pulse of his good heart.","I decide to do it free, without a rope or net. I climb up to the summit, gasping for breath, watching clouds and birds circle.

'Climbing My Grandfather' by Andrew Waterhouse is an open letter of admiration for his grandfather. The poet remembers a time when he was a child and his grandfather looked to him more like a giant than a human being. As a child, the poet talks about the massiveness of his grandfather, and vividly describes from 'toe to head' the physical structure of his grandfather imagining him like a mountain. Since the poem starts with the present tense it makes us feel as if we are also climbing with him. Moreover, the very title of the poem tells us what the poet is going to discuss though it creates a little confusion at first. But it becomes clear as we read in the poem to the end."
931,"When Winter’s ahead,
What can you read in November
That you read in April
When Winter’s dead?

I hear the thrush, and I see
Him alone at the end of the lane
Near the bare poplar’s tip,
Singing continuously.

Is it more that you know
Than that, even as in April,
So in November,
Winter is gone that must go?


Or is all your lore
Not to call November November,
And April April,
And Winter Winter – no more?

But I know the months all,
And their sweet names, April,
May and June and October,
As you call and call

I must remember
What died into April
And consider what will be born
Of a fair November;

And April I love for what
It was born of, and November
For what it will die in,
What they are and what they are not,

While you love what is kind,
What you can sing in
And love and forget in
All that’s ahead and behind.","When Winter’s ahead, what can you read in November that you can read in April? I hear the thrush, and I see him alone at the end of the lane, singing continuously. I know the months all, all, and their sweet names, April, May and June and October.","'The Thrush' by Edward Thomas is a beautiful poem in which the poet explores time and the seasons, focusing on how different the human experience is from the thrush's. Throughout the stanzas of 'The Thrush,' the speaker addresses a thrush he can see signing on a branch. He wonders about the bird's thought process and if it has any idea about the passing of the seasons. Does it know, he thinks, about November and April? Or does it live only in happy moments and sad ones, ones in which it can't sing and ones in which it can. It's the latter that he decides upon and he concludes the poem by suggesting that there is some beauty in this perspective on life."
932,"A little time for laughter,
A little time to sing,
A little time to kiss and cling,
And no more kissing after.

A little while for scheming
Love's unperfected schemes;
A little time for golden dreams,
Then no more any dreaming.

A little while 'twas given
To me to have thy love;
Now, like a ghost, alone I move
About a ruined heaven.

A little time for speaking
Things sweet to say and hear;
A time to seek, and find thee near,
Then no more any seeking.

A little time for saying
Words the heart breaks to say;
A short sharp time wherein to pray,
Then no more need of praying;

But long, long years to weep in,
And comprehend the whole
Great grief that desolates the soul,
And eternity to sleep in.","A little while 'twas given to me to have thy love; now, like a ghost, alone I move about a ruined heaven.

'After' by Philip Bourke Marston talks about the poetic persona's little wishes. He doesn't want anything bigger from life except for pleasant things that cheer the heart. Likewise, in the first three stanzas, the poet talks about the lady whom he loved. Now, she is not with the poet. For this reason, he desires those things that once made him feel happy. In the following two stanzas, the poet says what he really wants to say to his beloved. There is still something left in his heart that he wants to tell her about. Moreover, in the last stanza, the poet sighs for the “long, long” years that he has to live alone with a sad heart. What is left in him, is the endless heartache. It will only end in eternal sleep."
933,"By channels of coolness the echoes are calling,
And down the dim gorges I hear the creek falling;
It lives in the mountain, where moss and the sedges
Touch with their beauty the banks and the ledges;
Through brakes of the cedar and sycamore bowers
Struggles the light that is love to the flowers.
And, softer than slumber, and sweeter than singing,
The notes of the bell-birds are running and ringing.
The silver-voiced bell-birds, the darlings of day-time,
They sing in September their songs of the May-time.
When shadows wax strong and the thunder-bolts hurtle,
They hide with their fear in the leaves of the myrtle;
When rain and the sunbeams shine mingled together
They start up like fairies that follow fair weather,
And straightway the hues of their feathers unfolden
Are the green and the purple, the blue and the golden.
October, the maiden of bright yellow tresses,
Loiters for love in these cool wildernesses;
Loiters knee-deep in the grasses to listen,
Where dripping rocks gleam and the leafy pools glisten.
Then is the time when the water-moons splendid
Break with their gold, and are scattered or blended
Over the creeks, till the woodlands have warning
Of songs of the bell-bird and wings of the morning.
Welcome as waters unkissed by the summers
Are the voices of bell-birds to thirsty far-comers.
When fiery December sets foot in the forest,
And the need of the wayfarer presses the sorest,
Pent in the ridges for ever and ever.
The bell-birds direct him to spring and to river,
With ring and with ripple, like runnels whose torrents
Are toned by the pebbles and leaves in the currents.
Often I sit, looking back to a childhood
Mixt with the sights and the sounds of the wildwood,
Longing for power and the sweetness to fashion
Lyrics with beats like the heart-beats of passion --
Songs interwoven of lights and of laughters
Borrowed from bell-birds in far forest rafters;
So I might keep in the city and alleys
The beauty and strength of the deep mountain valleys,
Charming to slumber the pain of my losses
With glimpses of creeks and a vision of mosses.","The author writes about the beauty and pain of the mountain valleys. The author also writes about his love of the wildwood and the songs of the birds. The book is called ""The Song of the Mountain"" and is published by Simon & Schuster at £16.99 (US)","'Bell Birds' by Henry Kendall describes the beauty of a local wooded landscape and the passion and inspiration a speaker gains from its depths. The poem begins with the speaker describing the general outline of the forest. It is a place in which he can see the “mountain” and take a long look at the “mosses and sedges.” Additionally, he can hear the waters of the rivers and the singing of the “bell-birds.” As the poem continues the speaker devotes his time to describe what the best season of the year, spring, is like. This is when the birds are at their most passionate and the yellow and golden wattles are shining. Eventually, summer comes but the beauty is not decreased. This does mark a change in the text though. The speaker introduces a “wayfarer” who is likely a separate version of himself. This person is seeking out relief in the woods, in the form of water, and the birds guide him to it. In conclusion, he states that he wants to be able to capture the beauty of the forest in his “Song” or writings. This would allow him to take it back to the city where he needs it the most."
934,"O stony grey soil of Monaghan
The laugh from my love you thieved;
You took the gay child of my passion
And gave me your clod-conceived.

You clogged the feet of my boyhood
And I believed that my stumble
Had the poise and stride of Apollo
And his voice my thick tongued mumble.

You told me the plough was immortal!
O green-life conquering plough!
The mandril stained, your coulter blunted
In the smooth lea-field of my brow.

You sang on steaming dunghills
A song of cowards' brood,
You perfumed my clothes with weasel itch,
You fed me on swinish food

You flung a ditch on my vision
Of beauty, love and truth.
O stony grey soil of Monaghan
You burgled my bank of youth!

Lost the long hours of pleasure
All the women that love young men.

Or write with unpoisoned pen.

Or mention the dark fields where
The first gay flight of my lyric
Got caught in a peasant's prayer.

The poem begins with the speaker giving a few details about his home. These details quickly expand and it becomes clear that the poet did not enjoy his youth. In fact, he believes that he didn't really have one. From a young age the happiness of boyhood was crushed. His dreams were squashed and hopeful ideas were snuffed out. They were replaced by the immortality of farming and the necessity of farming equipment. In the last couple of stanzas, the speaker explains how all this negativity in his childhood made him the person he is while writing the poem. His verses are influenced by the poisoned pen of “stony grey” Monaghan. While the county took a lot from him, it gave him the “Dead loves” that populate his verse."
935,"She died in the upstairs bedroom

The poem takes the reader through the death room of an unnamed woman. It looked out over Leamington Spa and held on to a quiet peace, even after her passing. Silence permeates every line of this poem, even the ones that contain dialogue as the nurse speaks out loud. Unaware that the woman has passed away, the nurse talks to her. Her voice breaks this silence, therefore drawing a reader's attention to its absence. The nurse, upon realizing the woman has died, slips back into quiet and moves respectfully out of the room."
936,"Whatever else we learned
at school, like solemn Afro-Gods eager for grades,
of Helen and the shades
of borrowed ancestors,
there are no rites
for those who have returned,
only, when her looms fade,
drilled in our skulls, the doom-
surge-haunted nights,
only this well-known passage

swayed in his lifted hand.","Whatever else we learned at school, like solemn Afro-Gods eager for grades, there are no rites for those who have returned.

The poem opens with the speaker addressing a group who understands life as he does. He's been away from his home for a long time, creating a career for himself. He's returned, and things are not as he expected. The poet uses allusions, both to the Bible and to Greek mythology, in order to paint a picture of the situation. He does not feel accepted, nor does he feel the same love for his home he once did. His new, broader understanding of the world has made what was beautiful, and welcoming feel off-putting and, at times, scary."

They are able to commune with nature and, in part, fulfill their senses and hungry spirituality. Eventually, the speaker asks God, and the wider world of nature, to accept them. They want to be able to live unselfconsciously and to wear a “new dress” that is made of “questions unanswered.” This person is seeking a new way of being in the world that is not defined by city life or purely secular thought."
938,"Thou spark of life that wavest wings of gold,
Thou songless wanderer mid the songful birds,
With Nature's secrets in thy tints unrolled
Through gorgeous cipher, past the reach of words,
Yet dear to every child
In glad pursuit beguiled,
Living his unspoiled days mid flowers and flocks and herds!

Thou winged blossom, liberated thing,
What secret tie binds thee to other flowers,
Still held within the garden's fostering?
Will they too soar with the completed hours,
Take flight, and be like thee
Irrevocably free,
Hovering at will o'er their parental bowers?

Or is thy luster drawn from heavenly hues, -
A sumptuous drifting fragment of the sky,
Caught when the sunset its last glance imbues
With sudden splendor, and the tree-tops high
Grasp that swift blazonry,
Then lend those tints to thee,
On thee to float a few short hours, and die?

And flit on errands all the livelong day;
Each fieldmouse keeps the homestead whence it sprung;
But thou art Nature's freeman, - free to stray
Unfettered through the wood,
Seeking thine airy food,
The sweetness spiced on every blossomed spray.

The garden one wide banquet spreads for thee,
O daintiest reveller of the joyous earth!
One drop of honey gives satiety;
A second draught would drug thee past all mirth.
Thy feast no orgy shows;
Thy calm eyes never close,
Thou soberest sprite to which the sun gives birth.

And yet the soul of man upon thy wings
Forever soars in aspiration; thou
His emblem of the new career that springs
When death's arrest bids all his spirit bow.
He seeks his hope in thee
Of immortality.

Here the poet portrays it as a symbol of life and free-spirit. This poem begins with a reference to the butterfly as the “spark of life”. Thereafter, the poet goes on comparing the butterfly with other creatures of nature. According to the poet, the butterfly symbolizes the essence of life and its lovely wings symbolize freedom. The speaker of the poem thinks it to be a fostering child of nature. It gets its hue from the heavens and feeds on the honey that soothes its soul, not inebriates it. At last, the poet describes it as a “Symbol of life” and seeks hope from the creature."
939,"Still, I keep myself, I take
to bed. One lung is red. Cut red
flowers hung in pink water.

My other lung is out of  line.
From one lung, I tell the truth.
From the other lung, I lie.
Cut pink flowers hung in red water.

Like a pain, the truth is mine.
The lie is that today I want to die.
Cut red water hung in pink flowers.

The rest of it is stillness, rest.
A soft cough into a hard pan.
A hard cough into a soft plane.
Cut pink water hung in red flowers","Still, I keep myself, I take                to bed. One lung is red. Cut red                flowers hung in pink water. The other lung is out of line. The lie is that today I want to die. The rest of it is stillness, rest.","'The Rest' by Jane Huffman focuses on illness and an unsuccessful attempt at recovery. The main sickness explored is lung pain, with Huffman portraying a constant pain she carries around. The use of water imagery suggests the tainting of something pure, reflecting the lung becoming infected. There is no sense of rest in the poem. One can assume the 'Rest' that Huffman refers to in the title is an oncoming sense of dying. The poem is tragic, exploring the physical impacts of sickness upon the human body."
940,"Getting up early on a Sunday morning
leaving them sleep for the sake of peace,
the lunch pungent, windows open
for a blackbird singing in Cyncoed.
Starlings glistening in the gutter come
for seed. I let the cats in from the night,
their fur already glossed and warm with March.
I bring the milk, newspaper, settle here
in the bay of the window to watch people
walking to church for Mothering Sunday.
A choirboy holds his robes over his shoulder.
The cats jump up on windowsills to wash
and tremble at the starlings. Like peaty water
sun slowly fills the long brown room.
Opening the paper I admit to this
the water-shriek and starved stare
of a warning I can't name.","Getting up early on a Sunday morning                leaving them sleep for the sake of peace.

Like peaty water the sun slowly fills the long brown room.","'Sunday' by Gillian Clarke is a highly relatable poem in which the poet's Sunday morning is disrupted by the world's news. The poem's first fifteen lines are dedicated to a description of the speaker getting up and enjoying a peaceful morning. Her Sunday continues easily and smoothly as she lets the cats in and observes people going to church outside. After reading the newspaper, she is reminded of the true nature of everyday life and its many cruelties."
941,"To one who has been long in city pent,
'Tis very sweet to look into the fair
And open face of heaven,—to breathe a prayer
Full in the smile of the blue firmament.
Who is more happy, when, with heart's content,
Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair
Of wavy grass, and reads a debonair
And gentle tale of love and languishment?
Returning home at evening, with an ear
Catching the notes of Philomel,—an eye
Watching the sailing cloudlet's bright career,
He mourns that day so soon has glided by:
E'en like the passage of an angel's tear
That falls through the clear ether silently.","To one who has been long in city pent up, it is very sweet to look into the fairAnd open face of heaven. To breathe a prayer                Full in the smile of the blue firmament. Who is more happy, when, with heart's content, sinks into some pleasant lair                Of wavy grass, and reads a debonair tale of love and languishment?","John Keats, in his poem 'To one who has been long in city pent' describes the experience of a city-dweller, who goes on a holiday to the countryside. Having been living in the city for a long time, the person finds life at the countryside, mind-blowing and nature, awe-inspiring. The speaker captures the delight of the city-dweller beautifully as he moves and breathes in the open air and his heart is filled with the joy of the sky that is free from dust, smoke, and the bustle of city life. The city-dweller feels the happiness of heaven on earth. Eventually, the day ends he returns home. On his way back too, he enjoys the sweet song of the nightingale and the clouds floating about the sky. The day rolled by quickly, that the poet compares it to the tear of the Angel flowing down through the clear sky unnoticed."
942,"hate the people of this village

This piece is written in the context of the Gulf War. Lux shows how people from a particular nation hate that of the other due to their distinct culture, origin, and identity. He uses the metaphor of villagers in order to hint at the people living in two different countries. They showed extreme hatred and distrust toward one another. Their discord did not originate from the misdoings or inhumane acts of a particular group. In this poem, Lux records a list of things that they did to each other."
943,"O dear little cabin, I've loved you so long,
And now I must bid you good-bye!
I've filled you with laughter, I've thrilled you with song,
And sometimes I've wished I could cry.
Your walls they have witnessed a weariful fight,
And rung to a won Waterloo:
But oh, in my triumph I'm dreary to-night --
Good-bye, little cabin, to you!
Your roof is bewhiskered, your floor is a-slant,
Your walls seem to sag and to swing;
I'm trying to find just your faults, but I can't --
You poor, tired, heart-broken old thing!
I've seen when you've been the best friend that I had,
Your light like a gem on the snow;
You're sort of a part of me -- Gee! but I'm sad;
I hate, little cabin, to go.

Below your cracked window red raspberries climb;
A hornet's nest hangs from a beam;
Your rafters are scribbled with adage and rhyme,
And dimmed with tobacco and dream.
""Each day has its laugh"", and ""Don't worry, just work"".
Such mottoes reproachfully shine.
Old calendars dangle -- what memories lurk
About you, dear cabin of mine!

I hear the world-call and the clang of the fight;
I hear the hoarse cry of my kind;
Yet well do I know, as I quit you to-night,
It's Youth that I'm leaving behind.
And often I'll think of you, empty and black,
Moose antlers nailed over your door:
Oh, if I should perish my ghost will come back
To dwell in you, cabin, once more!

How cold, still and lonely, how weary you seem!
A last wistful look and I'll go.
Oh, will you remember the lad with his dream!
The lad that you comforted so.
The shadows enfold you, it's drawing to-night;
The evening star needles the sky:
And huh! but it's stinging and stabbing my sight --
God bless you, old cabin, good-bye!","O dear little cabin, I've loved you so long, and now I must bid you good-bye! I've thrilled you with song, sometimes I've wished I could cry. I'm trying to find just your faults, but I can't -- you poor, tired, heart-broken old thing!","“All good things must come to an end” appears to be the motif in Robert Service’s ‘Good-Bye, Little Cabin’, a memorable poem that is perhaps one of his more grounded works, based in his own world — in reality — rather than the creation of a story that was rather based on what he saw around him. It is also one of his more emotional pieces, and serves as a solid way of demonstrating that he very much knew his way around poetic devices; his strong command of verse is good enough to make the reader care both about the narrator and the inanimate object being described! This poem showcases many of Service’s strengths as a poet and creates a clear understanding of the reader of the powerful pull that can be created even by one little cabin."
944,"Evening will come, however determined the late afternoon,
Limes and oaks in their last green flush, pearled in September mist.
I have conjured a lily to light these hours, a token of thanks,
Zones and auras of soft glare framing the brilliant globes.
A promise made and kept for life - that was your gift -
Because of which, here is a gift in return, glovewort to some,
Each shining bonnet guarded by stern lance-like leaves.
The country loaded its whole self into your slender hands,
Hands that can rest, now, relieved of a century’s weight.
Evening has come. Rain on the black lochs and dark Munros.
Lily of the Valley, a namesake almost, a favourite flower
Interlaced with your famous bouquets, the restrained
Zeal and forceful grace of its lanterns, each inflorescence
A silent bell disguising a singular voice. A blurred new day
Breaks uncrowned on remote peaks and public parks, and
Everything turns on these luminous petals and deep roots,
This lily that thrives between spire and tree, whose brightness
Holds and glows beyond the life and border of its bloom.","Evening will come, however determined the late afternoon, says the poet. Limes and oaks in their last green flush, pearled in September mist. The country loaded its whole self into your slender hands, he writes. The lily that thrives between spire and tree, whose brightness holds and glows beyond the life of its bloom.","'Floral Tribute' by Simon Armitage alludes to Queen Elizabeth's lifetime of service and expresses a country's gratitude. The poem begins with the speaker alluding to the day that Queen Elizabeth will pass away. It's represented by the evening, which will eventually usurp the “determined” afternoon. The poet continues in this way, relating time and seasons to Queen Elizabeth's life. He brings in images of a Lily of the Valley flower and connects its features to Queen Elizabeth. It's stern and “shining,” just as she was. This provides a transition into a clear allusion to her recent passing. The speaker describes her hands as having been relieved of the weight of her reign upon her death. In the poem's second part, the speaker begins by saying that evening is finally here. Queen Elizabeth passed away, something that's seen physically in the British landscape, particularly in Scotland, where she died in Balmoral castle, which is consumed by rain. In amongst this darkness is the bright Lily of the Valley flower that is “restrained” and “forceful.” It depicts her “singular voice” that was at the heart of British life for so long. The poem concludes with an allusion to the vast impact that Queen Elizabeth had during her life and how many beyond the borders of the UK are mourning her."
945,"Low was our pretty Cot: our tallest Rose
Peep’d at the chamber-window. We could hear
At silent noon, and eve, and early morn,
The Sea’s faint murmur. In the open air
Our Myrtles blossom’d; and across the porch
Thick Jasmins twined: the little landscape round
Was green and woody, and refresh’d the eye.
It was a spot which you might aptly call
The Valley of Seclusion! Once I saw
(Hallowing his Sabbath-day by quiteness)
A wealthy son of Commerce saunter by,
Bristowa’s citizen: methought, it calm’d
His thirst of idle gold, and made him muse
With wiser feelings: for he paus’d, and look’d
With a pleas’d sadness, and gaz’d all around,
Then eyed our Cottage, and gaz’d round again,
And sigh’d, and said, it was a Blesséd Place.
And we were bless’d. Oft with patient ear
Long-listening to the viewless sky-lark’s note
(Viewless, or haply for a moment seen
Gleaming on sunny wings) in whisper’d tones
I said to my Belovéd, `Such, sweet Girl!
The inobtrusive song of Happiness,
Unearthly minstrelsy! then only heard
When the Soul seeks to hear ; when all is hush’d,
And the Heart listens!’
 But the time, when first
From that low Dell, steep up the stony Mount
I climb’d with perilous toil and reach’d the top,
Oh! what a goodly scene! Here the bleak mount,
The bare bleak mountain speckled thin with sheep;
Grey clouds, that shadowing spot the sunny fields;
And river, now with bushy rocks o’er-brow’d,
Now winding bright and full, with naked banks;
And seats, and lawns, the Abbey and the wood,
And cots, and hamlets, and faint city-spire;
The Channel there, the Islands and white sails,
Dim coasts, and cloud-like hills, and shoreless Ocean--
It seem’d like Omnipresence! God, methought,
Had build him there a Temple: the whole World
Seem’d imag’d in its vast circumference:
No wish profan’d my overwhelméd heart.
Blest hour! It was a luxury,--to be!
 Ah! quiet Dell! dear Cot, and Mount sublime!
I was constrain’d to quit you. Was it right,
While my unnumber’d brethren toil’d and bled,
That I should dream away the entrusted hours
On rose-leaf beds, pampering the coward heart
With feelings all too delicate for use?
Sweet is the tear that from some Howard’s eye
Drops on the cheek of one he lifts from earth:
And he that works me good with unmov’d face,
Does it but half: he chills me while he aids,
My benefactor, not my brother man!
Yet even this, this cold beneficience
Praise, praise it, O my Soul! oft as thou scann’st
The sluggard Pity’s vision-weaving tribe!
Who sigh for Wretchedness, yet shun the Wretched,
Nursing in some delicious solitude
Their slothful loves and dainty sympathies!
I therefore go, and join head, heart, and hand,
Active and firm, to fight the bloodless fight
Of Science, Freedom, and the Truth in Christ.
 Yet oft when after honourable toil
 Rests the tir’d mind, and waking loves to dream,
 My spirit shall revisit thee, dear Cot!
 Thy Jasmin and thy window-peeping Rose,
 And Myrtles fearless of the mild sea-air.
 And I shall sigh fond wishes--sweet Abode!
 Ah!--had none greater! And that all had such!
 It might be so--but the time is not yet.
 Speed it, O Father! Let thy Kingdom come!","The author lived in a small cottage in a valley in the heart of the country. He lived with his wife and two children in a quiet, secluded spot in the middle of a stony mountain range. He wrote: ""I was constrain’d to quit you. Was it right I should dream away the entrusted hours with you?""","‘In Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement’ the Speaker considers his home as a place of great beauty and a spiritual retreat away from society. The first stanza describes the cottage in the dell, the second focuses on the view from the hills nearby. The penultimate stanza deals with the Speaker’s decision to quit this idyllic setting and serve elsewhere. It is as though he feels he does not deserve this life of serenity when others fight for what they believe in. In the fourth and final stanza, he concludes that though he has quit this place it will always remain in his heart and he can access these memories in times of stress and hardship."
946,"There was the summer. There Warm hours of leaf-lipped song, And dripping amber sweat. O sweet to see The great trees condescend to cast a pearl Down to the myrtles; and the proud leaves curl In ecstasy Fruit of a quest, despair. Smart of a sullen wrong. Where may they hide them yet? One hour, yet one, To find the mossgod lurking in his nest, To see the naiads' floating hair, caressed By fragrant sun- Beams. Softly lulled the eves The song-tired birds to sleep, That other things might tell Their secrecies. The beetle humming neath the fallen leaves Deep in what hollow do the stern gods keep Their bitter silence? By what listening well Where holy trees, Song-set, unfurl eternally the sheen Of restless green?","There was the summer. There Warm hours of leaf-lipped song, And dripping amber sweat. O sweet to see The great trees condescend to cast a pearl Down to the myrtles. And the proud leaves curl In ecstasy Fruit of a quest, despair. Smart of a sullen wrong.",'Summer Past' by John Gray describes a past summer that contained elements much treasured by the speaker for their divine and natural beauty. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he can recall a summer in which the world was “dripping amber sweat.” Everything was gloriously beautiful and pleasing to the mind and body. There was nothing but “ecstasy” in the environment. The second stanza is more complicated and begins to outline the speaker's quest to prolong the summer. He is searching for answers to questions about the divine and how one is to come upon the “naiads'” sunbathed hair and remain in that moment.
947,"I have been one acquainted with the night.
I have walked out in rain—and back in rain.
I have outwalked the furthest city light.

I have looked down the saddest city lane.
I have passed by the watchman on his beat
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.

I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
When far away an interrupted cry
Came over houses from another street,

But not to call me back or say good-bye;
And further still at an unearthly height,
One luminary clock against the sky

Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right. 
I have been one acquainted with the night.","I have been one acquainted with the night.

This speaker could easily be Frost, especially since the poet dealt with depression in his adult life. In this poem, the speaker tells his readers that he knows the night well. It is during the night that he has taken many long walks, even when it has been raining. He has walked past other people, never meeting their gaze because he does not want to have to explain why he is out walking alone in the middle of the night. The speaker repeats the first line of the poem as he ends his thoughts, “I have been one acquainted with the night.”"
948,"We, this people, on a small and lonely planet Traveling through casual space Past aloof stars, across the way of indifferent suns To a destination where all signs tell us It is possible and imperative that we learn A brave and startling truth And when we come to it To the day of peacemaking When we release our fingers From fists of hostility And allow the pure air to cool our palms When we come to it When the curtain falls on the minstrel show of hate And faces sooted with scorn are scrubbed clean When battlefields and coliseum No longer rake our unique and particular sons and daughters Up with the bruised and bloody grass To lie in identical plots in foreign soil When the rapacious storming of the churches The screaming racket in the temples have ceased When the pennants are waving gaily When the banners of the world tremble Stoutly in the good, clean breeze When we come to it When we let the rifles fall from our shoulders And children dress their dolls in flags of truce When land mines of death have been removed And the aged can walk into evenings of peace When religious ritual is not perfumed By the incense of burning flesh And childhood dreams are not kicked awake By nightmares of abuse When we come to it Then we will confess that not the Pyramids With their stones set in mysterious perfection Nor the Gardens of Babylon Hanging as eternal beauty In our collective memory Not the Grand Canyon Kindled into delicious color By Western sunsets Nor the Danube, flowing its blue soul into Europe Not the sacred peak of Mount Fuji Stretching to the Rising Sun Neither Father Amazon nor Mother Mississippi who, without favor, Nurture all creatures in the depths and on the shores These are not the only wonders of the world When we come to it We, this people, on this minuscule and kithless globe Who reach daily for the bomb, the blade and the dagger Yet who petition in the dark for tokens of peace We, this people on this mote of matter In whose mouths abide cankerous words Which challenge our very existence Yet out of those same mouths Come songs of such exquisite sweetness That the heart falters in its labor And the body is quieted into awe We, this people, on this small and drifting planet Whose hands can strike with such abandon That in a twinkling, life is sapped from the living Yet those same hands can touch with such healing, irresistible tenderness That the haughty neck is happy to bow And the proud back is glad to bend Out of such chaos, of such contradiction We learn that we are neither devils nor divines When we come to it We, this people, on this wayward, floating body Created on this earth, of this earth Have the power to fashion for this earth A climate where every man and every woman Can live freely without sanctimonious piety Without crippling fear When we come to it We must confess that we are the possible We are the miraculous, the true wonder of this world That is when, and only when We come to it.","We, this people, on a small and lonely planet Traveling through casual space Past aloof stars, across the way of indifferent suns To a destination where all signs tell us It is possible and imperative that we learn A brave and startling truth.

The poem begins with the speaker alluding to a “truth” that humanity will eventually arrive at. As we fly, small and lonely, throughout the universe, we exhibit our worst and best characteristics. The speaker describes how humanity is capable of acts of extreme cruelty and of creating experiences of the utmost beauty. We are reaching for weapons at the same time that we are providing tender care and creating elevating artistic compositions. The speaker sees a world that will eventually come into being after humanity reaches the “brave and startling truth” of the title. It will be free of war, racism, fear, and hatred. It is one in which people live and die peacefully, children are free of the nightmares of abuse, our sons and daughters are not buried in identical unmarked graves in foreign lands, and all races are treated equally. The speaker concludes by saying that it is only when humanity realizes its full potential, that we are the true wonder of the world, that we will be capable of crafting such an existence."

This poem is told from the perspective of British infantry who was in face-to-face combat with the Mahdist forces. Throughout this piece, the speaker goes on to describe their cunningness and strategies that led them to break the square. It is not that they defeated the British forces. But, the damage they caused to the reputation of the English military was paramount. For this reason, in each stanza, the poetic voice praises them. Whatsoever, their sudden success did not lead them to victory. According to the speaker, they had won the battle but the way “fuzzy-wuzzy” fought is worth mentioning."
950,"A wind is ruffling the tawny pelt
Of Africa. Kikuyu, quick as flies,
Batten upon the bloodstreams of the veldt.
Corpses are scattered through a paradise.
Only the worm, colonel of carrion, cries:
""Waste no compassion on these separate dead!""
Statistics justify and scholars seize
The salients of colonial policy.
What is that to the white child hacked in bed?
To savages, expendable as Jews?

Threshed out by beaters, the long rushes break
In a white dust of ibises whose cries
Have wheeled since civilization's dawn
From the parched river or beast-teeming plain.
The violence of beast on beast is read
As natural law, but upright man
Seeks his divinity by inflicting pain.
Delirious as these worried beasts, his wars
Dance to the tightened carcass of a drum,
While he calls courage still that native dread
Of the white peace contracted by the dead.

Again brutish necessity wipes its hands
Upon the napkin of a dirty cause, again
A waste of our compassion, as with Spain,

I who am poisoned with the blood of both,
Where shall I turn, divided to the vein?
I who have cursed
The drunken officer of British rule, how choose
Between this Africa and the English tongue I love?

How can I turn from Africa and live?","A wind is ruffling the tawny pelt of Africa. The violence of beast on beast is read as natural law, but upright manSeeks his divinity by inflicting pain.

It is presented in two stanzas one consisting of twenty-one lines the other consisting of eleven. It does not follow a strict rhyming pattern, although end rhymes feature prominently throughout the poem. The effect of this is that the poem has a stilted, disjointed feel which mirrors the feelings expressed within the poem. The rhythm is also inconsistent, although the line lengths are similar the beats in each line alter which again adds to the sense of discord. The poem is deeply rooted in Africa. The language used helps to make the poem feel culturally African."

They continue on, professing their faith in the artist to do justice to their portrait. The next section of 'The Arnolfini Marriage' focuses on the “we” in the relationship. They love the fact that they are able to be with and support one another. They challenge the reader to see if they have a similar dynamic in their own lives. You can listen to the full poem here."
952,"Deities!
Inexorable revealers,
Give me strength to endure
The gifts of the Muses,
Daughters of Memory.
When the sky is blue as Minerva's eyes
Let me stand unshaken;
When the sea sings to the rising sun
Let me be unafraid;
When the meadow lark falls like a meteor
Through the light of afternoon,
An unloosened fountain of rapture,
Keep my heart from spilling
Its vital power;
When at the dawn
The dim souls of crocuses hear the calls
Of waking birds,
Give me to live but master the loveliness.
Keep my eyes unharmed from splendors
Unveiled by you,
And my ears at peace
Filled no less with the music
Of Passion and Pain, growth and change.
But O ye sacred and terrible powers,
Reckless of my mortality,
Strengthen me to behold a face,
To know the spirit of a beloved one
Yet to endure, yet to dare!","Deities!                Inexorable revealers,ural give me strength to endure.                The gifts of the Muses,                Daughters of Memory.                When the sky is blue as Minerva's eyes,                Let me stand unshaken.                Keep my eyes unharmed from splendorsUnveiled by you,                Filled no less with the music of Passion and Pain, growth and change.","'Inexorable Deities' by Edgar Lee Masters is made up of one speaker's plea that he be given the power to look on the beauty of the world without being overwhelmed. The speaker begins this poem by asking the gods that he is given the power to “endure” the gifts he has been given by the “Muses.” This gift, although not explicitly stated, is most likely a literary one. He continues on to describe a number of instances he wants to be able to witness and depict without shying away from or weakening. These include the sight of a bird falling through the sky, as well as moments where the sky is as blue as “Minerva's eyes.” In the last section, he reiterated his previous requests and elaborates on why this is so important to him. He wishes to be able to live a life taking full advantage of the gifts he was given as well as one which is filled with love."
953,"Utrillo on the wall. A nun is climbing
Steps in Montmartre. We patients sit below.
It is as if a scream were opened wide,
A mouth demanding everyone to listen.
Too many people cry, too many hide
And stare into themselves. I am afraid.
There are no life-belts here on which to fasten.
The only hope is visitors will come
And talk of other things than our disease …
So much is stagnant and yet nothing dies.","So much is stagnant and yet nothing dies. Too many people cry, too many hide and stare into themselves. There are no life-belts here on which to fasten. The only hope is visitors will come and talk of other things than our disease. It is as if a scream were opened wide, a mouth demanding everyone to listen.","As we read through the very first sentence of the poem, we find the speaker describing the paintings hanging on the walls of the psychiatric hospital waiting room where the poet was admitted. The painting of Utrillo, a French painter (whose specialization was cityscapes), was hanging on the wall, while Montmartre is a large hill situated in France. With the presentation of this scene of the mental hospital sitting room, the poet may want to tell us that the mental hospitals are not as we think or imagine of them. However, on the other hand, with the presentation of paintings in the very first two lines of the poem, the poet may also want to describe the desolation of the waiting room. The poet in the following two lines says that the waiting room is itself like a “scream were opened wide” and “a mouth demanding everyone to listen,” which may mean to indicate the desperation rampant in the atmosphere of the mental hospital. Too many people cry, too many hide And stare into themselves. Besides, the poet may also be talking about the typical desperation of psychiatric illnesses, which want others to know about it and is often found vocal about it. You must have seen a number of poems who knows how to vent out their misery, but there are also people who, dissimilar to the former ones, “hide” all of their grudge and problems, remain confined to themselves, and also keep themselves 'engrossed' into themselves, without talking and sharing with anyone else around them. I am afraid. The speaker says that she is afraid. And this fear may be because of the illness she is facing, or it could also be because of the effect of the atmosphere of that mental hospital room where the speaker has been seeing misery all around since she has come here. There are no life-belts here on which to fasten. The poet further says that the mental illness is very dangerous. It may not kill a person, but it does rot him/her to such an extent that he/she wishes to die having seen the mental agony of psychiatric patients. The poet says the patients don't even have any sort of protection or life belt whereon the patients or the poet can lean and vent out her misery. So, the disease of mental illness is so dangerous and tormenting that there is no escape from it unless it is properly and regularly treated. But it still leaves its symptoms imprints. There are no life-belts here on which to fasten. (…) And talk of other things than our disease … In this extract of A Mental Hospital Sitting-Room, the poet says that the psychiatric patients are, therefore, only left with the visiting hope of their near and dear ones who keep making visits to them, and ask about their mental condition. But all this looks futile when the visitors don't talk about their illness. They just come to such a hospital to either chat or pass their time as a formality. However, it doesn't give them any mental relief, rather their mental illness becomes more devastating due to the changed attitude of their near and dear ones. So much is stagnant and yet nothing dies. The above concluding line of the poem consists of the gist of the poem and tells us what it means to be a psychiatric patient and that too in a mental hospital which is stuffed with a lot of psychiatric patients, but we must not forget here that there are many people who have benefitted through it. The poet says that the misery of mental illness is stagnant in the sense that it feeds on itself ad nothing fresh is included to it. What most trouble the poet is that a disturbed mind doesn't recover soon; rather it takes time and continues treatment. Though it is not a fatal disease, yet it may rot the person by being disintegrating and still. The speaker says: “So much is stagnant and yet nothing dies.”"
954,"utside the green velvet sitting room
white roses bloom after rain.
They hold water and sunlight
like cups of fine white china.

Within the boy who sleeps in my care
in the big chair the cold bloom
opens at terrible speed
and the splinter of ice moves

in his blood as he stirs in the chair.
Remembering me he smiles
politely, gritting his teeth
in silence on pain's red blaze.

A stick man in the ashes, his fires
die back. He is spars and springs.
He can talk again, gather
his cat to his bones. She springs

with a small cry in her throat, kneading
with diamond paws his dry
as tinder flesh. The least spark
of pain will burn him like straw.

The sun carelessly shines after rain.
The cat tracks thrushes in sweet
dark soil. And without concern
the rose outlives the child.","utside the green velvet sitting room                white roses bloom after rain.                They hold water and sunlight                like cups of fine white china.                A stick man in the ashes, his fires die back.

The poet begins this piece by describing the setting. There are white roses outside the window, and inside is a dying boy who is in a great deal of pain. So much pain that even his beloved cat hurts him, without meaning to, by kneading his extremely sensitive skin. The child dies in the final stanza and is outlived by the white roses outside the room."
955,"At the instant of drowning he invoked the three sisters. 
It was a mistake, an aberration, to cry out for
Life everlasting. 

He came up like a cork and back to the river-bank,
Put on his clothes in reverse order,
Returned to the house. 

He suffered the enormous agonies of passion
Writing poems from the end backwards,
Brushing away tears that had not yet fallen.

Loving her wildly as the day regressed towards morning
He watched her swinging in the garden, growing younger, 
Bare-foot, straw-hatted. 

And when she was gone and the house and the swing and daylight
There was an instant’s pause before it began all over,
The reel unrolling towards the river.","At the instant of drowning he invoked the three sisters.

He wrote poems from the end backwards, brushing away tears that had not yet fallen.","'The Three Fates' by Rosemary Dobson describes the life of a man who is forced to live through the same events, in reverse, for eternity. The poem begins with the speaker stating that the main character is on the verge of death. He is in the water of a river and is about to drown. The man calls out to the “sisters” or the three Fates, asking them to save him. They do so, but not without forcing him to pay a terrible price. When the man emerges from the water his life resumes in reverse. He puts his clothes on backward, returns to his home, and is forced to watch his true love grow younger and younger. His life is falling apart, and there's nothing he can do about it. He can't even write poetry from beginning to end and his tears fall before he feels sadness. In the final lines of the piece, it becomes clear that this is not a one-time occurrence. The man has been granted eternal life, but only for this one specific period of time. When he reaches the end, or beginning, of his life, everything returns to the moment before he fell into the river, and it all begins again."
956,"Light breaks where no sun shines;
Where no sea runs, the waters of the heart
Push in their tides;
And, broken ghosts with glow-worms in their heads,
The things of light
File through the flesh where no flesh decks the bones.

A candle in the thighs
Warms youth and seed and burns the seeds of age;
Where no seed stirs,
The fruit of man unwrinkles in the stars,
Bright as a fig;
Where no wax is, the candle shows its hairs.

Dawn breaks behind the eyes;
From poles of skull and toe the windy blood
Slides like a sea;
Nor fenced, nor staked, the gushers of the sky
Spout to the rod
Divining in a smile the oil of tears.

Night in the sockets rounds,
Like some pitch moon, the limit of the globes;
Day lights the bone;
Where no cold is, the skinning gales unpin
The winter's robes;
The film of spring is hanging from the lids.

Light breaks on secret lots,
On tips of thought where thoughts smell in the rain;
When logics dies,
The secret of the soil grows through the eye,
And blood jumps in the sun;
Above the waste allotments the dawn halts.","Light breaks where no sun shines, where no sea runs, the waters of the heart push in their tides. A candle in the thighs warms youth and seed and burns the seeds of age. The fruit of man unwrinkles in the stars, the secret of the soil grows through the eye.","“Light Breaks Where No Sun Shines” describes the effect of hope that springs in a place where there is total hopelessness. Firstly, the promise of faith lets the heart swell with life and strength. Secondly, it brings focus to a person's broken mind. And thirdly, it gives energy even to bones that have no flesh. Hope brings life to a lifeless body. Like light in a dark place, and water in a dry land, hopefulness brings the power to live and fight in life. Hope shines like a candle that never melts. It brings energy to the young heart. Hope drives away the seeds of old age. It brings fertility to a place of sterility. Hope lets man reach the stars and shine brightly. Faith brings hope and it rises like the morning sun in one's eyes. When it does, the blood of strength flows like a sea. Like the sun rays from the sky, hope gushes like smiles and tears without barriers. Hope comes like day to dark moon-like eyes. It brings warmth to a cold place. It chases doubts and lets promise appear in the eyes. Even when the future is hidden, and even when doubtful thoughts spread, and even when logic fails, hope appears at the tip and lets the future take shape. Hope springs through the eyes and gives strength like the sun rising over a wasteland. Thus, Dylan Thomas describes the power of hope in human life."
957,"I am from a life filled with colour,

From the chocolate brown that is my skin.

I am from the sunshine yellow of my mother’s laugh,

From the red and white of my brother’s favourite football shirt.

I am from the crisp new white pages of a book,

From the miserable grey of the street I live on.

I am from green, pink and yellow; My garden in summer filled

with flowers,

From the terrifying black of the nightmares that haunt me.

I am from the ginger orange of my buried cat,

From the blue and gold of my ever-short school tie.

I am from the dark oak of my grandmother’s coffin,

From the golden “Aum” pendant around my neck..

I am from every pink scar etched into my body,

From the red, orange and brown of a hot curry.

I am from every identical colour of the twins I love,

From the blue and green of a hospital ward.

I am from all that has happened,

And all that will be.","I am from a life filled with colour, says the song. I am from green, pink and yellow; My garden in summer filled with flowers, he writes. I'm from the ginger orange of my buried cat, and the blue and gold of my ever-short school tie.","'Where I'm From' by Melanie Poonai looks at the poet's background through the important sights and experiences of her youth. The poem takes the reader through a series of images that set out a larger picture of Poonai's childhood and what made her who she was when she wrote this poem. She depicts herself as originating from images based on colour. Such as that representing her mother's laugh, her nightmares, her grandmother's coffin, and the flowers in her garden. She is all these things, everything she didn't mention, and everything that has yet to happen to her."
958,"So much rain, so much life like the swollen sky
of this black August. My sister, the sun,
broods in her yellow room and won't come out.

Everything goes to hell; the mountains fume
like a kettle, rivers overrun; still,
she will not rise and turn off the rain.

She is in her room, fondling old things,
my poems, turning her album. Even if thunder falls
like a crash of plates from the sky,

she does not come out.

at fixing the rain ? But I am learning slowly

to love the dark days, the steaming hills,
the air with gossiping mosquitoes,
and to sip the medicine of bitterness,

so that when you emerge, my sister,
parting the beads of the rain,
with your forehead of flowers and eyes of forgiveness,

all with not be as it was, but it will be true
(you see they will not let me love
as I want), because, my sister, then

I would have learnt to love black days like bright ones,
The black rain, the white hills, when once
I loved only my happiness and you.","So much rain, so much life like the swollen sky of this black August. My sister, the sun, is in her yellow room and won't come out. But I am learning slowly to love the dark days, the steaming hills, the air with gossiping mosquitoes.","Dark August' by Derek Walcott describes the dark life a speaker is forced to live when someone he depends on abandons him. The poem begins with the speaker stating that his life has filled up with darkness and rain. There is no longer any sun to drive off the darkness and he is forced to contend with this fact. The sun is hiding in her room, pouring over old happier memories. She would rather not come out and face reality. The speaker has done all he can to convince her, but she refuses to listen. In the second half of the poem, the speaker describes what he has done to try to come to terms with his changed circumstances. He tells the sun that when she does return to the world and drives off the rain that things will be different than they were. She will no longer be the sole recipient of his love but be forced to share it with the “black rain” and “white hills.” "
959,"On a summer morning
I sat down
on a hillside
to think about God -
a worthy pastime.
Near me, I saw
a single cricket;
it was moving the grains of the hillside
this way and that way.
How great was its energy,
how humble its effort.
Let us hope
it will always be like this,
each of us going on
in our inexplicable ways
building the universe.","On a summer morning I sat down on a hillside to think about God - a worthy pastime. I saw a single cricket moving the grains of the hillside.

In the first lines, the speaker describes how she decided to sit down and think about God. It was a great way to spend some time and it allowed her to observe a cricket moving grain from the hillside, one piece at a time. This monumental task captures her attention and inspires her to compare it to the best way human beings can live their own lives, working on small tasks, one at a time to build the universe."
960,"Under my window-ledge the waters race,
Otters below and moor-hens on the top,
Run for a mile undimmed in Heaven's face
Then darkening through 'dark' Raftery's 'cellar' drop,
Run underground, rise in a rocky place
In Coole demesne, and there to finish up
Spread to a lake and drop into a hole.
What's water but the generated soul?

Upon the border of that lake's a wood
Now all dry sticks under a wintry sun,
And in a copse of beeches there I stood,
For Nature's pulled her tragic buskin on
And all the rant's a mirror of my mood:
At sudden thunder of the mounting swan
I turned about and looked where branches break
The glittering reaches of the flooded lake.

Another emblem there! That stormy white
But seems a concentration of the sky;
And, like the soul, it sails into the sight
And in the morning's gone, no man knows why;
And is so lovely that it sets to right
What knowledge or its lack had set awry,
So atrogantly pure, a child might think
It can be murdered with a spot of ink.

Sound of a stick upon the floor, a sound
From somebody that toils from chair to chair;
Beloved books that famous hands have bound,
Old marble heads, old pictures everywhere;
Great rooms where travelled men and children found
Content or joy; a last inheritor
Where none has reigned that lacked a name and fame
Or out of folly into folly came.

A spot whereon the founders lived and died
Seemed once more dear than life; ancestral trees,
Or gardens rich in memory glorified
Marriages, alliances and families,
And every bride's ambition satisfied.
Where fashion or mere fantasy decrees
We shift about - all that great glory spent -
Like some poor Arab tribesman and his tent.

We were the last romantics - chose for theme
Traditional sanctity and loveliness;
Whatever's written in what poets name
The book of the people; whatever most can bless
The mind of man or elevate a rhyme;
But all is changed, that high horse riderless,
Though mounted in that saddle Homer rode
Where the swan drifts upon a darkening flood.","Under my window-ledge the waters race, with moor-hens on the top, and run for a mile undimmed in Heaven's face.

The poem takes the reader through the scenery of Coole Park and Ballylee, connecting the natural landscapes to the changing face of Ireland as a whole. Yeats, who is very likely the speaker in the poem, expresses his sadness over the changes he sees happening and the loss of better times, more romantic (and Romantic), times. The details in this poem are vague and specific. He references rooms, experiences, and sights that are very clear in his own mind but combined together to form a landscape of emotion for the reader to interpret."

This poem is all about what a child should not say to his or her mother on mother's day. If one doesn't want to make their mother sad, they have to follow the poet's suggestions. First of all, they have to eat the vegetables such as carrots, celery, bean, and beet. They can nag on other days. But, on mother's day, it's a must. Thereafter, they should not say that smoking is cool or they have dropped out of school. Moreover, if they have mistakenly drowned a cat, they should avoid telling their mother about that. Interestingly, if someone's mother looks fat, a child should not remind her mother about the fact. Lastly, the poet says if they want to be a poet like him, they must not say it aloud on mother's day."
962,"Ah, did you once see Shelley plain,
And did he stop and speak to you?
And did you speak to him again?

And you are living after,

My starting moves your laughter!
I crossed a moor, with a name of its own
And a certain use in the world no doubt,
Yet a hand's-breadth of it shines alone

And there I put inside my breast

In the four stanzas of 'Memorabilia', the poet describes meeting someone who met Percy Bysshe Shelley and how that experience affected him. He compares it in the third and fourth stanzas to wandering a moor and coming upon an eagle feather. It is only a small portion of a memory that isn't even his own."
963,"The eldest son bestrides him,
And the pretty daughter rides him,
And I meet him oft o' mornings on the Course;
And there kindles in my bosom
An emotion chill and gruesome
As I canter past the Undertaker's Horse.

Neither shies he nor is restive,
But a hideously suggestive
Trot, professional and placid, he affects;
And the cadence of his hoof-beats
To my mind this grim reproof beats: --
""Mend your pace, my friend, I'm coming. Who's the next?""

Ah! stud-bred of ill-omen,
I have watched the strongest go -- men
Of pith and might and muscle -- at your heels,
Down the plantain-bordered highway,
(Heaven send it ne'er be my way!)
In a lacquered box and jetty upon wheels.

Answer, sombre beast and dreary,
Where is Brown, the young, the cheery,
Smith, the pride of all his friends and half the Force?
You were at that last dread dak
We must cover at a walk,
Bring them back to me, O Undertaker's Horse!

With your mane unhogged and flowing,
And your curious way of going,
And that businesslike black crimping of your tail,
E'en with Beauty on your back, Sir,
Pacing as a lady's hack, Sir,
What wonder when I meet you I turn pale?

It may be you wait your time, Beast,
Till I write my last bad rhyme, Beast --
Quit the sunlight, cut the rhyming, drop the glass --
Follow after with the others,
Where some dusky heathen smothers
Us with marigolds in lieu of English grass.

Or, perchance, in years to follow,
I shall watch your plump sides hollow,
See Carnifex (gone lame) become a corse --
See old age at last o'erpower you,
And the Station Pack devour you,
I shall chuckle then, O Undertaker's Horse!

But to insult, jibe, and quest, I've
Still the hideously suggestive
Trot that hammers out the unrelenting text,
And I hear it hard behind me
In what place soe'er I find me: --
""'Sure to catch you sooner or later. Who's the next?""","The eldest son bestrides him, the pretty daughter rides him, and I meet him oft o' mornings on the Course. The cadence of his hoof-beats beats: --""Mend your pace, my friend, I'm coming. Who's the next?""","The Undertaker's Horse' by Rudyard Kipling depicts a horse as a malevolent grim reaper, ever posed to take life. In the first lines of 'The Undertaker's Horse' the speaker describes the horse, the emotions he feels when he sees it, and how no matter what he does it appears to be unavoidable. The horse is always in town, with the undertaker's children at its side. Whenever he sees it he can't help but give meaning to the sound of its hoofbeats. They call to him, or anyone, trying to suss out who will be next to meet death. As the poem progresses the speaker considers the future and the possibility that he might outlive this particular horse, or escape death in some way. This is very unlikely. He adds that no matter what he writes (such as this very poem) nothing is going to change. The horse's hooves and their rhythm are still going to be at his heels, death will continue to haunt him."
964,"The darkness crumbles away.
It is the same old druid Time as ever,
Only a live thing leaps my hand,
A queer sardonic rat,

To stick behind my ear.

Less chanced than you for life,
Bonds to the whims of murder,
Sprawled in the bowels of the earth,
The torn fields of France.

At the shrieking iron and flame
Hurled through still heavens?

Drop, and are ever dropping;

Just a little white with the dust.","The darkness crumbles away. It is the same old druid Time as ever.

The poem begins with the speaker introducing the fact that a new day is dawning. The sunrise brings no hope to the world of the narrator, in fact, the dark is described as “crumbling” as if it has no solid structure. The days of this person's life are monotonous and dreary in the extreme. In contrast to this dark subject matter, a pinpoint of life and light arrives around the narrator's personality. A rat comes out of nowhere and jumps at the narrator's hand. He is surprised to see such a “queer” creature at this particular moment. It is at this point in the poem that the reader comes to understand that this man is an English soldier in World War I, trapped in the trenches. The rat represents an ability that the soldiers do not have. The rat is able, through its “cosmopolitan sympathies” to travel from one side to the other. It can visit the Germans and English without prejudice or fear. The speaker is deeply jealous of this ability and projects his own feelings onto the rat. He speaks aloud, stating that if the Germans knew the rat had touched an English hand or visa versa, it would surely be shot. This is not the case though and the rat, with a “grin,” is able to pass through no man's land. He continues on to describe how the rat surpasses all men in its strengths. It can complete feats that no living man could ever dream of. In the final section, he asks the rat if it is able, through its enhanced senses, to see that all these men, no matter how long they've been there and how much death they've seen, are not immune to it. They still “quake” at the sight of the battlefield. 'Break of Day in the Trenches' concludes with the narrator returning to his darkest thoughts. He imagines the image of a poppy and its melting from the arms of all the soldiers. It is a metaphor for both strength and peace, the war is draining all the good in man. The final line reveals that the speaker is keeping a little of that strength hidden away."
965,"The hunchback in the park
A solitary mister
Propped between trees and water
From the opening of the garden lock
That lets the trees and water enter
Until the Sunday sombre bell at dark

Eating bread from a newspaper
Drinking water from the chained cup
That the children filled with gravel
In the fountain basin where I sailed my ship
Slept at night in a dog kennel
But nobody chained him up.

Like the park birds he came early
Like the water he sat down
And Mister they called Hey mister
The truant boys from the town
Running when he had heard them clearly
On out of sound

Past lake and rockery
Laughing when he shook his paper
Hunchbacked in mockery
Through the loud zoo of the willow groves
Dodging the park keeper
With his stick that picked up leaves.

And the old dog sleeper
Alone between nurses and swans
While the boys among willows
Made the tigers jump out of their eyes
To roar on the rockery stones
And the groves were blue with sailors

Made all day until bell time
A woman figure without fault
Straight as a young elm
Straight and tall from his crooked bones
That she might stand in the night
After the locks and chains

All night in the unmade park
After the railings and shrubberies
The birds the grass the trees the lake
And the wild boys innocent as strawberries
Had followed the hunchback
To his kennel in the dark.","The hunchback in the park was a solitary mister who slept in a dog kennel. He sat between trees and water, eating bread from a newspaper and drinking water from a chained cup. He made the tigers jump out of their eyes and the groves were blue with sailors.","The Hunchback In The Park is ostensibly the story of an isolated, deformed man who lives in a park. It chronicles the cruelty that this man had to endure and makes a reader think about how they treat people and how their actions towards those who are different could make those people feel. Thomas does a superb job of creating sympathy for the poems eponymous “hero” and in doing so really makes the reader consider what life is like for the character and by extension others that are different in some way.

Dylan Thomas combines themes of childhood, adulthood, humanity, and nature. His words describe a scenario that causes the reader to ponder why human beings are the way we are, even as young children. He points out the tendency of children to make fun of those that are different, and the tendency of adults to avoid people with differences. He also uses the man with a hunchback to reveal how people can transcend societal values to be able to live above them. The man who lives alone is able to enjoy nature to create a picture of something perfect. This suggests that the perfection of the mind is more important than bodily perfection. The speaker in The Hunchback In The Park helps the readers to value human life because of the human mind and creativity rather than physical form. The Hunchback In The Park causes the readers to question their own feelings toward other human beings, toward nature, and toward their own minds."
966,"Bells are booming down the bohreens,
White the mist along the grass,
Now the Julias, Maeves and Maureens
Move between the fields to Mass.
Twisted trees of small green apple
Guard the decent whitewashed chapel,
Gilded gates and doorway grained,
Pointed windows richly stained
With many-coloured Munich glass.
See the black-shawled congregations
On the broidered vestment gaze
Murmer past the painted stations
As Thy Sacred Heart displays
Lush Kildare of scented meadows,
Roscommon, thin in ash-tree shadows,
And Westmeath the lake-reflected,
Spreading Leix the hill-protected,
Kneeling all in silver haze?
In yews and woodbine, walls and guelder,
Nettle-deep the faithful rest,
Winding leagues of flowering elder,
Sycamore with ivy dressed,
Ruins in demesnes deserted,
Bog-surrounded bramble-skirted -
Townlands rich or townlands mean as
These, oh, counties of them screen us
In the Kingdom of the West.
Stony seaboard, far and foreign,
Stony hills poured over space,
Stony outcrop of the Burren,
Stones in every fertile place,
Little fields with boulders dotted,
Grey-stone shoulders saffron-spotted,
Stone-walled cabins thatched with reeds,
Where a Stone Age people breeds
The last of Europe's stone age race.
Has it held, the warm June weather?
Draining shallow sea-pools dry,
When we bicycled together
Down the bohreens fuchsia-high.
Till there rose, abrupt and lonely,
A ruined abbey, chancel only,
Lichen-crusted, time-befriended,
Soared the arches, splayed and splendid,
Romanesque against the sky.
There in pinnacled protection,
One extinguished family waits
A Church of Ireland resurrection
By the broken, rusty gates.
Sheepswool, straw and droppings cover,
Graves of spinster, rake and lover,
Whose fantastic mausoleum,
Sings its own seablown Te Deum,
In and out the slipping slates.","Bells are booming down the bohreens, White the mist along the grass. Now the Julias, Maeves and Maureens move between the fields to Mass.

The poem takes the reader through a variety of landscapes. The narrator speaks on religious sites, the people who frequent them and the land they sit on. Through these scenes, a reader learns more about what it's like to visit Ireland the wild side of nature one might see there. All the images are very much romanticized and the people– simplified."
967,"Once the world was perfect, and we were happy in that world.
Then we took it for granted.
Discontent began a small rumble in the earthly mind.
Then Doubt pushed through with its spiked head.
And once Doubt ruptured the web,
All manner of demon thoughts
Jumped through—
We destroyed the world we had been given
For inspiration, for life—
Each stone of jealousy, each stone
Of fear, greed, envy, and hatred, put out the light.
No one was without a stone in his or her hand.
There we were,
Right back where we had started.
We were bumping into each other
In the dark.
And now we had no place to live, since we didn't know
How to live with each other.
Then one of the stumbling ones took pity on another
And shared a blanket.
A spark of kindness made a light.
The light made an opening in the darkness.
Everyone worked together to make a ladder.
A Wind Clan person climbed out first into the next world,
And then the other clans, the children of those clans, their children,
And their children, all the way through time—
To now, into this morning light to you.","Once the world was perfect, and we were happy in that world, we took it for granted. Then Doubt pushed through with its spiked head. Once Doubt ruptured the web, all manner of demon thoughts jumped through. We destroyed the world we had been given for inspiration, for life.","By beginning with 'once the world was perfect', Joy Harjo explores the halcyon days of the past, in which everyone lived together in harmony. However, after the appearance of 'Discontent' and 'Doubt', the people of the world began to turn on themselves. Through violence and the breeding of 'fear, greed, envy, and hatred', the state of perfection was eventually destroyed by man. Yet, Harjo writes that eventually, after just one act of kindness, the world began to heal itself, escaping the horrors into a 'light' future. This restored world of balance continued down through the generations, until it reaches 'to you', the world catching up with the present date."
968,"Gold-brown upon the sated flood
The rock-vine clusters lift and sway:
Vast wings above the lambent waters brood
Of sullen day.

A waste of waters ruthlessly
Sways and uplifts its weedy mane,
Where brooding day stares down upon the sea
In dull disdain.

Uplift and sway, O golden vine,
Thy clustered fruits to love's full flood,
Lambent and vast and ruthless as is thine
Incertitude.","Gold-brown upon the sated flood, the rock-vine clusters lift and sway. Vast wings above the lambent waters brood, where brooding day stares down upon the sea. O golden vine, bestowed with clustered fruits to love's full flood flood, help us to love one another.","Flood' by James Joyce contains a drawn-out metaphor about love, seen through the sublime impact of a vast and ruthless flood. The poem begins with the speaker describing how the “Goldbrown” vines that were once staunchly connected to rocks have been moved away by the flood. They are floating in the water, which has come and taken what it wanted. The “flood is “sated” now but continues to rage. All this occurs while the sky looks on with “disdain.” The next lines speak to the same images. Here the speaker gives greater detail to the “ruthless” nature of the water and its ability to take anything it wants to. In the final lines, Joyce brings the text around to speak about love. Here, the speaker is asking that the listener “Uplift” their “fruits” to “love's full flood,” and perhaps embrace the complexity of experiences that comes with the emotion."

Madhubuti is about a black man who tries to look cool in American society, forgetting his actual roots. The language of this piece confuses readers. To get to the core, one has to read this piece as a series of references to a character who tries to fit in. The sketch of the character appears to be humorous as well as satiric. Madhubuti describes how the person wears imported items and acts “cool”. He is so relaxed that the poet finds it exceedingly ludicrous. At the end of this piece, he starkly contrasts his changed character with his real identity."
970,"Spades take up leaves
No better than spoons,
And bags full of leaves
Are light as balloons.

Of rustling all day

Flowing over my arms
And into my face.

In 'Gathering Leaves,' Frost uses natural imagery and descriptive language to portray the themes of maturity, loss of childhood, and internal value that man places not only on himself but on everything that surrounds him. The first stanza is light-hearted and festive, aided by child-like metaphors. The second stanza is somewhat comedic, wherein the speaker seemingly makes a fool out of himself, making more noise than getting work done. The third, fourth, and fifth stanzas explore the themes of man versus both nature and himself. The final stanza is positive, wherein the speaker ultimately concludes that value should not be universally decided and that everyone has different needs and expectations."
971,"The cardboard shows me how it was

When the two girl cousins went paddling

Each one holding one of my mother’s hands,

And she the big girl - some twelve years or so.

All three stood still to smile through their hair

At the uncle with the camera, A sweet face

My mother’s, that was before I was born

And the sea, which appears to have changed less

Washed their terribly transient feet.

Some twenty- thirty- years later

She’d laugh at the snapshot. “See Betty

And Dolly,"" she’d say, “and look how they

Dressed us for the beach."" The sea holiday

was her past, mine is her laughter. Both wry

With the laboured ease of loss

Now she’s has been dead nearly as many years

As that girl lived. And of this circumstance

There is nothing to say at all,

Its silence silences.","The cardboard shows me how it was. When the two girl cousins went paddling. Each one holding one of my mother’s hands. And she the big girl - some twelve years or so.

In the first part of 'A Photograph,' the speaker describes looking at a photograph of her mother as a child. Through this, she is able to get across her feelings about time and how quickly it moves. Somethings, like the sea, stay the same while her mother did not. The second part of the poem takes the scene into the speaker's own life when she was looking at the same photo with her mother. She recalls the sound of her mother's laugh and how she hasn't heard it for twelve years."
972,"Here is the city—
its worn-down mountains,
its grass and iron,
its smoky coast
seen from the high roads
on the Wicklow side.

From Dalkey Island
to the North Wall,
to the blue distance seizing its perimeter,
its old divisions are deep within it.

And in me also.
And always will be.

Out of my mouth they come:
The spurred and booted garrisons.
The men and women
they dispossessed.

What is a colony
if not the brutal truth
that when we speak
the graves open.

The men and women dispossessed. The spurred and booted garrisons. The dead walk.","'Witness' is a reflective poem that gradually moves through the layers of Dublin, offering both a broad geographical perspective and a deeply personal one, informed by memory and guilt. The opening stanzas create a panoramic view of the city, spanning the mountains and coastline that surround the urban center. This serves to illustrate the scale of the poet's undertaking, as well as provide a contrast to the narrator's later musings, which become more personal. The undulating nature of the poetic gaze also mirrors the poem's preoccupation with identity, which is inevitably a composition of an individual and their environment. Finally, the poem ends with an unanswered question, which challenges the reader to assess their own conclusions about the nature of memory, legacy, and identity."
973,"As I pass through my incarnations in every age and race,
I make my proper prostrations to the Gods of the Market Place.
Peering through reverent fingers I watch them flourish and fall,
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings, I notice, outlast them all. We were living in trees when they met us. They showed us each in turn
That Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn:
But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind,
So we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind. We moved as the Spirit listed. They never altered their pace,
Being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the Gods of the Market Place,
But they always caught up with our progress, and presently word would come
That a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in Rome. With the Hopes that our World is built on they were utterly out of touch,
They denied that the Moon was Stilton; they denied she was even Dutch;
They denied that Wishes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings;
So we worshipped the Gods of the Market Who promised these beautiful things. When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace.
They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease.
But when we disarmed They sold us and delivered us bound to our foe,
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: ""Stick to the Devil you know."" On the first Feminian Sandstones we were promised the Fuller Life
(Which started by loving our neighbour and ended by loving his wife)
Till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith,
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: ""The Wages of Sin is Death."" In the Carboniferous Epoch we were promised abundance for all, By robbing selected Peter to pay for collective Paul; But, though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy, And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: ""If you don't work you die."" Then the Gods of the Market tumbled, and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrew
And the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was true
That All is not Gold that Glitters, and Two and Two make Four
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings limped up to explain it once more. As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man
There are only four things certain since Social Progress began. That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire, And the burnt Fool's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire; And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins
When all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins, As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn, The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return!","As I pass through my incarnations in every age and race, I make my proper prostrations to the Gods of the Market Place. They showed us each in turn that Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn: But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind, so we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind.","'The Gods of Copybook Headings' by Rudyard Kipling speaks on the malevolent nature of progress and humanity's eventual return to basic principles of a good life. The poem begins with the speaker stating that originally humankind was directed by a few tenets of common sense and goodness. At some point though these tenets, embodied as “copybook headings” fell to the side. They were replaced with new gods, those of “the Market Place,” or progress, growth, and wealth. Under the influence of these new gods, humanity went downhill fast. People forgot how to live their lives and the parts that make humanity human was lost. All throughout this dark period the previous way of life, as seen at the dawn of man, still existed. The rules of the copybook headings are lingering close to the human mind, ready for when they are needed. The speaker also explains why people threw off their original gods. They did not provide a magical, externally fulfilling life, something promised by the new gods. As the speaker predicted, the “Marketplace” gods do fail. Humanity is again lost without direction. This is when the “copybook headings” step in and refresh the combined consciousness of the world. Everything reverts back to how it used to be but inevitably, the cycle will start again."
974,"The evening passes fast away,
'Tis almost time to rest;
What thoughts has left the vanished day,
What feelings, in thy breast?
 
“The vanished day? It leaves a sense
Of labour hardly done;
Of little, gained with vast expense, —
A sense of grief alone!
 
”Time stands before the door of Death,
Upbraiding bitterly;
And Conscience, with exhaustless breath,
Pours black reproach on me:
 
“And though I’ve said that Conscience lies,
And Time should Fate condemn;
Still, sad Repentance clouds my eyes,
And makes me yield to them!
 
”Then art thou glad to seek repose?
Art glad to leave the sea,
And anchor all thy weary woes
In calm Eternity?
 
“Nothing regrets to see thee go —
Not one voice sobs ”farewell,""
And where thy heart has suffered so,
Canst thou desire to dwell?""
 
“Alas! The countless links are strong
That bind us to our clay;
The loving spirit lingers long,
And would not pass away!
 
”And rest is sweet, when laurelled fame
Will crown the soldier’s crest;
But, a brave heart, with a tarnished name,
Would rather fight than rest.""

Hast fought thy whole life through,
Hast humbled Falsehood, trampled Fear;
What is there left to do?”
 
“'Tis true, this arm has hotly striven,
Has dared what few would dare;
Much have I done, and freely given,
But little learnt to bear!”
 
“Look on the grave, where thou must sleep,
Thy last, and strongest foe;
It is endurance not to weep,

And break in glorious morn!""","The evening passes fast away,                'Tis almost time to rest;                What thoughts has left the vanished day,                What feelings, in thy breast?                “The vanished day?

In 'Self-Interrogation', the poet Emily Brontë appears to be sad while musing over her death. She can see herself standing in the evening of his life. The metaphorical night is approaching to take her away. At this critical juncture, she asks herself what he has done in her past. Is it worthwhile? The poet cannot decide either. Whenever the thought of death comes to her mind, she finds herself entangled in the “countless links”. It makes her feel that she has still a long way to go before closing her eyes. She cannot leave this battle in the middle. The poetic voice firmly declares, “But, a brave heart, with a tarnished name,/ would rather fight than rest.” It is better to be defeated by death rather than admitting submission. Challenges may come to stop her spirit, but her Christian soul knows, the “glorious morn” is waiting to welcome her in heaven. The significance of the word choice and the sustained spirit in each line of the poem will be more meaningful after listening to the poem more than once."

In both stanzas of 'A Certain Lady,' the speaker admits that she puts on a facade whenever the person she loves comes around. She wants this person to spend as much time as possible with her, so she lets them tell her about the exploits they engage in. This person brags about the women they've been with and is completely blind to the fact that she cares so much for them. She hides her sorrows until after they're gone."

It is about trust and how a child views the trust they have with their parents. It is presented in free verse in four stanzas of varying lengths (four lines, seven lines, six lines, and six lines) there is no rhyming pattern and the number of syllables per line seems to vary giving the poem an uneven feel.

977,"I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.
I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.
I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?

I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.
I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.

At the beginning of chapter five, he responds to that invitation. It is important to note that when the woman invited him to come to “his” garden, she was referring to her own sexuality. Referring to her sexuality as belonging to him shows her eager anticipation to give herself to him on her wedding night. It also shows her lifelong commitment to him. It also reaffirms what has already been implied multiple times throughout the song- namely that she has kept her virginity and is eager to give this gift to her husband at the consummation of their marriage."

The poem begins with the speaker describing the setting. She is going to be telling a story of the old west that took place among the “red, red grass”. The main character is a Spanish man named Johnny who spent his days taking care of his herd and playing his mandolin. He didn't speak to those around him, instead, he sang the “songs of Spain”. Because of his difference, and the fact that he spoke a language different than what was common, people began to think poorly of him. They said that his words were sinful if they were heard aloud. Then eventually, that he killed many people long ago. Unfortunately for Johnny, this led to his death by hanging."
979,"Sometimes a craving comes for salt, not sweet,
For fruits that you can eat
Only if pickled in a vat of tears—
A rich and dark and indehiscent meat
Clinging tightly to the pit—on spears

Of toothpicks, maybe, drowned beneath a tide
Of vodka and vermouth,
Rocking at the bottom of a wide,
Shallow, long-stemmed glass, and gentrified;
Or rustic, on a plate cracked like a tooth—

A miscellany of the humble hues
Eponymously drab—
Brown greens and purple browns, the blacks and blues
That chart the slow chromatics of a bruise—
Washed down with swigs of barrel wine that stab

The palate with pine-sharpness. They recall
The harvest and its toil,
The nets spread under silver trees that foil
The blue glass of the heavens in the fall—
Daylight packed in treasuries of oil,

Paradigmatic summers that decline
Like singular archaic nouns, the troops
Of hours in retreat. These fruits are mine—
Small bitter drupes
Full of the golden past and cured in brine.","Sometimes a craving comes for salt, not sweet, not fruit, but for fruits that you can eat only if pickled in a vat of tears. These fruits are mine. They recall the harvest and its toil, the nets spread under silver trees that foil the blue glass of the heavens in the fall.","'Olives' by A.E. Stallings describes how the olives taste like in different cases and why the speaker likes these “small bitter drupes.” Stallings begins this poem by describing the taste of the olives. According to the speaker of this piece, people can eat them only if the fruits are pickled in salt. She presents a variety of images that points to how the fruits are eaten. Some prefer them having them wine or vodka. While some of us eat them the brined fruit with a toothpick or serving it with other dishes. In the following stanzas, Stallings talks about their color and the emotions associated with their “humble hues”. Besides, she describes how the olives are harvested and the sunlight that packs them with the “treasuries of oil.” Lastly, she makes it clear that she likes the brined drupes which are “full of golden past.”"
980,"It was the first gift he ever gave her,
buying it for five francs in the Galeries
in pre-war Paris. It was stifling.
A starless drought made the nights stormy.

They stayed in the city for the summer.
They met in cafés. She was always early.
He was late. That evening he was later.
They wrapped the fan. He looked at his watch.

She looked down the Boulevard des Capucines.
She ordered more coffee. She stood up.
The streets were emptying. The heat was killing.
She thought the distance smelled of rain and lightning.

These are wild roses, appliquéd on silk by hand,
darkly picked, stitched boldly, quickly.
The rest is tortoiseshell and has the reticent,
clear patience of its element. It is

a worn-out, underwater bullion and it keeps,
even now, an inference of its violation.
The lace is overcast as if the weather
it opened for and offset had entered it.

The past is an empty café terrace.
An airless dusk before thunder. A man running.
And no way to know what happened then —
none at all — unless, of course, you improvise:

The blackbird on this first sultry morning,
in summer, finding buds, worms, fruit,
feels the heat. Suddenly she puts out her wing —
the whole, full, flirtatious span of it.","It was the first gift he ever gave her, after buying it for five francs in the Galeries in pre-war Paris. She thought the distance smelled of rain and lightning. He looked at his watch. The streets were emptying. The heat was killing.","'The Black Lace Fan My Mother Gave Me' by Eavan Boland is a fictionalized story of the origins of a black fan owned by the poet's mother in pre-war Paris. The poem begins with the speaker setting out the most basic details. The fan, which she now possesses, once belonged to her mother. It was the first gift he, presumably the poet's father, gave to the mother. Over the next lines the speaker, who is likely Boland herself, creates a detailed history of how the fan was acquired. She goes into its material properties as well as its construction. The poem concludes with a new image, that of a blackbird."
981,"The sun has burst the sky
Because I love you
And the river its banks.

The sea laps the great rocks
Because I love you
And takes no heed of the moon dragging it away
And saying coldly 'Constancy is not for you'.
The blackbird fills the air
Because I love you
With spring and lawns and shadows falling on lawns.

The people walk in the street and laugh
I love you
And far down the river ships sound their hooters
Crazy with joy because I love you.",The sun has burst the sky because I love you. The sea laps the great rocks                Because I loveYou. The people walk in the street and laugh. The ships sound their hooters                Crazy with joy because ILove you. And far down the river ships sound the hooters too.,"'The Sun Has Burst the Sky' by Jenny Joseph it's a simple, effective poem that uses natural images to describe the intensity of one person's love. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins a series of hyperbolic images that compares their love to features in the natural world. The speaker says that because their love is so strong, the river breaks its banks, the tide disobeys the moon, ships honk their horns, and more. All throughout the poem, the speaker repeats the line “I love you,” ensuring that the intended listener, someone who is only described as “you,” never forgets how they feel."
982,"Happy the man, whose wish and care
A few paternal acres bound,
Content to breathe his native air,
In his own ground.
Whose herds with milk, whose fields with bread,
Whose flocks supply him with attire,
Whose trees in summer yield him shade,
In winter fire.
Blest, who can unconcernedly find
Hours, days, and years slide soft away,
In health of body, peace of mind,
Quiet by day,
Sound sleep by night; study and ease,
Together mixed; sweet recreation;
And innocence, which most does please,
With meditation.
Thus let me live, unseen, unknown;
Thus unlamented let me die;
Steal from the world, and not a stone
Tell where I lie.","Happy the man, whose wish and care                A few paternal acres bound,                Content to breathe his native air,                In his own ground.                Whose herds with milk, whose fields with bread,                Whosing flocks supply him with attire.                Blest, who can unconcernedly find                Hours, days, and years slide soft away.                Sound sleep by night; study and ease, together mixed; sweet recreation;                And innocence, which most does please, with meditation.","'Ode on Solitude' by Alexander Pope is a thoughtful poem about a man's preference for solitude and hardwork over company and luxury. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins by suggesting that a man can be happy if he has a few acres to care for. On one's native and, in his “own ground,” one can tend their herds and take pleasure from the simple turn of the seasons. There is fire in winter and shade in summer. As the poem progresses, the speaker emphasizes how solitude is another important part of the equation. He would rather die unknown and be buried somewhere no one could ever find him than be celebrated and attended to."
983,"What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why,
I have forgotten, and what arms have lain
Under my head till morning; but the rain
Is full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh
Upon the glass and listen for reply,
And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain
For unremembered lads that not again
Will turn to me at midnight with a cry.

Thus in the winter stands the lonely tree,
Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one,
Yet knows its boughs more silent than before:
I cannot say what loves have come and gone,
I only know that summer sang in me
A little while, that in me sings no more.","What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why,                I have forgotten, and what arms have lain under my head till morning,                The rain is full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh and listen for reply,                And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain for unremembered lads that not again will turn to me at midnight with a cry.                Thus in the winter stands the lonely tree.","'What My Lips Have Kissed, and Where, and Why' is a poem told from the perspective of a speaker who cannot remember the lovers of her past, only the happy state she must once have inhabited. The speaker describes what parts of her memory have been lost, “what” her lips have kissed, “why” they kissed, and “where” they kissed. She continues in this way, informing the reader she cannot recall “what arms have lain / Under my head…” The rain of present-day is bringing out ghosts though, and they listen at her window, hoping she will notice and remember them, but she does not. Thus begins the sestet portion of the poem in which she is morning the loss of what she considers, “summer.” She describes herself as a winter tree that knows its branches used to be louder, more lively than they currently are but cannot remember the birds that once lived there in summer. So too has she forgotten who made her happy in the past, she only feels the void. The poem concludes sadly with no hope for the future, she says she once knew summer, but that “in me [it[ sings no more.”"
984,"My grandmother is like a Scottish pine,
tall, straight-backed, proud and plentiful,
a fine head of hair, greying now
tied up in a loose bun.
Her face is ploughed land.
Her eyes shine rough as amethysts.
She wears a plaid shawl
of our clan with the zeal of an Amazon.
She is one of those women
burnt in her croft rather than moved off the land.
She comes from them, her snake’s skin.
She speaks Gaelic mostly, English only
when she has to, then it’s blasphemy.
My grandmother sits by the fire and swears
There’ll be no darkie baby in this house

Her face is tight as ice and her eyes are amethysts. She speaks Gaelic mostly, English only when she has to.","'My Grandmother' by Jackie Kay is a powerful, surprising poem about family difficulties. In the first part of the poem, the poet begins by describing her grandmother as a Scottish pine tree. She is proud and straight-backed in the same way. Her grandmother cares a great deal about family history and heritage, but, as the end of the first stanza reveals, she is also racist and cruel. If this poem is taken as fact, her grandmother exhibited contempt for Kay as a child when she was adopted into the family."
985,"These are the letters which Endymion wrote
To one he loved in secret, and apart.
And now the brawlers of the auction mart
Bargain and bid for each poor blotted note,
Ay! for each separate pulse of passion quote
The merchant’s price. I think they love not art
Who break the crystal of a poet’s heart
That small and sickly eyes may glare and gloat.
Is it not said that many years ago,
In a far Eastern town, some soldiers ran
With torches through the midnight, and began
To wrangel for mean raiment, and to throw
Dice for the garments of a wretched man,
Not knowing the God’s wonder, or His woe?","These are the letters which Endymion wrote to one he loved in secret, and apart. And now the brawlers of the auction mart are bidding for each poor blotted note. I think they love not art, they break the crystal of a poet’s heart.","On the Sale By Auction of Keats' Love Letters' by Oscar Wilde speaks on what the poet saw as a gross violation of Keats' privacy by artistic illiterates. The poem begins with the speaker referring to Keats as “Endymion,” a beautiful young man from Greek mythology, and the subject of one of Keats' best-known works. Wilde speaks about the love that Keats and Fanny Brawne shared in secret and how all their private words are about to be put out into the open and sold to those who care nothing for art. The merchants are going to prosper from Keats' passionate pulses. The second half of 'On the Sale By Auction of Keats' Love Letters' uses the story of the Roman soldiers who gambled over Christ's clothes as a comparison to how Keats is being treated."
986,"After the first powerful plain manifesto
The black statement of pistons, without more fuss
But gliding like a queen, she leaves the station.
Without bowing and with restrained unconcern
She passes the houses which humbly crowd outside,
The gasworks and at last the heavy page
Of death, printed by gravestones in the cemetery.
Beyond the town there lies the open country
Where, gathering speed, she acquires mystery,
The luminous self-possession of ships on ocean.
It is now she begins to sing—at first quite low
Then loud, and at last with a jazzy madness—
The song of her whistle screaming at curves,
Of deafening tunnels, brakes, innumerable bolts.
And always light, aerial, underneath
Goes the elate metre of her wheels.
Steaming through metal landscape on her lines
She plunges new eras of wild happiness
Where speed throws up strange shapes, broad curves
And parallels clean like the steel of guns.
At last, further than Edinburgh or Rome,
Beyond the crest of the world, she reaches night
Where only a low streamline brightness
Of phosphorus on the tossing hills is white.
Ah, like a comet through flame, she moves entranced
Wrapt in her music no bird song, no, nor bough
Breaking with honey buds, shall ever equal.","After the first powerful plain manifesto                The black statement of pistons, without more fuss                But gliding like a queen, she leaves the station.                Without bowing and with restrained unconcern                She passes the houses which humbly crowd outside, the gasworks and at last the heavy page                Of death, printed by gravestones in the cemetery.                Beyond the town there lies the open country                Where, gathering speed, she acquires the luminous self-possession of ships on ocean.","'The Express' depicts the movement of an express train which becomes synonymous with the urgent path of progress. The poem begins by describing the moment the express train leaves the station, possibly for the first time, and how enraptured the surroundings appear to be at the sight of it. As the poem continues, however, the train seems increasingly out of sync with its surroundings and Spender uses this juxtaposition to create a sense of foreboding. Ultimately, the passage of the train becomes symbolic of broader societal change which feels unstoppable, even though it may do ordinary people more harm than good."
987,"Shadows on the wall
Noises down the hall
Life doesn't frighten me at all

Bad dogs barking loud
Big ghosts in a cloud
Life doesn't frighten me at all

Lions on the loose

Dragons breathing flame
On my counterpane
That doesn't frighten me at all.

Make them shoo
I make fun

I won't cry

I just smile
They go wild

All alone at night

Strangers in the dark

With their hair in curls)

Don't show me frogs and snakes
And listen for my scream,

It's only in my dreams.

And never have to breathe.

I've got a magic charm that I keep up my sleeve. I can walk the ocean floor and never have to breathe.,"Life Doesn't Frighten Me' by Maya Angelou is a simple, heavily rhymed poem that describes the fears, or lack thereof, that a child speaker has. The poem takes the reader into the mind of a child who has, or so she asserts, found a way to overcome fear in her life. She repeats the refrain “Life doesn't frighten me at all” several times in these lines. It reminds the reader, and also reminds the speaker herself, what she's trying not to feel. The speaker takes the reader through many of the normal things that might scare a child and dismisses each one. It is at the end of the poem that one might start to doubt the speaker's honesty. Perhaps she is hiding a bit of the real fear she has in her heart."
988,"Come friendly bombs and fall on Slough!
It isn't fit for humans now,
There isn't grass to graze a cow.
Swarm over, Death!
Come, bombs and blow to smithereens
Those air -conditioned, bright canteens,
Tinned fruit, tinned meat, tinned milk, tinned beans,
Tinned minds, tinned breath.

Mess up the mess they call a town-
A house for ninety-seven down
And once a week a half a crown
For twenty years.

And get that man with double chin
Who'll always cheat and always win,
Who washes his repulsive skin
In women's tears:

And smash his desk of polished oak
And smash his hands so used to stroke
And stop his boring dirty joke
And make him yell.

But spare the bald young clerks who add
The profits of the stinking cad;
It's not their fault that they are mad,
They've tasted Hell.

It's not their fault they do not know
The birdsong from the radio,
It's not their fault they often go
To Maidenhead

And talk of sport and makes of cars
In various bogus-Tudor bars
And daren't look up and see the stars
But belch instead.

In labour-saving homes, with care
Their wives frizz out peroxide hair
And dry it in synthetic air
And paint their nails.

Come, friendly bombs and fall on Slough
To get it ready for the plough.

The earth exhales.","Bombs and blow to smithereens those air -conditioned, bright canteens, with tinned fruit, tinned meat and tinned milk.

Although he never states that he dislikes the city, it is obvious from his hateful descriptions and the overall tone of the poem that he despises it. Slough was going through a period of industrial change during the time of publication, with housing conditions becoming more cramped and green spaces being reduced."
989,"One word is too often profaned
For me to profane it,
One feeling too falsely disdained
For thee to disdain it;
One hope is too like despair
For prudence to smother,
And pity from thee more dear
Than that from another.

I can give not what men call love,
But wilt thou accept not
The worship the heart lifts above
And the Heavens reject not,—
The desire of the moth for the star,
Of the night for the morrow,
The devotion to something afar
From the sphere of our sorrow?","One word is too often profaned                For me to profane it,                One feeling too falsely disdained                For thee to disdain it;                One hope is too like despair                For prudence to smother,                And pity from thee more dear than that from another.                I can give not what men call love,                But wilt thou accept not the worship the heart lifts above                And the Heavens reject not not not the desire of the moth for the star.","The poem, 'One Word Is Too Often Profaned', is a short one, and was addressed to Jane Williams, like the poem called “To A Lady, With A Guitar”. It expresses Shelley's genuine and deep devotion to Jane Williams with whom he had a special kind of relationship. Jane Williams exercised a considerable influence on Shelley, and the story of their relationship makes interesting reading. In the poem, he elevates her to a high position and offers her his worship. Desmond King-Hele has the following comment to offer on this poem: “This poem is one of those anthologists” darlings so damaging to Shelley's reputation. Continual reprinting in anthologies has quite mummified it” – deadened it; taken away its life and soul – boredom is the stock response on meeting it again. The poem has a glossy finish to deter scratches, but the ill-mannered cur who does scratch finds little beneath the surface gloss. 'One Word Is Too Often Profaned' is a conceit, like most seventeenth-century love-poems, and may provoke the 'tetchy' rebuke, “More matter with less art”. What this critic means to say is that, though on the surface the poem appears to be shining and attractive, there is very little matter or meaning in it. One is inclined to agree with this judgment, because the poem is really a trifle except for the line “The desire of the moth for the star” which is often applied to Shelley's unattainable and impossible ideals."
990,"My tears are like the quiet drift
Of petals from some magic rose;
And all my grief flows from the rift
Of unremembered skies and snows.

It would crumble;
It is so sad and beautiful,
So tremulously like a dream.","My tears are like the quiet drift of petals from some magic rose. I think, that if I touched the earth, it would crumble; it is so sad and beautiful. It is so tremulously like a dream. I can't help but cry. I'm so sad.","Clown in the Moon' by Dylan Thomas is a surprisingly complex and moving poem that depicts a solitary figure at an impossible distance from humanity. The poem is told from the perspective of a metaphorical clown in the moon. The first lines describe his tears and relate them to a magic rose. They move calmly and slowly down his face, they “drift” as the petals do. He looks down on earth and knows that he cannot go there, he can't touch it. The clown, which should by definition be happy, is at a loss for connection to another person."
991,"We were characters in a story
the writer couldn't bring himself to finish.
When he left us it was late, a child
was crying, newsprint smudged on our fingertips
as if to make of us a mechanism
by which the world would repeat itself, its story:
this happened -- did you hear? -- then that.
So many disparate versions. The terror
risen into words, shrouded there, hanging, so cold.
And the tenderness -- how the words barely touched it,
as if to speak it were a further hurt.
It was night when he left us,
and the child who could not yet remember her dreams
woke saying, where are the toys of the moon,
are we the moon's toys? Outside, lines
of stiff trees stood like hieroglyphs,
the configuration of the one for dagger
so close to the one that stands for shrub,
so hard to understand the difference;
or the one for fear that also could mean
reverence, the one for medicine so similar
to entreaty and to prayer.
And in the distance the red tremor
of the radio tower, and the planes that passed above us
as we held to the earth and didn't understand the earth.","We were characters in a story                the writer couldn't bring himself to finish.

The speaker spends the lines of this piece describing how “unfinished” we seem in a confusing world. They use abstract images that are difficult to piece together while alluding to the possibility and complexity of free will. The poet uses hieroglyphs, in the form of frees, to spell out words that make sense together when one understands the nature of humanity, but for someone exploring them for the first time, they are entirely unrelated. These hieroglyphs represent attempts at meaning that fall flat. The poem concludes with a clear statement about being from and of the earth but not understanding it."

The courageous prurient philosopher has the naughty thumb of science prodded and poked with the naughty thumb of science.,"O sweet spontaneous' by E.E. Cummings is a thoughtful poem that directly addresses the search for meaning throughout life. The poem touches on the way that science, philosophers, and the religious poke, prod, and squeeze the earth, looking for some kind of reason that they all exist. The search for knowledge goes on, but the earth is never going to reveal anything. It is beyond all that. The earth is only ever going to do what it's always done—greet everyone with spring and move forward with the birth of new life and new beauty. Cummings never suggests the earth doesn't deserve to be worshiped. His tone is reverential when it comes to the planet. Instead, he's saying that no matter how much one seeks and prays, no answers are going to come. One should be contented with what plays out in nature."
993,"And another regrettable thing about death
is the ceasing of your own brand of magic,
which took a whole life to develop and market —
the quips, the witticisms, the slant
adjusted to a few, those loved ones nearest
the lip of the stage, their soft faces blanched
in the footlight glow, their laughter close to tears,
their tears confused with their diamond earrings,
their warm pooled breath in and out with your heartbeat,
their response and your performance twinned.
The jokes over the phone. The memories packed
in the rapid-access file. The whole act.
Who will do it again? That's it: no one;

Who will do it again? That's it: no one;imitators and descendants aren't the same.,"In this poem, Updike explores what happens after one dies. Those closest to the person mourn, and memories are recalled, but the saddest part of death is quite possibly the fact that the “magic” that the person took his or her whole life to perfect is suddenly gone. The uniqueness that belongs to each person goes away with their deaths, never to be replicated, even by those who try to imitate or by the person's descendants. You can be read in full Perfection Wasted here."

hanging from his key chain. But,
before that, he had come to boxing,

to that cold house and dinner alone
in the dim kitchen. Perhaps he learned
just to box a stepfather, then turned
that anger into a prize at the Halifax gym.
Later, in New Orleans, there were the books
he couldn’t stop reading. A scholar, his eyes
weakening. Fighting, then, a way to live
dangerously. He’d leave his front tooth out
for pictures so that I might understand

meant taking risks, so he swallowed
a cockroach in a bar on a dare, dreamt
of being a bullfighter. And at the gym
on Tchoupitoulas Street, he trained
his fists to pound into a bag

In this poem, Trethewey speaks from the perspective of a speaker who is the child of a boxer. She details how her father fought in his life. His life was the first inspiration to wear gloves and best out the anger from his heart. Somehow, life taught him the art of bearing pain and fighting back with string fists. There are some instances in this poem where the speaker becomes excited to recapitulate the struggle of her father. While in other instances, she becomes thoughtful to think about how her father held up his body to pain."
995,"It keeps eternal whisperings around

The poem begins with the speaker describing the sea as having the ability to swallow up caverns if it wants to. Powers, such as those wielded by Heaven and Hecate work on the ocean. In the next lines, the sea's gentleness is emphasized. It is able to touch, but leave unmoved, a single shell for long periods of time. The second half of the poem is directed at one specific listener. This person is suffocating under the pressures and troubles of their life. The speaker believes they should take the time to consider the “wideness” of the ocean. This will improve their lives and bring them some relief."

The leaves in this forest do not want the speaker to hurry and there is light coming from the “water flowers”. As the poem progresses the source of the light becomes clear, it is the reflection of the stars in the lake. When the speaker, who has been consumed with darkness, sees the light, she is deeply moved."
997,"My country! In thy days of glory past
A beauteous halo circled round thy brow
and worshipped as a deity thou wast—
Where is thy glory, where the reverence now?
Thy eagle pinion is chained down at last,
And grovelling in the lowly dust art thou,
Thy minstrel hath no wreath to weave for thee
Save the sad story of thy misery!

Well—let me dive into the depths of time
And bring from out the ages, that have rolled
A few small fragments of these wrecks sublime
Which human eye may never more behold
And let the guerdon of my labour be,
My fallen country! One kind wish for thee!","My country! In thy days of glory past                A beauteous halo circled round thy brow                and worshipped as a deity thou wast.                Where is thy glory, where the reverence now?                Thy eagle pinion is chained down at last,                And grovelling in the lowly dust art thou.                Save the sad story of thy misery!","To India – My Native Land' by Henry Louis Vivian Derozio provides a contrasting picture of India in her past and at the present, under the British rule. 'To India – My Native Land' by Derozio presents India as a deity. In ancient times, she was as beautiful as a goddess. The poet says, “A beauteous halo circled round thy brow”. When the poet was writing this poem, India was suffering from British domination. The poet could neither visualize the “glory” of her past nor her “reverence”. Like a chained eagle, she was grounded. In such a condition, the poet tried to compose this verse as a piece of consolation to her groveling motherland. He wished to recollect her lost glory and celebrate it through his poem."
998,"With the frenzy of an old snake shedding its skin,
the speckled road, scored with ruts, smelling of mold,
twisted on itself and reentered the forest
where the dasheen leaves thicken and folk stories begin.
Sunset would threaten us as we climbed closer
to her house up the asphalt hill road, whose yam vines
wrangled over gutters with the dark reek of moss,
the shutters closing like the eyelids of that mimosa
called Ti-Marie; then — lucent as paper lanterns,
lamplight glowed through the ribs, house after house —
there was her own lamp at the black twist of the path.
There’s childhood, and there’s childhood’s aftermath.
She began to remember at the minute of the fireflies,
to the sound of pipe water banging in kerosene tins,
stories she told to my brother and myself.
Her leaves were the libraries of the Caribbean.
The luck that was ours, those fragrant origins!
Her head was magnificent, Sidone. In the gully of her voice
shadows stood up and walked, her voice travels my shelves.
She was the lamplight in the stare of two mesmerized boys
still joined in one shadow, indivisible twins.","With the speckled road, smelling of mold,                twisted on itself and reentered the forest where the dasheen leaves thicken and folk stories begin.

Walcott beautifully presents how he revisits the past. This poem begins in a metaphorical manner. The poet Walcott comparing him to a snake depicts how he looks back on his childhood days. He goes on to present various imagery to paint a picture of his childhood home. The description provides a hint to the financial state of those who lived in that area including the poet's family as well. Walcott mainly describes how they listened to his mother's stories in the evening by gathering around the lamplight. Those memories still make him nostalgic, a little bit sad too."
999,"O were my love yon Lilac fair, Wi' purple blossoms to the Spring,
And I, a bird to shelter there, When wearied on my little wing!
How I wad mourn when it was torn By Autumn wild, and Winter rude!
But I wad sing on wanton wing, When youthfu' May its bloom renew'd. O gin my love were yon red rose, That grows upon the castle wa'; And I myself a drap o' dew, Into her bonie breast to fa'!
O there, beyond expression blest, I'd feast on beauty a' the night;
Seal'd on her silk-saft faulds to rest,
Till fley'd awa by Phoebus' light!","O were my love yon Lilac fair, Wi' purple blossoms to the Spring,                And I, a bird to shelter there, When wearied on my little wing!                How I wad mourn when it was torn By Autumn wild, and Winter rude!                But I wd sing on wanton wing, When youthfu' May its bloom renew'd.","'O Were My Love Yon Lilac Fair' by Robert Burns is a love lyric. Here the poet metaphorically compares his love to a Lilac flower and a red rose. 'O Were My Love Yon Lilac Fair' by Robert Burns presents the poet's desire to be a bird if his love is as fair as the purple Lilac flower. Then he will find a cozy nest in its bosom when wearied. Furthermore, he will sing wanton songs to the flower throughout the youthful May. In the next stanza, the poet wishes to be a drop of dew if his love is like a red rose. He will rest in its beautiful breast and feast on the beauty of the night. The poet will wait there till the sun rises in the morning and fade away thereafter."
