0,"When trees have lost remembrance of the leaves
that spring bequeaths to summer, autumn weaves
and loosens mournfullyâ€”this dirge, to whom
does it belongâ€”who treads the hidden loom?

When peaks are overwhelmed with snow and ice,
and clouds with crepe bedeck and shroud the skiesâ€”
nor any sun or moon or star, it seems,
can wedge a path of light through such black dreamsâ€”

All motion cold, and dead all traces thereof:
What sudden shock below, or spark above,
starts torrents raging down till rivers surgeâ€”
that aid the first small crocus to emerge?

The earth will turn and spin and fairly soar,
that couldn't move a tortoise-foot beforeâ€”
and planets permeate the atmosphere
till misery depart and mystery clear!â€”

And yet, so insignificant a hearse?â€”
who gave it the endurance so to brave
such elements?â€”shove winter down a grave?â€”
and then lead on again the universe?","'Crocus' by Alfred Kreymborg describes the vast darkness of winter and the immensely powerful â€œsparkâ€ which leads the world into spring. The poem begins with the speaker stating that now is the time in which spring and summer are so far in the past that the trees have forgotten they ever had left. The narrator is overwhelmed by the dark cold of the season and wants to know whose fault it is that the world is the way it is. He continues on to speak about the eventual â€œsparkâ€ that will come and set the Earth turning once more. It will set spring in motion, lead the crocuses to bloom, and overflow the rivers with water.","In the changing seasons, a dirge sings for the forgotten leaves. Nature's power defies death and darkness."
1,"Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.","Throughout history, there has always been a seeming fascination with how the world will end. In recent years, these discussions have centered around nuclear disaster, immense climate change, and general cynicism. Two thousand years ago (give or take), the Revelations chapter was added into the Christian Bible, detailing a prophetic vision of the end of the world. This has long been a topic embedded in the human psyche. At some point between the present and Revelationsâ€™ authorship (closer to the present though), Robert Frost added his own ideas to the mix, and the result was â€˜Fire and Iceâ€™, one of his most well-known poems, and certainly one of his most powerful ones. This poem is known for its simplicity and biting message, as well as its call to stop and think, offering a different perspective on the end of everything.","The poem ponders on how the world will end, with fire or ice, concluding that both are destructive enough."
2,"Not in that wasted garden
Where bodies are drawn into grass
That feeds no flocks, and into evergreens
That bear no fruit â€”
There where along the shaded walks
Vain sighs are heard,
And vainer dreams are dreamed
Of close communion with departed souls â€”
But here under the apple tree
I loved and watched and pruned
With gnarled hands
In the long, long years;
Here under the roots of this northern-spy
To move in the chemic change and circle of life,
Into the soil and into the flesh of the tree,
And into the living epitaphs
Of redder apples!","Conrad Siever' by Edgar Lee Masters presents the liveliness of the northern-spy apple tree and the impact of autumn on the surroundings. 'Conrad Siever' by Edgar Lee Masters is a poem based on the theme of autumn. Death and decay features from the beginning of the poem. The poet feels for the withering trees and rotting plants the farm has turned into a graveyard. But, the poet isn't sitting there. He sits under the northern-spy apple tree which still has its time. Winter is not far ahead. Then everything will be changed, even the poet's favorite apple tree. However, at last, the poet feels satisfied with the red apples that he can still enjoy at that time of the year and imagines those apples to be the â€œliving epitaphsâ€ of the northern-spy.","In the barren garden, souls seek connection with the departed, but true life and love thrive under the apple tree."
3,"I don't love you as if you were a rose of salt, topaz, or arrow of carnations that propagate fire: I love you as one loves certain obscure things, secretly, between the shadow and the soul.
I love you as the plant that doesnâ€™t bloom but carries the light of those flowers, hidden, within itself, and thanks to your love the tight aroma that arose from the earth lives dimly in my body.
I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where, I love you directly without problems or pride:
I love you like this because I donâ€™t know any other way to love,
except in this form in which I am not nor are you, so close that your hand upon my chest is mine, so close that your eyes close with my dreams.","'One Hundred Love Sonnets: XVII' by Pablo Neruda describes the love he feels and how it surpasses any previous definition of what love could be. In the first stanza, the speaker lists out a few things that his love is not like. These objects, a rose and a flaming arrow are traditional representatives of love. His emotions go far beyond the physical. They exist deeper and are present in the â€œshadow and the soul.â€ This makes it seem as if his emotions are forbidden or ephemeral. They cannot be pegged down to anything as trite as a rose. The next section describes how his love is going to exist, no matter what. It is like the love one would feel for a flower that is not blooming, existing needless of exterior beauty. In the final lines, the speaker gives up trying to define his love through metaphor. He admits that he loves this person, and that is that. There is no better way to put it.","The speaker loves the person in a mysterious and secret way, like a hidden flower carrying light. Their love is unconditional, without knowledge or boundaries, making them inseparable."
4,"Swerving east, from rich industrial shadows
And traffic all night north; swerving through fields
Too thin and thistled to be called meadows,
And now and then a harshâ€”named halt, that shields
Workmen at dawn; swerving to solitude
Of skies and scarecrows, haystacks, hares and pheasants,
And the widening riverâ€™s slow presence,
The piled gold clouds, the shining gullâ€”marked mud,
 
Gathers to the surprise of a large town:
Here domes and statues, spires and cranes cluster
Beside grainâ€”scattered streets, bargeâ€”crowded water,
And residents from raw estates, brought down
The dead straight miles by stealing flatâ€”faced trolleys,
Push through plateâ€”glass swing doors to their desires â€”
Cheap suits, red kitchenâ€”ware, sharp shoes, iced lollies,
Electric mixers, toasters, washers, driersâ€”
 
A cutâ€”price crowd, urban yet simple, dwelling
Where only salesmen and relations come
Within a terminate and fishyâ€”smelling
Pastoral of ships up streets, the slave museum,
Tattooâ€”shops, consulates, grim headâ€”scarfed wives;
And out beyond its mortgaged halfâ€”built edges
Fastâ€”shadowed wheatâ€”fields, running high as hedges,
Isolate villages, where removed lives
 
Loneliness clarifies. Here silence stands
Like heat. Here leaves unnoticed thicken,
Hidden weeds flower, neglected waters quicken,
Luminouslyâ€”peopled air ascends;
And past the poppies bluish neutral distance
Ends the land suddenly beyond a beach
Of shapes and shingle. Here is unfenced existence:
Facing the sun, untalkative, out of reach.","â€˜Hereâ€˜ by Philip Larkin captures the evolving journey of the poetâ€™s emotional connection to his surroundings. Progressing from urban shadows and bustling towns to isolated landscapes, the poem illustrates the poetâ€™s evolving perception of places and belongingness. In the poem â€˜Here,â€™ Philip Larkin, the poet embarks on a very detailed exploration of shifting landscapes and the emotional fervor they evoke. The poem begins amidst the urban hustle and industrial shadows before steering eastward to meager fields and solitary spaces. As dawn breaks, the scene transforms into a quaint town, where domes, statues, and barges intermingle with bustling streets. This town stands as a curious blend of simplicity and urbanity, where residents pursue their desires amidst the hum of commerce. Larkinâ€™s skillful imagery captures the essence of a world in transition, where loneliness finds its voice amidst hidden beauty. As the poem, â€˜Hereâ€˜ progresses, the urban ambiance gives way to an isolated existence. The verses reflect the tranquility that resides in these quieter surroundings â€” neglected waters coming to life, the air that was weighed down by so many people lifting up, and distant landscapes yielding to the sunâ€™s embrace. Yet, even in this solitude, a stark sense of hope prevails. The imagery of an unfenced existence facing the unreachable sun encapsulates the unspoken distance between the self and the external world. Through its expertly crafted scenes and lyrical language, â€˜Hereâ€™ becomes a poignant meditation on the interplay between changing landscapes, inner contemplation, and the perennial quest for connection.","The poem describes a journey from industrial shadows to solitude, ending in a town with diverse residents. The town is bustling with shops and desires, but beyond its limits, there is loneliness and silence. The land ends abruptly, leading to an unfenced existence facing the unreachable sun."
5,"All the complicated details
of the attiring and
the disattiring are completed!
A liquid moon
moves gently among
the long branches.
Thus having prepared their buds
against a sure winter
the wise trees
stand sleeping in the cold.","Winter Trees' by William Carlos Williams explores the gaining and losing of leaves, watching trees as they enter their yearly slumber. Williams is fascinated by this process, drawing similarities with the human practice of putting on and taking off clothes. The use of personification throughout the poem gives Winter Trees a friendly and comforting sense. The excitement present in Williams' writing makes it appear as if he is friends with the trees, happy to watch them grow and change. The poem ends with the trees going to sleep, ready to pass through the winter. ","The intricate dance of dressing and undressing complete, as the moonlight brushes the sleeping trees."
6,"When it was bitter in New York City,
I would go out with my mother
past the icy buildings, stay
against her, just behind her
so she would stop the wind and snow,
and bury my face in her coat,
just there under her arm.
All winter, like her walk-in closet,
Its yellow light, I would walk into her,
Shake out my raw thoughts.
I didn't know who or what we were passing
or even if the city was still there,
the long radiant hairs against my face
like my grandmother's stole
with fox's head that lay on her breast,
me, clinging to my mortal mother,
our slow progress down that black, warm street.","'Coat' by Jane Duran describes a windy winter night of New York City. The speaker recollects her childhood memory of walking with her mother in the city. This poem shares a beautiful memory of the poet's childhood. She shares one of her memories concerning her mother. While sharing the story, she also looks back to another memory with her grandmother. Whatsoever the main idea of the poem revolves around her mother's coat which gave warmth to her in the chilling night of New York City. Often, when they went for a walk on winter nights, her mother embraced her and covered her with her coat. This scene reminds her of her mother, probably not with her when she was writing this poem. ","The speaker and their mother walk through the cold city, seeking comfort in each other's presence."
7,"Oh, good gigantic smile oâ€™ the brown old earth,
This autumn morning! How he sets his bones
To bask iâ€™ the sun, and thrusts out knees and feet
For the ripple to run over in its mirth;
Listening the while, where on the heap of stones
The white breast of the sea-lark twitters sweet.

That is the doctrine, simple, ancient, true;
Such is lifeâ€™s trial, as old earth smiles and knows.
If you loved only what were worth your love,
Love were clear gain, and wholly well for you:
Make the low nature better by your throes!
Give earth yourself, go up for gain above!","'Among the Rocks' by Robert Browning is an incredible nature lyric that sets an autumnal scene by the shores, and meditates upon one's sufferings and mortality. The poem begins in a romantic fashion depicting a cherishing seaside landscape with rocks, rippling waves, and sea-larks' sweet twitters. With the unfolding of the primary image, Browning's speaker hints at the simple doctrine of human life, which is to accept everything as they come like the firm rocks by the sea. Then digressing from the central image, the speaker talks about her past love. She is of the view that one should try to make their surroundings better by their pain and longings. The suffering in this world is definitely going to help one to get to heaven.","The poem describes the beauty of the earth on an autumn morning, and emphasizes the importance of love and self-improvement."
8,"I am a kind word uttered and repeated
By the voice of Nature;
I am a star fallen from the
Blue tent upon the green carpet.
I am the daughter of the elements
With whom Winter conceived;
To whom Spring gave birth; I was
Reared in the lap of Summer and I
Slept in the bed of Autumn.


At dawn I unite with the breeze
To announce the coming of light;
At eventide I join the birds
In bidding the light farewell.


The plains are decorated with
My beautiful colors, and the air
Is scented with my fragrance.


As I embrace Slumber the eyes of
Night watch over me, and as I
Awaken I stare at the sun, which is
The only eye of the day.


I drink dew for wine, and hearken to
The voices of the birds, and dance
To the rhythmic swaying of the grass.


I am the lover's gift; I am the wedding wreath;
I am the memory of a moment of happiness;
I am the last gift of the living to the dead;
I am a part of joy and a part of sorrow.


But I look up high to see only the light,
And never look down to see my shadow.
This is wisdom which man must learn.","Song of the Flower' by Kahlil Gibran describes what living in the world as a flower involves, from sunrises to perpetual optimism. The poem begins with the speaker stating that the poem is not being narrated from the perspective of a human being. If one does not consider the title, the identity of the speaker is a mystery at first. The poem will provide a great amount of context through its text which will eventually bring one to the correct conclusion. The speaker is talking through the voice of a flower. The first stanzas describe when it is flowers are most active and beneficial to the world. They spreads their fragrances through the air and help to announce the sunrise alongside the birds. The second half of the poem speaks on how flowers are used for different occasions. The speaker says that â€œI amâ€¦â€ used in a range of objects and events, alongside the living and the dead. In the final lines the flower-speaker asserts an opinion that humankind needs to look to flowers for advice on how to face the world optimistically.","The poem depicts the essence of a flower's existence, its purpose, beauty, and connection to nature."
9,"Listen, my children, and you shall hear
Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-Five:
Hardly a man is now alive
Who remembers that famous day and year.

He said to his friend, â€œIf the British march
By land or sea from the town to-night,
Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch
Of the North-Church-tower, as a signal-light,â€”
One if by land, and two if by sea;
And I on the opposite shore will be,
Ready to ride and spread the alarm
Through every Middlesex village and farm,
For the country-folk to be up and to arm.â€

Then he said â€œGood night!â€ and with muffled oar
Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,
Just as the moon rose over the bay,
Where swinging wide at her moorings lay
The Somerset, British man-of-war:
A phantom ship, with each mast and spar
Across the moon, like a prison-bar,
And a huge black hulk, that was magnified
By its own reflection in the tide.

Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street
Wanders and watches with eager ears,
Till in the silence around him he hears
The muster of men at the barrack door,
The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,
And the measured tread of the grenadiers
Marching down to their boats on the shore.

Then he climbed to the tower of the church,
Up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,
To the belfry-chamber overhead,
And startled the pigeons from their perch
On the sombre rafters, that round him made
Masses and moving shapes of shade,â€”
By the trembling ladder, steep and tall,
To the highest window in the wall,
Where he paused to listen and look down
A moment on the roofs of the town,
And the moonlight flowing over all.

Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,
In their night-encampment on the hill,
Wrapped in silence so deep and still
That he could hear, like a sentinelâ€™s tread,
The watchful night-wind, as it went
Creeping along from tent to tent,
And seeming to whisper, â€œAll is well!â€
A moment only he feels the spell
Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread
Of the lonely belfry and the dead;
For suddenly all his thoughts are bent
On a shadowy something far away,
Where the river widens to meet the bay,â€”
A line of black, that bends and floats
On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.

Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,
Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride,
On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.
Now he patted his horseâ€™s side,
Now gazed on the landscape far and near,
Then impetuous stamped the earth,
And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;
But mostly he watched with eager search
The belfry-tower of the old North Church,
As it rose above the graves on the hill,
Lonely and spectral and sombre and still.
And lo! as he looks, on the belfryâ€™s height,
A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!
He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,
But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight
A second lamp in the belfry burns!

A hurry of hoofs in a village-street,
A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,
And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark
Struck out by a steed that flies fearless and fleet:
That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,
The fate of a nation was riding that night;
And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,
Kindled the land into flame with its heat.

He has left the village and mounted the steep,
And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,
Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;
And under the alders, that skirt its edge,
Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,
Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.

It was twelve by the village clock
When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.
He heard the crowing of the cock,
And the barking of the farmerâ€™s dog,
And felt the damp of the river-fog,
That rises when the sun goes down.

It was one by the village clock,
When he galloped into Lexington.
He saw the gilded weathercock
Swim in the moonlight as he passed,
And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,
Gaze at him with a spectral glare,
As if they already stood aghast
At the bloody work they would look upon.

It was two by the village clock,
When he came to the bridge in Concord town.
He heard the bleating of the flock,
And the twitter of birds among the trees,
And felt the breath of the morning breeze
Blowing over the meadows brown.
And one was safe and asleep in his bed
Who at the bridge would be first to fall,
Who that day would be lying dead,
Pierced by a British musket-ball.

You know the rest. In the books you have read,
How the British Regulars fired and fled,â€”
How the farmers gave them ball for ball,
From behind each fence and farmyard-wall,
Chasing the red-coats down the lane,
Then crossing the fields to emerge again
Under the trees at the turn of the road,
And only pausing to fire and load.

So through the night rode Paul Revere;
And so through the night went his cry of alarm
To every Middlesex village and farm,â€”
A cry of defiance, and not of fear,
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
And a word that shall echo forevermore!
For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,
Through all our history, to the last,
In the hour of darkness and peril and need,
The people will waken and listen to hear
The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,
And the midnight message of Paul Revere.","Paul Revere's Ride' by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow is a straightforward and inspiring poem that describes the courageous ride of Paul Revere. The poem follows Paul Revere on his midnight ride. The events occur in chronological order and Longfellow gives sufficient time to develop the drama of every moment. The most dramatic and important part of the plan comes as Revere rides quickly through the countryside from village to village. He's riding with the warning that the British are coming by sea. At the end of the poem, the poet alludes to the historical importance of this moment and how, just like Revere's horse, the facts of this evening will permeate history for years to come.",The poem describes Paul Revere's midnight ride to warn the colonists of the British troops' arrival.
