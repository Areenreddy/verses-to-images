Fuzzy wuzzy, creepy crawly, Caterpillar funny.
You will be a butterfly,
When the days are sunny.
Winging, flinging, dancing,
springing,
Butterfly so yellow.
You were once a caterpillar,
Wiggly, wiggly fellow."	"Now you're transformed, so beautiful,
With wings so delicate and light.
You flutter through the flowers,
Bringing joy and pure delight.

From crawling on the ground,
To soaring in the sky.
You've undergone a metamorphosis,
A change that's caught the eye.

Your colors are so vibrant,
A sight that's truly grand.
You bring a sense of wonder,
To all across the land.

Fuzzy wuzzy, creepy crawly,
No longer just a fellow.
You've become a graceful butterfly,
A symbol of transformation and mellow."

and cockle shells and
pretty maids all in a row."	"Mary, Mary, quite contrary,
My garden grows with love and care.
With silver bells that chime so sweet,
And cockle shells, treasures I keep.

Pretty maids, flowers in a row,
Their vibrant colors all aglow.
Each one nurtured, each one tended,
In my garden, beauty extended.

With sunshine's warmth and rain's embrace,
My garden thrives in nature's grace.
From seeds I sow to blooms that show,
My garden's growth, a joy to know.

So, Mary, Mary, now you see,
My garden grows so beautifully.
With silver bells and cockle shells,
And pretty maids, my garden excels."

Bake me a cake as fast as you can
Pat it and prick it and mark it with ""B""
Put it in the oven for baby and me"	"Roll it, roll it, smooth and round
Sprinkle it with sugar, all around
Decorate it with icing so sweet
A delicious treat for us to eat

Bake it in the oven, nice and hot
Watch it rise, don't let it burn or rot
The aroma fills the air, so divine
A cake that's perfect, yours and mine

Take it out, let it cool down
Slice a piece, taste it, oh so profound
Soft and fluffy, a delight to see
A cake made with love, just for you and me

So pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man
Thank you for creating this cake, so grand
With every bite, we'll savor the flavor
A sweet memory we'll always savor."

To see a fine lady upon a white horse;

Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes,

And she shall have music wherever she goes."	"This nursery rhyme is a traditional English rhyme that dates back to the 17th century. It is often sung or recited to entertain young children. The rhyme describes a playful scene where the narrator rides a toy horse to Banbury Cross, a historic landmark in Banbury, England. At the cross, they encounter a beautiful lady riding a white horse. The lady is adorned with rings on her fingers and bells on her toes, creating a musical sound as she moves. The rhyme suggests that wherever this lady goes, there is always music accompanying her."

How I wonder what*you are!

Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky!

Twinkle, Twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!"	"When the blazing sun is gone,
When he nothing shines upon,
Then you show your little light,
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!

In the dark blue sky so deep,
Through my curtains often peep,
For you never shut your eye,
Till the sun is in the sky.

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!

As your bright and tiny spark,
Lights the traveler in the dark,
Though I know not what you are,
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!"

Noisy little puff-a-train,

Ssh-ssh-ssh-ssh-ssh-ssh."	"Puff-a-train, puff-a-train,
Chugging along, through sun and rain,

With your whistle loud and clear,
You bring joy to all who hear.

Puff-puff-puff, chug-chug-chug,
Through valleys deep and mountains rugged,
Ssh-ssh-ssh-ssh-ssh-ssh,
As you speed along, so fresh.

Carrying passengers far and wide,
You're a symbol of adventure and pride,
Puff-a-train, please take me,
To the sea, where I long to be.

Puff-puff-puff, chug-chug-chug,
With every mile, my heart does tug,
Ssh-ssh-ssh-ssh-ssh-ssh,
As we journey on, in a rush.

Puff-a-train, puff-a-train,
Thank you for this thrilling refrain,
Taking me to the sea so grand,
With you, I'll forever stand."

Like a amp in he air"	"With her radiant glow so fair,
She shines down on us from above,
A symbol of peace and love.

Guiding us through darkness with her might,

A celestial dancer, graceful and free,
A reminder of the wonders we can see.

And let our spirits soar and grow,
For the moon, dear friend, will always be,
A source of wonder and tranquility."

I must say:

Good morning in the morning.
Good afternoon at noon.
Good evening in the evening.
Good night at night.
"	"Good morning in the morning,
As the sun begins to rise.
A new day is dawning,
With endless possibilities and surprise.

Good afternoon at noon,
When the day is at its peak.
The sun shines bright and soon,
It's time for a break and a moment to speak.

Good evening in the evening,
As the day starts to wind down.
The sky turns shades of orange and pink,
And peace and tranquility can be found.

Good night at night,
When the stars light up the sky.
It's time to rest and sleep tight,
As dreams and wishes float by.

So, no matter the time of day,
May your greetings be sincere and true.
Spread kindness along the way,
And may good vibes always find you."
