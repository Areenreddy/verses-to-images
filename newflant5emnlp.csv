witness to this love
in this calm fallow
of these minds,
there is no substitute for pain:
genitals gone or going,
seed burned out,

turn back, and move
by river through the swamps,
singing: a love supreme, a love supreme;
what does it all mean?
Loss, so great each black
woman expects your failure
in mute change, the seed gone.
You plod up into the electric city—
your song now crystal and
the blues. You pick up the horn
with some will and blow
into the freezing night:
a love supreme, a love supreme—

Dawn comes and you cook
up the thick sin 'tween
impotence and death, fuel
the tenor sax cannibal
heart, genitals, and sweat
that makes you clean—

So sick
you couldn't play Naima,
so flat we ached

Harper is a powerful poem that speaks to the importance of John Coltrane's music. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker begins by alluding to an act of violence perpetrated on a Black man in the American south. He immediately describes Coltrane growing up in the same area and leaving for Philadelphia to play music. As the poem progresses, the speaker introduces the reader to Coltrane's creative expression, his struggle with drugs and alcohol, and later, the liver disease that resulted."
1,1,1,"The old sick green parrot
High in a dingy cage
Sick with malevolent rage
Beadily glutted his furious eye
On the old dark
Chimneys of Noel Park
Far from his jungle green
Over the seas he came
To the yellow skies, to the dripping rain,
To the night of his despair.
And the pavements of his street
Are shining beneath the lamp
With a beauty that’s not for one
Born under a tropic sun.
He has croup. His feathered chest
Knows no minute of rest.
High on his perch he sits
And coughs and spits,
Waiting for death to come.
Pray heaven it won’t be long.",The old sick green parrot High in a dingy cage Sick with male,"‘Parrot‘ depicts the declining health of a wondrously beautiful bird in north London, where it appears to have been taken against its will. The poem begins by describing the unwell bird and its view over the houses near Noel Park in north London. The creature’s ill health is emphasized as early as the poem’s opening line. As the poem continues, Smith creates a sense of dislocation by contrasting the bird’s current surroundings with the tropical environment it came from. In the final stanza, the parrot appears close to death, and Smith appears to hope for its swift arrival so that the bird may be free from its suffering."
2,2,2,"The way a crow

The dust of snow
From a hemlock tree

Has given my heart
A change of mood
And saved some part
Of a day I had rued.",The way a crow Shook down on me The dust of snow From ,"The simplicity, in the end, is the key element of the work as nature is shown as magnificent enough to bring a person into a pleasant mentality. It grounds the narrator in a satisfying place, like a “tree,” and this uncomplicated action is mirrored in the uncomplicated wording, techniques, and structure of ‘Dust of Snow.’ Together, these elements solidify the theme of ‘Dust of Snow’: that nature and simplicity, if appreciated and looked into, can be grounding factors in a time of stress."

In the first lines of 'Suburban Sonnet,' the speaker describes a housewife who spends her time practicing a fugue, a specific type of musical composition. She knows that it doesn't matter to anyone whether or not she plays well, but she continues to. There are two children in the room, screaming at one another. This forces her to stop playing until she can quiet them down. Suddenly, another one of her duties as a housewife calls: a pot on the stove is boiling over. She suddenly feels completely overwhelmed, sick, and in pain. The poet compares the woman's happiness to the soap running down the drain. This leads to another personal music-related image. Her children are looking at a dead mouse in a trap, feeling scared despite it being dead. She disposes of the creature with an article featuring bread recipes."
4,4,4,"I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times…
In life after life, in age after age, forever.
My spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs,
That you take as a gift, wear round your neck in your many forms,
In life after life, in age after age, forever.

Whenever I hear old chronicles of love, its age-old pain,
Its ancient tale of being apart or together.
As I stare on and on into the past, in the end you emerge,
Clad in the light of a pole-star piercing the darkness of time:
You become an image of what is remembered forever.

You and I have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount.
At the heart of time, love of one for another.
We have played alongside millions of lovers, shared in the same
Shy sweetness of meeting, the same distressful tears of farewell-
Old love but in shapes that renew and renew forever.

Today it is heaped at your feet, it has found its end in you
The love of all man’s days both past and forever:
Universal joy, universal sorrow, universal life.
The memories of all loves merging with this one love of ours –
And the songs of every poet past and forever.","I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times... In life after life","'Unending Love' by Rabindranath Tagore is a heartfelt poem about a speaker's devotional love for his beloved (the creator or his lady love). Tagore's poetic persona describes how his love merges with all the loves, past and forever. This piece of Rabindranath Tagore is another song in which, it seems, he speaks of his love for the creator. It can also be true that this poem can be written for a lady whom the speaker loves the most. His words reflect his deeper emotions and the devotional aspect of love between two souls. Tagore's persona gifts her with a “necklace of songs” which she wears in pride. He compares her to the polestar that pierces all the darkness of pessimism and enlightens him. Their love is old, yet it renews forever. In her, she has found universality and their memories of togetherness will last forever."
5,5,5,"When trees have lost remembrance of the leaves
that spring bequeaths to summer, autumn weaves
and loosens mournfully—this dirge, to whom
does it belong—who treads the hidden loom?

When peaks are overwhelmed with snow and ice,
and clouds with crepe bedeck and shroud the skies—
nor any sun or moon or star, it seems,
can wedge a path of light through such black dreams—

All motion cold, and dead all traces thereof:
What sudden shock below, or spark above,
starts torrents raging down till rivers surge—
that aid the first small crocus to emerge?

The earth will turn and spin and fairly soar,
that couldn't move a tortoise-foot before—
and planets permeate the atmosphere
till misery depart and mystery clear!—

And yet, so insignificant a hearse?—
who gave it the endurance so to brave
such elements?—shove winter down a grave?—
and then lead on again the universe?",When trees have lost remembrance of the leaves that spring bequeaths,"'Crocus' by Alfred Kreymborg describes the vast darkness of winter and the immensely powerful “spark” which leads the world into spring. The poem begins with the speaker stating that now is the time in which spring and summer are so far in the past that the trees have forgotten they ever had left. The narrator is overwhelmed by the dark cold of the season and wants to know whose fault it is that the world is the way it is. He continues on to speak about the eventual “spark” that will come and set the Earth turning once more. It will set spring in motion, lead the crocuses to bloom, and overflow the rivers with water."

This poem begins with a speaker asking others whether they can find her a perfect partner. Her simple wish deals with only finding a partner with whom she can start a relationship. The speaker is middle-aged and has a son. She is inexperienced, cold, and fascinated by a new beginning. Her partner can be a biker or a gay vegetarian with few friends. She is also a lonely soul and takes interest in music and Shakespeare's poetry. The partner can be an executive who is searching for a bisexual woman with arty looks. Whatsoever, all she wants is a partner who resides in North London."

Then. Every body
I know and care for,
And every body

To a place beneath the chin

The poem describes the images he saw on a fishing trip and his experience with the fish itself. He notes the beautiful, life-affirming sights and sounds in his vicinity and how killing and eating the fish made him feel. The poem ends on an optimistic note, suggesting that happiness can be found through simple pleasures in the natural world."

one-two, cha cha chá—all our knuckles rapping

for a flying sidekick to our bodies’ centers.

My father called you Little Dragon Lee, told me
how you swiveled your hips across the floor—

three-four, cha cha chá—then you both wrote
love poems for a girl in your English class.

I practiced throwing roundhouse kicks as a boy,
feet aimed at my reflection in store windows,

at street signs, at parked cars, everything I knew
I could break. Now, my feet cannot leave

the ground, and I write love poems for the dead.

I imagined it was my father emerging victorious
from the hall of mirrors, my father hustling

on the dance floor, because the last time
I saw my father, he had been waiting for me

the whole day in the morgue. Hold me,
he said, and I did until his body stopped

acting like it was alive. There is no fight
where there is no spark, no wretched cock crow

and a promise to hurt someone. Just give it

an inch between knuckle and breastbone.
It will punch through everyone.", A fight is a fist and a promise to hurt someone.</s,"'Elegy for Bruce Lee' by W. Todd Kaneko begins with the measured 'one-two, ch cha chá' that echoes as a beat throughout the poem. The rhythm is reflecting the steady pace of throwing punches, Kaneko reflecting Bruce Lee's fighting practice. Kaneko discusses his father in relation to Bruce Lee, using him as an example of how to fight, but also how to live life. When Kaneko's father dies, he remembers the feeling of grief, expressing it through the practice of fighting. The final lines reflect on this fusion of grief and fighting, drawing the two images together in a somber combination."

Still, the beloved may stay bitter as an ear

In the first lines of this poem, the speaker describes what a child is like when they're born. They are lulled by their mother's soothing voice into thinking that everything is going to be all right. Life feels simple when one is young. But, as a child ages, they learn that not all lies or mistakes can be erased. The poet uses an example of a scorned lover, called by the wrong name while in bed, whose affections cannot be regained. One simple mistake can ruin someone's chances at happiness. The poem concludes with a very effective image comparing life, or at least some parts of it, to a parachuter jumping out of a plane. One has a single chance to get things right."

In the lines of 'Riposte,' the speaker addresses “townspeople,” a group he refers to as “my townspeople.” He's giving these men and women a lesson in love. He tells them that it is the same as water, air, and poetry. Meaning, it clears the air of poisonous gasses and makes life all-around easier to live. Through the poem, the poet also alludes to humanity's inability to capture and control love, just as they can't control the Atlantic ocean, air, or poetry."

In the first two stanzas of 'The Jaguar,' Hughes speaker describes a few of the many depressed animals that make up a zoo. They include parrots shrieking for food, apes, and lethargic lions and tigers. He also makes sure, within these lines, to emphasize how “un-wild” these animals are, suggesting that something more, besides their freedom, has been taken from them. In the middle of the poem, he brings in a young child visiting the zoo and uses him to draw the poem towards the jaguar, the centerpiece of the zoo. The cat appears to be, by the speaker's account, the only animal that has a depressed representative of its species. Its power is on full display as the speaker alludes to the wildness that still resides within the cat's eyes and heart."

And over the Embankment, where he got lost, again.

In the first lines of this piece, the speaker begins by telling the reader how he went outside one day and found an elephant in his garden. He was shocked to see him there and told him immediately that he shouldn't be there. The elephant was confused but eventually realized how lost he is. In the next lines, the elephant asks for the speaker's help getting back to Africa and the plains on which he should be roaming. The poem concludes with the speaker describing how the elephant got lost after getting to the Thames Embankment. He was then caught by police, tied up outside to a lamppost, and then become lost once more when he wandered off during the early morning hours. In the final couplet the speaker, in an upbeat tone, assures the reader that if they see an elephant on a “Jumbo Jet” plane that he is simply trying to get home to Africa."

In the stanzas, the speaker asks the Spanish needle, a type of plant, if it remembers him during his youth. He has fond memories of spending time outside, near a river, carrying water, and spending time with his love. It's clear he's feeling nostalgic about his past and hoping that through the plant, a tiny bit of himself still exists in the past."

The poem explores the end of love, relationships coming to an end, and how that can impact people. Olds moves through many emotions in the poem, beginning with worry and ending with anger. The poem is melancholic, Olds not quite knowing how to deal with the conversation. The poet's partner is pragmatic, planning their future conversation with careful certainty. The final section of the poem focuses on Olds' emotions, her sadness transforming into anger. This anger is the only thing Olds has left now, focusing on that to try and drown out the pain of falling out of love. She has to adapt to the situation as it is, surprised by things that have changed between them."

a quality of being certain.

In the first part of the poem, the speaker begins by describing herself on a train during a nighttime journey leaving Euston station. She meets a black man on the train with whom she has an instant connection. She feels as though he can see into her mind and her past. To an extent, this proves to be true. They speak, and he explains that she is Ibo or that she comes from a specific tribe in Africa. This is highly relevant to the speaker, who is on a journey of self-discovery. They converse further, and he makes her feel as though her identity is something to be incredibly proud of. When the poem concludes, it becomes clear that the speaker has imagined this entire interaction."

Eliot takes a look into the life of a recently deceased woman who appears to have been unloved while she was alive. The poem details the aftermath of this woman's death. Eliot's speaker discusses the silence on the street and alludes to the lack of mourners around the woman. Despite being her nephew, the speaker does not show any emotion. He is not grieving for her in this elegy, he is simply noting the facts of her death. The strongest emotion in the poem comes at the end when the speaker mentions the housemaid flirting with the footman."
17,17,17,"I wonder how it all got started, this business
about seeing your life flash before your eyes
while you drown, as if panic, or the act of submergence,
could startle time into such compression, crushing
decades in the vice of your desperate, final seconds.

After falling off a steamship or being swept away
in a rush of floodwaters, wouldn't you hope
for a more leisurely review, an invisible hand
turning the pages of an album of photographs-
you up on a pony or blowing out candles in a conic hat.

How about a short animated film, a slide presentation?
Your life expressed in an essay, or in one model photograph?
Wouldn't any form be better than this sudden flash?
Your whole existence going off in your face
in an eyebrow-singeing explosion of biography-
nothing like the three large volumes you envisioned.

Survivors would have us believe in a brilliance
here, some bolt of truth forking across the water,
an ultimate Light before all the lights go out,
dawning on you with all its megalithic tonnage.
But if something does flash before your eyes
as you go under, it will probably be a fish,

a quick blur of curved silver darting away,
having nothing to do with your life or your death.
The tide will take you, or the lake will accept it all

The poem begins with the speaker asking why and how the idea of life flashing before one's eyes came into being. He is mystified by it and encourages the reader to consider the same question. As the poem progresses he discusses how inadequate and distressing this experience would be. He also proposes a number of alternatives, such as a photo album being turned slowly or an essay. 'The Art of Drowning' ends with the speaker discusses one death by drowning and how one's memories would quickly be forgotten. They'd remain at the surface as one's body drifted to the bottom of a lake."

The poem begins from a point of scepticism on behalf of the narrator who is a small child. They do not believe the cosmetic reminders of age on people they encounter to be anything more than deliberate choices, like the clothes they wear. It is only after they witness an elderly person in distress that they begin to realise that age is something genuinely debilitating and they can no longer return to their earlier ignorance of it."

Christ is there as human beings sin and strive to be better again. The final lines are addressed to Christ himself and implore him to continue guiding human beings down a righteous path, one that follows Christ's teachings."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that she knows her partner so well, their face is memorized on her heart. She will go on to say the same about their heart and voice. She has spent a great deal of time with this person, so much so she has neglected the rest of the world. 'Song for the Last Act' works as a mental and emotional stopping point for the speaker in this relationship. She is finally looking beyond her partner to everything fading and changing. The season of summer, a pattern of music, and a ship's voyage all mark the end of something. The speaker does not give a clear description of whether or not this is a happy or sad ending. One can infer from the description of the anchor in the final stanza and the descriptions of fading warmth and music that the change is painful."
21,21,21,"Traveling through the dark I found a deer
dead on the edge of the Wilson River road.
It is usually best to roll them into the canyon:
that road is narrow; to swerve might make more dead.
By glow of the tail-light I stumbled back of the car and stood by the heap, a doe, a recent killing; she had stiffened already, almost cold.
I dragged her off; she was large in the belly.
My fingers touching her side brought me the reason—
her side was warm; her fawn lay there waiting, alive, still, never to be born.
Beside that mountain road I hesitated.
The car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights; under the hood purred the steady engine.
I stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red; around our group I could hear the wilderness listen.
I thought hard for us all—my only swerving—, then pushed her over the edge into the river.","I swerved through the dark, pushed a deer over the edge","'Traveling through the Dark' by William Stafford is a short but effective poem about the death of a deer. The speaker starts the poem by describing how he saw a deer on the side of the road and decided to stop and roll the body off and out of the way. This, he says, could save someone from losing their life. Before he can roll the deer into the river, he realizes that she's pregnant and that the fawn is still alive. This makes him pause. He considers what he's supposed to do in this scenario while the wilderness listens. He chooses to go ahead with his original plan and rolls her into the river."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he knows rivers very well. There are a few in particular he wants to share with the reader. All of them are among the largest and longest on the planet. They have also all played host to some of the most important historical events and civilizations on the planet. The speaker has seen humankind's first moments alongside the Euphrates, participated in the building of the pyramids, and listened to the Mississippi while Abraham Lincoln was sibling down it. The poem concludes with a repetition of the opening lines, making sure a reader is aware of the speaker's deep connection to the bodies of water."

The poem begins with the speaker asking the listener how much they like to swing up into the blue air. This is a rhetorical question, as seen by the speaker's quick response. They love it more than anything and think it's the best thing a child could spend their time doing. In the next stanza, the child speaker describes how when they are swinging at their highest height they are able to see over a wall and into the countryside beyond. There are farmlands and farm animals, all waiting to be discovered. On the way back down they see the brown roof of their home. The descent is dragged out by the long “o” sounds utilized by Stevenson, but once they reach the bottom they quickly escape from the mundane and travel back up into the sky."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that it is time for Luke Havergal to go to the “western gate.” It is here he will leave his present unsatisfactory life and find a new one. If he does cross over, which the speaker believes is inevitable, he will have a new lover. There is a woman waiting for him. In the following lines, the speaker describes a light in Luke Havergal's head. It is blinding him to his correct path. She intends to put it out and steer him to the gate. The speaker makes it clear she has come from the other side to guide him. The poem concludes with the speaker reiterating the text of the first stanza and making sure that Luke Havergal understands that his chance to find this woman is not unlimited. He must go now if he ever wants to be happy."

Lawrence describes the coming of the winter frost and the perilous position it places all life on the “Boulevard.” The poem begins with the speaker stating that the frost has landed on the trees and started to strangle the reaming leaves from their branches. They are cut down, blown away, and buried in the snow. Their “fantasies” of making it through the season are no more. Within the next lines, the speaker describes how the now naked trees are forced to confront the coming season. They are at risk from the weather and know it. In the third stanza, the speaker notices a few tiny sparrows huddled together amongst the leaves and twigs. They attempt to keep warm and serve as a reminder that life still exists during this season. The poem concludes with the speaker stating that all life on earth is at the mercy of the “welkin,” or sky and heavens. There is nothing on can do to truly contend with the frost, when it decides to come."

Vans were drawn up on wastes, women trailed to the fair.

And impudence in rags are lucky.' 'Give a penny
For the poor baby's sake.' 'Indeed I have not any
Unless you can give change for a sovereign, my dear.'
'Then just half a pipeful of tobacco can you spare?'
I gave it. With that much victory she laughed content.
I should have given more, but off and away she went
With her baby and her pink sham flowers to rejoin
The rest before I could translate to its proper coin

As I pay nothing now with the dipping of my pen

And stamped his feet, which made the workmen passing grin,
While his mouth-organ changed to a rascally Bacchanal dance

The poem begins with the speaker talking to one gypsy woman. He ends up giving her some tobacco, but wishes he had given her more, especially after hearing her brother play. The majority of the poem is focused on the sights and sounds around the woman's brother. He stamps his feet and sings and plays the “mouth-organ.” The speaker describes the festivities in the camp as “Bacchanal.” In the last lines, the speaker wishes that he could've thanked the family sufficiently for the way he was transported out of his life and into an emotional, dark, and intense mental landscape. This experience has given him something to write about, and he can't pay them back for that."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that there are those who have in the past made fun of the “one” he loves. This “one” is a patch of land. It is not particularly big, but it is special to the speaker. Others see the farm as too contained and separate from the rest of the world though. It is “innocent” and has made the speaker “innocent” as well. There were times that this thought bothered the speaker, but he always came back to the land in the end. In the last two stanzas, the speaker admires the land he has and considers his own agelessness. His continual existence within this one spot has taken him beyond a mortal understanding of time. Now, he is without age or death. The only way he could die is if he left the land he loves."

The poem begins with the speaker describing the room in which he is dying. He will soon leave it for the “holy room.” Here he will become a music-filled saint, tuned to God's liking. The words he is speaking are used as preparation for what is to come later. He is bracing himself for his own death and entry to Heaven. The speaker describes how there are physicians around him mapping out his body as if they are “Cosmographers.” They are seeking out their own answers and he is seeking the discovery of another world. Death is not something he is afraid of. In fact, he sees it as being an integral part of life, just as the crucifixion was a part of the resurrection. In the last stanzas, he asks that God recognize his goodness and the good he has done on earth through his written works. If God can do this, perhaps he will enter into Heaven just like Christ."

The poem begins with the speaker making two initial statements about what she does and does not want to know about a possible lover. First, she does not care what they do for a living. She does care about their dreams and what their heart aches for secretly. The speaker goes on to add that she wants her life and that of her lover to be filled with the great adventure of being alive. One of the most poignant metaphors crafted by Dreamer in the text is the comparison between the listener's interests and planets. They circle around this person, making up their exterior image. This is a perfect example of the type of information the speaker doesn't care about. She continues on to develop another important aspect of the text, how the listener stands up to scrutiny, loss, and disaster. Her lover's strength mentally and emotionally is crucial. They must not flinch from the “flames” and be willing to stand up to their own, and even her, failures. As 'The Invitation' progresses she adds that she doesn't care about her listener's children, past, or the mask they wear in public. Everything she needs to know comes from within her lover's soul. The poem concludes with the speaker expressing her interest in knowing if her listener could live within their own mind, without the company of others. Their interior fortitude is a deal-breaker for her."

The poem details the impact of typhus on her community as those she cares for suffering and die around her. The lines clearly convey her terrified tone and the fear that she experiences on a daily basis. In the third stanza, she considers whether or not it would be better to die than to continue on this way but quickly changes her mind. She decides instead that she wants to, and her friends and family need to, live to make the world better."

'To A Louse' by Robert Burns is a verse describing a louse and its features. The poet has seen it crawling impudently over the gauzes and laces of a fair lady's bonnet. Bonnet is a woman's hat tied under the chin and with a brim framing the face. Ladies put on this hat as an accompaniment. However, in this poem, the poet finds the louse at once crawling and at times hiding. Sometimes it tries to peep out showing its blood-filled belly and its noticeable legs. The poet talks with it as if it's a little devil sinning the sanctified environment of a church! It is destined to feed on some poor lady or boy's blood, not of that beautiful lady. Moreover, the poet thinks that louse symbolizes the nature of human vanity. The louse in its ugly form proves the futility of one's thinking about oneself. "

A soldier has died, and his companions reminisce on death and its proximity to wakefulness. Images of death and life are intertwined throughout the poem, and the final effect is of a poem that is close to Biblical, tortured, and beautiful, but ultimately a lament on the waste of innocent lives."

There is historical evidence that suggests the act of putting a live bird in a pie was something that really happened. There are records of a recipe calling for that very thing from 1549. It was also referred to in another cookbook by John Nott in 1725. The bird was meant to remain alive and fly out when the pie was cut. Iona and Peter Opie's The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes from 1951 acknowledges a variety of historical events that could be tied to the rhyme. The moon and sun could represent a queen and king, they say, the blackbirds the hours of the day or an allusion to monks. Unsurprisingly, the rhyme has also been connected to Henry VIII and his marriages Anne Boleyn is suggested to be the maid and Catherine of Aragon, the queen. There is no hard evidence for this theory."

The class differences and economic circumstances could not be juxtaposed to a greater degree. The poem ends with an allusion to the fact that the “gulf” shouldn't exist within the United States."

The poem takes the reader through a series of images that set out a world that is less about omens, dead birds, drowned men, and dreams than it is about analysis and photographs. She juxtaposes crime scenes with ants feasting on the corpse of a dead bird in the first lines and then goes on to discuss her personal dreams and what they may or may not say about life in general."

The poem begins with the speaker clearly stating how much she misses her father and how she regrets the hard life he had to live. She describes the ways that her father taught her. These range from how to cook to how to save money for a better future. She closely associates her father with money and banking slips. He was frugal from a young age and passed that trait onto her. She describes his movements in the kitchen and how now, after he is gone, she has taken on his eccentricities, sharing food as liberally as he did and never living the same day twice. Poem at Thirty-Nine concludes with the speaker finding peace in her memories and the thought that her father would be proud of the woman she has become."

In recent years, these discussions have centered around nuclear disaster, immense climate change, and general cynicism. Two thousand years ago (give or take), the Revelations chapter was added into the Christian Bible, detailing a prophetic vision of the end of the world. This has long been a topic embedded in the human psyche. At some point between the present and Revelations’ authorship (closer to the present though), Robert Frost added his own ideas to the mix, and the result was ‘Fire and Ice’, one of his most well-known poems, and certainly one of his most powerful ones. This poem is known for its simplicity and biting message, as well as its call to stop and think, offering a different perspective on the end of everything."

The speaker, presumably Heaney, is sitting at his writing desk, preparing to write, when he hears his father working in the garden outside. This conjures memories of the speaker as a young boy, listening and watching as his father digs in the potato garden. The speaker marvels at how well his father digs, which conjures an even older memory of his grandfather, his father's father, completing the arduous task of digging through peat moss. Toward the end of the poem, the speaker writes as though he can smell the potatoes from the garden and the peat moss his grandfather has dug. He confesses that he does not have a spade like the two generations before him, but he does have a pen which he will use to “dig.”"

They're beautiful, described as brightly shining gemstones living in green canvas. There is also the addition of men in the image. They're watching the tigers who move without fear.

In the first verse, Ashbery's speaker expresses that people have busy lives and miss out on spending time with the dear ones in their lives. He says that someday, they will have time, but by then, it will not matter anymore because life is short and random. In the last two verses, the poet's tone becomes dystopian as he describes how the planets around the earth are “decoration,” which speaks to the peculiar way in which the speaker thinks. Lastly, the speaker describes how the couple completed their trip to California successfully. They can deem themselves as different from other people because they spent time together in California. It is clear whether they did not make memories they would cherish for the rest of their lives. Instead, the memories of living there would come to haunt them. "

But cheerly still; and said, ""I pray thee, then,
Write me as one that loves his fellow men.""

It turns out that it was an angel that woke him. The angel is writing in a book, taking down the names of all those who love God. Adhem realizes that his name is not on the list. So, rather than ask to be added, he tells the angel to make a list of people who love their “fellow men” and put his name on it. Through this request, his name gets added to a list of those blessed by God."

The poem begins with the speaker addressing Sappho, a female poet of ancient Greece, and describing the world in which she must have lived. It was a happy time in which nature was pristine and there was no “doubt” present in everyday life. The doubt that the speaker is describing can refer to doubt in oneself or doubt in one's purpose in the world. This is backed up in the next lines as the speaker refers to the earth as being half worn out by the progress that humankind has made. There is no more need for magic or myths and “nymphs and satyrs” have vanished from the eye of the people. The poem concludes with the speaker comparing Sappho's world to that of the modern age. There is no longer the dedication to gods and goddesses, nor is there the desire to explore the mysteries of the Earth as they have already been mapped. The time in which the ancient poet lived was before Venus, or Aphrodite, was lost from the water, and before Ceres, or Demeter, lost Persephone to Hades. These myths form a before and after wall to the two worlds of these poets."

Silent Noon” by Dante Gabriel Rossetti describes an “inarticulate” moment of peace that two lovers spend within the grass of a pasture. The poem begins with the speaker stating a simple fact about his lover's hand, that it appears to him like “rosy blooms” as it peeks through the long grass in which they are reclining. He can tell from her eyes that she, as he does, appreciates the peace of this moment. They both know that it is not going to last forever, but that only increases the beauty. As the speaker describes their surroundings it is as if everything has been enhanced. The pasture is “gleam[ing] and gloom[ing]” as the clouds “scatter and amass” in front of the sun. The couple has buried themselves amongst the grasses, creating a sort of nest from which they are able to look out at the flowers and plants that surround them. The silence they are existing in is so still, it is like an hourglass. In the second stanza, the speaker describes his appreciation for this moment. He and his lover “clasp” the time they have together to their chests and take none of it for granted. They know that soon it will be over and they will have to depart again. In the final lines, the speaker describes the presence of silence as being a physical representation of the love the two share."

The poem begins with the speaker describing how she chose to pick the pink flowers from her apple tree. This choice changed the course of her life. Rather than wait for marriage and gather her apples when they were ripe, she engaged in a sexual relationship with a man who did not love her. When she returns to the tree, and there are no apples to harvest, she falls into a deep depression. She realizes that the prospect of her having a good life is virtually zero.

The poem begins with the speaker telling his lover, someone with whom he has been in love with, that he wants to mount their head on the wall. This violent statement speaks to a need to destroy, but also to own. It is an idea that thrills the speaker, as it would allow him to take back something from the listener. Their love is not what it used to be, as is seen through the cold tone of these lines. In the second half of 'I am Trying to Break Your Heart' the emotions are more confused. There is some tenderness in his heart. This is seen through his desire to nurture what remains of the love, to put the taxidermy lover back together, and make sure he doesn't lose any skin."

She made love with him, whom she did not love. Rich uses the plowing metaphor in order to describe the act of lovemaking. In the second song, the speaker focuses on the “old last act” or the culmination of the act. She can vividly remember how they fainted together in the bed. She felt as if they shot for the moon during lovemaking. In the end, she talks about how they thanked each other as if they both were invested in a mechanical act, devoid of the emotion of love. "

Eternal passion!
Eternal pain!","Hark! ah, the nightingale— The tawn","The Myth of Philomena Before a reader can fully understand this piece by Matthew Arnold, it is beneficial to read the myth on which the poem is based. The Greek story of Philomena can be found here. To summarize, Philomena was the sister of Procne, who married the Thracian king, Tereus. After being married for a number of years and living in Thrace, Procne wanted to see her sister, Philomena. Tereus went to retrieve Philomena from Athens and on the way back Tereus assaulted Philomena in a small cabin in the woods. He then abandoned her and cut out her tongue. After this tragedy had befallen Philomena she wove her story into a tapestry and had it delivered to her sister in Thrace. Procne, wanting to take revenge on her husband, killed her son by Tereus and served the boy to his father during a meal. Tereus found out what had happened and attempted to kill Procne. The gods saved the two women by turning Philomena into a nightingale and Procne into a swallow. Tereus was transformed into a hoopoe, another type of bird."

It makes you think that all your worth,
Can be seen from the outside.

The poem starts with the speaker telling whoever is reading the poem to remember that mirrors are untrustworthy. They show someone looking into them what's on the surface. But, they have no access to what's inside one's mind or heart. Nor can they see “you” when you're living in the happiest moments of life or sleeping peacefully. One should be wary of basing their self-worth off of what they see in the mirror."

Throughout this poem, the speaker describes the day to day life of a group of people who are living in poverty. The “we” that Brooks uses in the poem encompasses everyone in this speaker's vicinity. No one she knows can afford to spend time on dreams, not when there are much more important things to focus on like “rent” and family needs."
56,56,56,"Yet once an earlier David took
Smooth pebbles from the brook:
Out between the lines he went
To that one-sided tournament,
A shepherd boy who stood out fine
And young to fight a Philistine
Clad all in brazen mail. He swears
That he's killed lions, he's killed bears,
And those that scorn the God of Zion
Shall perish so like bear or lion.
But ... the historian of that fight
Had not the heart to tell it right.

Striding within javelin range,
Goliath marvels at this strange
Goodly-faced boy so proud of strength.
David's clear eye measures the length;
With hand thrust back, he cramps one knee,
Poises a moment thoughtfully,
And hurls with a long vengeful swing.
The pebble, humming from the sling
Like a wild bee, flies a sure line
For the forehead of the Philistine;
Then ... but there comes a brazen clink,
And quicker than a man can think
Goliath's shield parries each cast.
Clang! clang! and clang! was David's last.
Scorn blazes in the Giant's eye,
Towering unhurt six cubits high.
Says foolish David, ""Damn your shield!
And damn my sling! but I'll not yield.""
He takes his staff of Mamre oak,
A knotted shepherd-staff that's broke
The skull of many a wolf and fox
Come filching lambs from Jesse's flocks.
Loud laughs Goliath, and that laugh
Can scatter chariots like blown chaff
To rout; but David, calm and brave,
Holds his ground, for God will save.
Steel crosses wood, a flash, and oh!
Shame for beauty's overthrow!
(God's eyes are dim, His ears are shut.)
One cruel backhand sabre-cut
""I'm hit! I'm killed!"" young David cries,
Throws blindly forward, chokes ... and dies.
And look, spike-helmeted, grey, grim,
Goliath straddles over him.",David took Smooth pebbles from the brook: Out between the lines he went To,"Goliath and David' by Robert Graves retells the story of “David and Goliath” in a darker, more realistic manner in which David does not prevail over the giant. The poem begins with the speaker describing the actions of the young David before the battle. In this short stanza, he gathers pebbles from a stream and tries to gain strength from his previous endeavors. In the second part of 'Goliath and David', in which all of the action is contained, the speaker tells a different story of the battle between a giant and a shepherd. As in the traditional manner, David throws a pebble at Goliath's head with his sling. But rather than knock him dead, the giant deflects it with his shield. David throws another, and another, with the same outcome. At this point, he is frustrated and terrified. He “damns” his weapon and takes up another—his staff which is used in his duties as a shepherd's son. The two come to blows, Goliath's metal sword against the wooden staff. With only one swing the boy is felled. His death comes quick and Goliath straddles his body in an act of domination. This retelling of a traditional story shows that in all situations an underdog cannot prevail. In the real world, that which is not contained within fiction, death comes for those with lesser means."

The speaker takes the reader through some of the many things in life that bore him. He knows he shouldn't say so, but life itself is boring. He takes no pleasure from books or peoples. The great stories of people like Achilles also bore him. It's not until the last lines of the poem that it becomes relatively clear that the speaker is so bored because he's lost something integral to his life—companionship. A dog is used as a symbol of that missing companionship and the mark it's left behind. "

And what did I,"Wild Swans' by Edna St. Vincent Millay tells of a speaker's desperation to get out of her current physical and emotional space and find a new, bird-like freedom. The poem begins with the speaker feeling shocked at the sight of wild swans flying over her home. There is something about their shapes on this day that strikes her. She is suddenly determined to look into her heart and pick out the parts of herself that have confined her. The speaker sees her current life as “Tiresome.” She is metaphorically chained to her daily emotional pattern and would like to fly over the town, just like the swans. By the end of the poem the speaker has decided that she is going to leave the suffocating home she's been stuck in for so long. She is also desperate for the swans to come back and show her again how to fly over the town. When this happens her heart will be free, her old life will sit far below her, and all the possibilities the swans have access to will be hers as well."

The poem begins with the speaker imagining a scenario in which he does not know his listener and they do not know him. If this was the case between them, or between any other couple in a relationship, there is a chance they will “miss [their] star.” One's shot at creating a fulfilling life can easily slip away if the “wrong god” is followed. He goes on to describe how relationships fall apart through the explosion of childhood experiences and the indifferent “shrug.” These things can be avoided if one is only willing to make their own path. The poem concludes with the speaker asking that everyone listening to the text of the poem make their “signals” clear to one another. Human beings should help each other through the “deep” darkness of life."

In the first stanza, the child spends the lines talking about his Halloween costume. He's dressed up as Dracula and is clearly very proud of that fact. He elaborates on what he looks like and what he's wearing. The second stanza is similar to the first, but it goes into more detail about what he looks like, all the way down to his fingernails. Finally, in the third stanza, it becomes clear that the speaker has made a big mistake. He thought the Halloween part was “today,” but it is not actually until next week. This is something that immediately confronts the speaker when he walks into a school and sees that no one else is wearing a costume. He feels foolish and completely embarrassed about this mistake."

'Conrad Siever' by Edgar Lee Masters is a poem based on the theme of autumn. Death and decay features from the beginning of the poem. The poet feels for the withering trees and rotting plants the farm has turned into a graveyard. But, the poet isn't sitting there. He sits under the northern-spy apple tree which still has its time. Winter is not far ahead. Then everything will be changed, even the poet's favorite apple tree. However, at last, the poet feels satisfied with the red apples that he can still enjoy at that time of the year and imagines those apples to be the “living epitaphs” of the northern-spy."

His emotions go far beyond the physical. They exist deeper and are present in the “shadow and the soul.” This makes it seem as if his emotions are forbidden or ephemeral. They cannot be pegged down to anything as trite as a rose. The next section describes how his love is going to exist, no matter what. It is like the love one would feel for a flower that is not blooming, existing needless of exterior beauty. In the final lines, the speaker gives up trying to define his love through metaphor. He admits that he loves this person, and that is that. There is no better way to put it."

He has done something undefined to the intended listener and he/she has not been able to forgive him. The speaker takes on the role of mediator and asks that the listener recall his/her memories of the times they had in the past and find some way to forgive him for what he has done. She also reminds the listener of the love that he holds for her/him and the “plainness” of his feelings."

This occurs later on in the text, but in the meantime, the language surrounding the tree is expanding to describe a specific city in India.

When the pipes are lit and we smoke and spit
Into the campfire glow.

Saint Peter cried: ""Who waits outside them gates so bright and pearly?""
""I'm recent dead,"" the Sourdough said, ""and crave to visit Hades,
Where haply pine some pals o' mine, includin' certain ladies.""
Said Peter: ""Go, you old Sourdough, from life so crooly riven;
And if ye fail to find their trail, we'll have a snoop round Heaven.""
He waved, and lo! that old Sourdough dropped down to Hell's red spaces;
But though 'twas hot he couldn't spot them old familiar faces.
The bedrock burned, and so he turned, and climbed with footsteps fleeter,
The stairway straight to Heaven's gate, and there, of course, was Peter.
""I cannot see my mates,"" sez he, ""among those damned forever.
I have a hunch some of the bunch in Heaven I'll discover.""
Said Peter: ""True; and this I'll do (since Sourdoughs are my failing)
You see them guys in Paradise, lined up against the railing -
As bald as coots, in birthday suits, with beards below the middle . . .
Well, I'll allow you in right now, if you can solve a riddle:
Among that gang of stiffs who hang and dodder round the portals,
Is one whose name is know to Fame; it's Adam, first of mortals.
For quiet's sake he makes a break from Eve, which is his Madame. . . .
Well, there's the gate; To crash it straight, just spy the guy that's Adam.""

With optics dim they peered at him, and pressed agin the gratin'.
In every face he sought some trace of our ancestral father;
But though he stared, he soon despaired the faintest clue to gather.
Then suddenly he whooped with glee: ""Ha! Ha! an inspiration.""
And to and fro along the row he ran with animation.
To Peter, bold he cried: ""Behold, all told there are eleven.
Suppose I fix on Number Six; say Boy! How's that for Heaven?""
""By gosh! you win,"" said Pete. ""Step in. But tell me how you chose him.
They're like as pins; all might be twins. There's nothing to disclose him.""
The Sourdough said: ""'Twas hard; my head was seething with commotion.
I felt a dunce; then all at once I had a gorgeous notion.
I stooped and peered beneath each beard that drooped like fleece of mutton.
My search was crowned. . . . That bird I found; ain't got no belly button.""",A genooine Sourdough story Ain't no yarn for the,"Historical Context 'A Sourdough Story' was initially published in Service's 1940 volume, Bar-Room Ballads, which was published after Service moved from country to country in Europe before finally arriving in California, in the United States, to settle for the remainder of World War Two. Although 'A Sourdough Story' was published several decades after Service left the Yukon for the final time, there is clear reference to his time there, beginning with the title of the poem. “Sourdough,” a kind of bread, was a term that began to be used to describe Alaskan and Yukon prospectors, the most experienced of whom began to carry bread starters to nourish them during the more difficult or distant areas searched through during the gold rush. So, a “sourdough story” is one told about a Klondike prospector, one of the many people Service would have met and befriended during his time in the Yukon. The biblical references throughout this poem are somewhat more numerous than the sourdough ones, though they are also as easy to follow. Saint Peter appears in this poem; historically, he was one of the twelve disciples of Jesus, and after Jesus' execution, became one of the forefront leaders of Christianity, making himself a significant aspect of the creation of the Christian Church, to a point where he is considered today to be its first Pope. The Christian Bible attributes a number of letters and writings to Peter, though there are many religious scholars who doubt the full extent of his authorship to the New Testament. Another important element of Peter's connection to Christianity is that he is seen as the “gatekeeper” to Heaven; tradition suggests that souls that pass away will be unable to enter Heaven unless Saint Peter allows them entry. This is based on an account of a conversation between Jesus and Peter recorded in the Book of Matthew in the Christian Bible. Peter's role in 'A Sourdough Story' reflects his position as Heaven's gatekeeper."

I'd like to say the kindly things that I so oft have heard,
And feel that I could rouse your soul the way that mine you've stirred.
I'd like to give you back the joy that you have given me,
Yet that were wishing you a need I hope will never be;
I'd like to make you feel as rich as I, who travel on
Undaunted in the darkest hours with you to lean upon.
I'm wishing at this Christmas time that I could but repay
A portion of the gladness that you've strewn along my way;
And could I have one wish this year, this only would it be:
I'd like to be the sort of friend that you have been to me.",I'd like to be the help that you've been always glad to be; I,"'A Friend's Greeting' by Edgar Guest is a heart-to-heart poem about a speaker who expresses his gratitude to a friend who is always there to help him and makes his life joyous. This piece begins with the speaker talking about what is the value of his friend in his life. According to him, he wants to be like his dearest friend who is always glad to help him. The speaker wants to be a meaningful part of his life by doing splendid things for him. All he has is his heart-warming poetic art that can paint his sky blue. When they traveled together, his friend's shoulder gave him comfort after being weary of the journey. That's why, on the eve of Christmas, his only wish is to be like his friend."

Fawkes' reputation has evolved, mostly due to the passage of time and the story's popularization within films like V for Vendetta. He's celebrated as a folk hero, someone willing to stand up against something he didn't believe in and martyred for it. Whether his current reputation is deserved, the day continues to be celebrated every November 5th."
73,73,73,"Ay, tear her tattered ensign down!
Long has it waved on high,
And many an eye has danced to see
That banner in the sky;
Beneath it rung the battle shout,
And burst the cannon’s roar;—
The meteor of the ocean air
Shall sweep the clouds no more!
Her deck, once red with heroes’ blood
Where knelt the vanquished foe,
When winds were hurrying o’er the flood
And waves were white below,
No more shall feel the victor’s tread,
Or know the conquered knee;—
The harpies of the shore shall pluck
The eagle of the sea!
O, better that her shattered hulk
Should sink beneath the wave;
Her thunders shook the mighty deep,
And there should be her grave;
Nail to the mast her holy flag,
Set every thread-bare sail,
And give her to the god of storms,—
The lightning and the gale!","Ay, tear her tattered ensign down! Long has it wave","Old Ironsides' by Oliver Wendell Holmes speaks on the glory of the USS Constitution on the eve of its decommissioning. The poem begins with the speaker agreeing that the ship should be decommissioned. He asks that the “ensign” be torn down and eventually nailed to the mast of the ship. The Constitution has sailed for too long and seen too much. It is time for the battles of the past to be put to rest and for the ship to find a grave on the bottom of the sea. While the speaker's words seem passionate, it is clear the poet has the opposite goal in mind. He is actually, through the honouring of the ship, campaigning for its preservation and continuation in the service. By the end of the piece, a reader should come to the same conclusion; that the ship's history is too important to ignore and that it must be allowed to remain on the sea."
74,74,74,"Swerving east, from rich industrial shadows
And traffic all night north; swerving through fields
Too thin and thistled to be called meadows,
And now and then a harsh—named halt, that shields
Workmen at dawn; swerving to solitude
Of skies and scarecrows, haystacks, hares and pheasants,
And the widening river’s slow presence,
The piled gold clouds, the shining gull—marked mud,
 
Gathers to the surprise of a large town:
Here domes and statues, spires and cranes cluster
Beside grain—scattered streets, barge—crowded water,
And residents from raw estates, brought down
The dead straight miles by stealing flat—faced trolleys,
Push through plate—glass swing doors to their desires —
Cheap suits, red kitchen—ware, sharp shoes, iced lollies,
Electric mixers, toasters, washers, driers—
 
A cut—price crowd, urban yet simple, dwelling
Where only salesmen and relations come
Within a terminate and fishy—smelling
Pastoral of ships up streets, the slave museum,
Tattoo—shops, consulates, grim head—scarfed wives;
And out beyond its mortgaged half—built edges
Fast—shadowed wheat—fields, running high as hedges,
Isolate villages, where removed lives
 
Loneliness clarifies. Here silence stands
Like heat. Here leaves unnoticed thicken,
Hidden weeds flower, neglected waters quicken,
Luminously—peopled air ascends;
And past the poppies bluish neutral distance
Ends the land suddenly beyond a beach
Of shapes and shingle. Here is unfenced existence:
Facing the sun, untalkative, out of reach.","A swerving east, from rich industrial shadows and traffic all night north;","‘Here‘ by Philip Larkin captures the evolving journey of the poet’s emotional connection to his surroundings. Progressing from urban shadows and bustling towns to isolated landscapes, the poem illustrates the poet’s evolving perception of places and belongingness. In the poem ‘Here,’ Philip Larkin, the poet embarks on a very detailed exploration of shifting landscapes and the emotional fervor they evoke. The poem begins amidst the urban hustle and industrial shadows before steering eastward to meager fields and solitary spaces. As dawn breaks, the scene transforms into a quaint town, where domes, statues, and barges intermingle with bustling streets. This town stands as a curious blend of simplicity and urbanity, where residents pursue their desires amidst the hum of commerce. Larkin’s skillful imagery captures the essence of a world in transition, where loneliness finds its voice amidst hidden beauty. As the poem, ‘Here‘ progresses, the urban ambiance gives way to an isolated existence. The verses reflect the tranquility that resides in these quieter surroundings — neglected waters coming to life, the air that was weighed down by so many people lifting up, and distant landscapes yielding to the sun’s embrace. Yet, even in this solitude, a stark sense of hope prevails. The imagery of an unfenced existence facing the unreachable sun encapsulates the unspoken distance between the self and the external world. Through its expertly crafted scenes and lyrical language, ‘Here’ becomes a poignant meditation on the interplay between changing landscapes, inner contemplation, and the perennial quest for connection."

To see the year dying,
When winter winds
Set the yellow wood sighing:
Sighing, O sighing!
When such a time cometh
I do retire
Into an old room
Beside a bright fire:
O, pile a bright fire!
And there I sit
Reading old things,
Of knights and lorn damsels,
While the wind sings—
O, drearily sings!
I never look out
Nor attend to the blast;
For all to be seen
Is the leaves falling fast:
Falling, falling!
But close at the hearth,
Like a cricket, sit I,
Reading of summer
And chivalry—
Gallant chivalry!
Then with an old friend
I talk of our youth—
How 'twas gladsome, but often
Foolish, forsooth:
But gladsome, gladsome!
Or, to get merry,
We sing some old rhyme
That made the wood ring again
In summer time—
Sweet summer time!
Then go we smoking,
Silent and snug:
Naught passes between us,
Save a brown jug—
Sometimes!
And sometimes a tear
Will rise in each eye,
Seeing the two old friends
So merrily—
So merrily!
And ere to bed
Go we, go we,
Down on the ashes
We kneel on the knee,
Praying together!
Thus, then, live I
Till, 'mid all the gloom,
By Heaven! the bold sun
Is with me in the room
Shining, shining!
Then the clouds part,
Swallows soaring between;
The spring is alive,
And the meadows are green!
I jump up like mad,
Break the old pipe in twain,
And away to the meadows,
The meadows again!","I'm a dull sight to see the year dying, when winter winds set the yellow","Old Song' by Edward FitzGerald describes a speaker depression over the long weeks of winter, and eventual joy over the coming spring. The poem begins with the speaker giving a brief description of the world outside his window. It is not something he wants to dwell on and only gives the reader enough detail for them to know it is winter, and the wind is blowing drearily. He decides to retreat to his room, by the fireplace, until the season is over. There is meets with a friend, reminisces on the past, drinks, smokes, and prays until finally summer returns. At the moment warmth enters back into the world the speaker runs like “mad” out into the meadows he has so desperately missed."

While it could simply be about a lover, I argue that the unconscious pull of love 'determined' suggests a motherly bond. The poem begins with 'I love you', and continues by examining why she has this emotion. The first stanza focuses on the 'natural order of things', the seasons and weather all flowing just because they must – a comparison Giovanni draws to her state of love. The second stanza focuses on the habits Giovanni has built throughout her life, with love slipping into her life and staying. The third stanza focuses on how happy Giovanni is to be in love, idolising her child's voice and how their presence makes her feel. The fourth stanza explores the safety a relationship provides, Giovanni enjoying waking up and finding her child there in the morning. The final stanza discusses how they met, with the baby seeing Giovanni and 'decided that I [Giovanni] would love you', relating to the natural order of loving your child, and how Giovanni's whole life has changed because of it."

Since Uncle Arthur fired
a bullet into him,
he hadn't said a word.
He kept his own counsel

his eyes were red glass,

The lamb is a universal symbol of selfless innocence, Jesus the Lamb is the gentle imagination, the Divine Humanity. The Lamb identifies with Christ to form a Trinity of child, Lamb, and Redeemer. Throughout the two stanzas of this poem, the poet speaks to the lamb, asking it if it knows who was responsible for creating it. He goes into vague detail about Christ, his nature, while using repetition to emphasize these features."

This piece directly begins with the episode where one of the cave dwellers (in Plato's allegory, the philosopher or the greatest individual) attempts to break the shackles of darkness and face the sun or the light of knowledge. The piercing light not only blinds his eyes but also teaches him something greater than he previously believed in. Besides, he learns the ravages of history and where the world is leading. When he tries to communicate the message to other dwellers, they find it quite unbelievable and false. It makes him question even the reality around him."
80,80,80,"And God stepped out on space,
And he looked around and said:
I'm lonely—
I'll make me a world.
And far as the eye of God could see
Darkness covered everything,
Blacker than a hundred midnights
Down in a cypress swamp.
Then God smiled,
And the light broke,
And the darkness rolled up on one side,
And the light stood shining on the other,
And God said: That's good!
Then God reached out and took the light in his hands,
And God rolled the light around in his hands
Until he made the sun;
And he set that sun a-blazing in the heavens.
And the light that was left from making the sun
God gathered it up in a shining ball
And flung it against the darkness,
Spangling the night with the moon and stars.
Then down between
The darkness and the light
He hurled the world;
And God said: That's good!
Then God himself stepped down—
And the sun was on his right hand,
And the moon was on his left;
The stars were clustered about his head,
And the earth was under his feet.
And God walked, and where he trod
His footsteps hollowed the valleys out
And bulged the mountains up.
Then he stopped and looked and saw
That the earth was hot and barren.
So God stepped over to the edge of the world
And he spat out the seven seas—
He batted his eyes, and the lightnings flashed—
He clapped his hands, and the thunders rolled—
And the waters above the earth came down,
The cooling waters came down.
Then the green grass sprouted,
And the little red flowers blossomed,
The pine tree pointed his finger to the sky,
And the oak spread out his arms,
The lakes cuddled down in the hollows of the ground,
And the rivers ran down to the sea;
And God smiled again,
And the rainbow appeared,
And curled itself around his shoulder.
Then God raised his arm and he waved his hand
Over the sea and over the land,
And he said: Bring forth! Bring forth!
And quicker than God could drop his hand,
Fishes and fowls
And beasts and birds
Swam the rivers and the seas,
Roamed the forests and the woods,
And split the air with their wings.
And God said: That's good!
Then God walked around,
And God looked around
On all that he had made.
He looked at his sun,
And he looked at his moon,
And he looked at his little stars;
He looked on his world
With all its living things,
And God said: I'm lonely still.
Then God sat down—
On the side of a hill where he could think;
By a deep, wide river he sat down;
With his head in his hands,
God thought and thought,
Till he thought: I'll make me a man!
Up from the bed of the river
God scooped the clay;
And by the bank of the river
He kneeled him down;
And there the great God Almighty
Who lit the sun and fixed it in the sky,
Who flung the stars to the most far corner of the night,
Who rounded the earth in the middle of his hand;
This great God,
Like a mammy bending over her baby,
Kneeled down in the dust
Toiling over a lump of clay
Till he shaped it in is his own image;
Then into it he blew the breath of life,
And man became a living soul.

This poem depicts a human-like image of God, the man behind the creation. This poem starts with a sense of continuity. According to the poet, God might have felt lonely. For this reason, he created the earth. But, he was not satisfied until he made humans. In the body of the poem, readers can find how God made this creation bit by bit. Firstly, he brought light into the world by creating, sun, moon, and stars. Thereafter he cooled the temperature of the earth by creating rain and made several creatures fill the space with the spontaneity of life. After this long process, he thought he would be happy. But, he was not. Hence, he created humans from the “lump of clay.”"

And bustle and sluggishness, pleasure and gloom.

There's weakness, and strength both redundant and vain;
Such strength as, if ever affliction and pain
Could pierce through a temper that's soft to disease,
Would be rational peace--a philosopher's ease.

And attention full ten times as much as there needs;
Pride where there's no envy, there's so much of joy;
And mildness, and spirit both forward and coy.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that “Nature” has found a way to imbue the face of “man” with an endless array of emotions. He is able to read these emotions and sees them as being both contrasting and complementary. The speaker points out “thought and no thought” as well as “pleasure and gloom.” In the following lines, the speaker moves from describing all of humanity to a small portion he calls “man.” This word ends up standing in for a particular type of man he fears will run away with his listener's heart. It is his goal with this piece to expose the flaws in their moral character and steer her away from them and towards him."

84,84,84,"Swiftly walk o'er the western wave,
Spirit of Night!
Out of the misty eastern cave,
Where, all the long and lone daylight,
Thou wovest dreams of joy and fear,
Which make thee terrible and dear,—
Swift be thy flight!
Wrap thy form in a mantle gray,
Star-inwrought!
Blind with thine hair the eyes of Day;
Kiss her until she be wearied out,
Then wander o'er city, and sea, and land,
Touching all with thine opiate wand—
Come, long-sought!

I sighed for thee;
When light rode high, and the dew was gone,
And noon lay heavy on flower and tree,
And the weary Day turned to his rest,
Lingering like an unloved guest.

Soon, too soon—

Out of the misty eastern cave, Where, all the long and lone daylight, Thou wovest dreams of joy and fear, Which make thee terrible and dear,— Swift be thy flight! The poet here makes an appeal to Night which has been personified. Night seems to the poet to be a living being, capable of acting in accordance with its own will and capable of listening to the poet. Shelly has, therefore, created a myth here. He appeals to Night to spread itself over the western sky where the sun sets. He imagines that Night spends the hours of daylight in some misty eastern cave, all alone, and that it keeps busy during that time, manufacturing or weaving dreams of joy and fear for human beings. These dreams are seen by human beings during their sleep. Sweet dreams, which human beings see, make Night dear to them; but the frightening dreams, which they see, make Night terrible to them. Thus, human beings are in love with Night and yet, at the same time, they are afraid of Night. The poet is in love with Night without being afraid of it. He wants Night to come swiftly and without delay. Wrap thy form in a mantle gray, Star-inwrought! The poet calls upon Night to wrap itself in a gray-colored cloak which has stars woven in its texture. The dark sky is regarded here as the mantle of Night and the stars that shine in the sky are supposed to be woven in the texture of that mantle. Blind with thine hair the eyes of Day; Kiss her until she be wearied out, Here Day is also personified. The poet asks Night to come and spread its black hair over the eyes of Day, so that Day may no longer be able to see. Then the poet asks Night to overwhelm Day with kisses. Let Day be kissed so vehemently and repeatedly that Day feels tired of these kisses and flees from the world. This is a poetic fancy. What the poet means is that, with the coming of Night, Day withdraws from this world. Then wander o'er city, and sea, and land, Touching all with thine opiate wand— Come, long-sought! We are to imagine that Night carries in its hand magic staffs, which has the power of sending everyone, who is touched with it, to sleep. When Night comes, all creatures fall asleep. When I arose and saw the dawn, I sighed for thee; When light rode high, and the dew was gone, And noon lay heavy on flower and tree, And the weary Day turned to his rest, Lingering like an unloved guest. I sighed for thee. When Day was tired of its stay on the earth, it felt like resting. And yet Day stayed on for some time more, just as a guest might prolong his stay in a house where he is no longer welcome. Here is the use of simile (Lingering like an unloved guest) is made very appropriately. Thy brother Death came, and cried, Wouldst thou me? Thy sweet child Sleep, the filmy-eyed, Murmured like a noontide bee, Shall I nestle near thy side? Wouldst thou me?—And I replied, No, not thee! The poet is interested neither in Death nor in Sleep. He looks upon Death as the brother of Night, and he calls Sleep a child of Night. Death is also the brother of Night because Night stands for darkness, and Death takes human beings into the unknown dark region. Sleep is the child of Night because it is during night that human beings are overcome by Sleep. Both Death and Sleep offer to come to him. Death is prepared to take him away from this world in case he is sick of life. Sleep, which makes the eyelids close, speaks to the poet every sweetly and softly like the murmuring of a bee at noon-time. Sleep offers to creep close to the poet and to send him into a state of temporary forgetfulness. But the poet rejects both these offers, because he is attracted only by Night. Death will come when thou art dead, Soon, too soon— Sleep will come when thou art fled; Of neither would I ask the boon I ask of thee, belovèd Night— Swift be thine approaching flight, Come soon, soon! Death would come to the poet in its own time. It would not take long in coming to the poet. (Here is an unconscious prophecy of Shelley's premature death. It was at the age of 29 that he was drowned in the sea). The poet does not accept the offer of Sleep, because Sleep can come to him when Night is gone. He would not like to waste his time in sleeping. He can sleep permanently after death."

Weak wretched sinner though I be,

And make me to Thy glory live!",My God! O let me call Thee mine! Weak wretched sinner,"'My God! O Let Me Call Thee Mine!' by Anne Brontë is a spiritual poem portraying a person's ultimate desire to please God, despite their little faith and great fears. 'My God! O Let Me Call Thee Mine!' kicks off with the persona's passionate cry to God. The poet persona asks that they and God belong to each other as lovers do. The speaker goes on to outline reasons they are undeserving of God—those reasons being their weak faith, dark pasts, sinful nature, and anxiety about the future. Nonetheless, their request remains because they believe God's presence in their life can fix those issues. As the poem progresses, the speaker alternates these two “prayer points”: reverencing God than asking He relieves them of their worries. The persona concludes with a final request that God makes them live in a way that pleases Him, not themselves. Although the speaker says their faith is weak, they, no doubt, believe firmly in God. Their anxiety about the future and grief from the past challenge their faith throughout the poem. However, that faith persists, as seen in the speaker's tone and mood at the poem's conclusion."

The trouble,"'The Trouble With Geraniums' by Mervyn Peake is a humorous poem with a poignant message about self-perception. The poem takes the reader through several amusing statements about the nature of very basic things. These include flowers, bread, and stars. He asserts that he is troubled by their nature. They are too red, too full of bread, and too bright. The obvious humour in these lines is made meaningful in the last stanza when he describes the trouble he has with himself. This is where the reader comes to understand the main themes of this piece and their commentary on one's opinion of one's self."

Blinded by war, and left. And past the fence

Asking advice of his experience.

And all the nightmares of each empty head
Blew into air; then, hearing us beside,
""Poor chaps, how'd they know what it's like?"" he said.
And we stood there, and watched him as he sat,
Turning his sockets where they went away,

There are no details about who he was, where he fought, or what happened that made him lose his eyes. A few young soldiers came up to him and asked for his advice. He gave it, sharing something of the horrors he encountered. 

At the end of ‘The Veteran’ Cole surprises the reader by revealing, through the veteran’s words, that he is only eighteen. It’s only after concluding the poem that a reader can assess the themes. They include age, experience, and of course, war."

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker asks several rhetorical questions in regard to how much more there is for him to write about his love. He's written so much and knows that he's touched on every possible subject. Despite this, he isn't bored. He continues to write, taking just as much pleasure from the process as ever. He and his lover, the Fair Youth, belong to one another in the same way they did when their love was young. He intends for that to remain the same as they both age, and outward appearances suggest that their love should be “dead.”"

There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.

All the animals that had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.

They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster. You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.

Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together…","The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special","The Rainbow Bridge' is a beautiful, uplifting poem that is dedicated to those who have lost their pets and are looking for solace. Throughout this poem, the poet, whoever they may be, lays out the joyous afterlife that a pet has in store. They are going to leave the world of the living and go to reside in a warm, fertile field where they'll wait for their owners to arrive. After, they will cross over the metaphorical rainbow bridge into heaven together."
90,90,90,"Like a sculptor chipping away at bits of wood,
Time chisels away bits of their memory
It strips away lyrics of the women of my Land
Leaving only a fading tune echoing the song,
they sang in the forlorn fields
about their lives; songs
of how they ploughed the terrain of their landscape
for memories of lyrics lost in the vast void of time,
in those days when a song beheld their lives;
when servitude cuffed the ankles of their soul,
and dereliction decapitated the epic of their lives.
With a song, they sponged off their anguish,
to behold their collective pain,
to celebrate their gains,
give lyrics to the tune of their lives,
cheat the tyranny of tit
and commune with the yet unborn
to give meaning to an epoch lost in antiquity,
Yet time strips the lyrics and scars the tune,
leaving a dying song.

left in the memory of my mind.
Now feeding the verses of poets, it echoes in
Wriggling in the rhythms and melodies,
Hollering in distant tunes

where the song of their lives died.

And the screeching voice of my rib
try to sing the song of the women of my Land
In verses far from the theatre of toil
where they left a song that now roams the land
stripped of lyrics like a scorned ghost.

Who laboured and died leaving a dying song.

The poem begins with the poet utilizing similes and metaphors to speak on the way that time is able to chip away at memory and experiences. It has done its job on the “memory” of the women of his land, Sierra Leone, and now it is stripping away the “lyrics of the song” they used to sing. In the past, their individual experiences came together to form a unifying, uplifting tune that helped them fight back emotionally and mentally against the oppression and slavery they were enduring. Time has taken its toll though, and the song is slowly being lost to the ages, just as these women were. Now, all that's left is a tune that, through personification, is able to wander the “forlorn fields”. It searches out someone who might hear and appreciate it. Luckily, it appears that some do. It is there as inspiration for poets to write new songs based around its sound, just as Farouk wrote this one."

Myself, John Peters and David Kidd.

The lucky and wealthy had their homes
with garages, gardens and apples to spare
Clustered in the trees' green domes
We chose the place we meant to plunder
And climbed the wall and tip-toed through
The secret dark. Apples crunched under Our feet as we moved through the grass and dew.
We found the lower boughs of a tree
That were easy to reach. We stored the fruit
in pockets and jerseys until all three

This piece begins with a reference to the external ambiance. It was the season of autumn. The speaker of this poem recalls how the breeze spiced with garden fires, the smell of burnt leaves, and the early dark excited him when he was a child. Then he gathered in the park with his friends John and David. The kids went out of town to the district where wealthy families lived. They went there to collect apples in the secret dark. After gathering apples, they stepped outside silently as they entered and moved out of town munching their raided items. Now David is fifty and his childish spirit has dimmed. In the case of John, he is no more. Ironically, his grave can be found in a French orchard beneath apple boughs."

This poem begins with a reference to a rainbow. Whenever Wordsworth beholds it, his heart gets filled with enthusiasm and energy. It is not that the sensation of joy existed in his heart when he was a child. As an adult, he still enjoys the beauty of a rainbow. He wishes to retain this childish self even if he matures and grows old. If it does not happen, he will embrace death unquestionably. According to him, nature, symbolized by the rainbow, will always be divine, and he thinks it should be for everyone."

The poem begins with the speaker describing how she got into a car accident. She feared that her partner would be furious with her for what happened, but that was not the case. He surprised her with his kind reaction. The same formula plays out over the following stanzas as the speaker presents a memory of a mistake she made and the pleasantly measured reaction she got from her husband. It is in the fourth stanza that the true nature of the poem is revealed. She is not bringing these memories back to the forefront for sentimental reasons or to make some grand gesture, but as a kind of catharsis. Glass informs the reader that her husband died, having not returned from Vietnam. This means she was never able to acknowledge all that he did for her."

Williams is fascinated by this process, drawing similarities with the human practice of putting on and taking off clothes. The use of personification throughout the poem gives Winter Trees a friendly and comforting sense. The excitement present in Williams' writing makes it appear as if he is friends with the trees, happy to watch them grow and change. The poem ends with the trees going to sleep, ready to pass through the winter. "

He feels disdain towards those who have no regard for the past and don't remember what was lost. Yeats thinks that all the strength of his country has been zapped and all its people have turned inward.

Even the wind mocks him when he runs to catch a bus. He usually counts the stars at night, and the gross total interestingly remains the same each day.

These are important features of human existence that flowed easily from God to humankind. There is one blessing that God did not let out of his cup, rest. He chose to withhold an innate ability to rest from humankind in order to keep his creation close to him. When one gets weary, they turn to God. Or that is his reasoning. Herbert's speaker states that God did not want humanity to love Nature more than they love “the God of Nature.”"

So haggard and so woe-begone?
The squirrel's granary is full,
And the harvest's done.

I see a lilly on thy brow,
With anguish moist and fever dew;
And on thy cheek a fading rose
Fast withereth too.

I met a lady in the meads
Full beautiful, a faery's child;
Her hair was long, her foot was light,
And her eyes were wild.

I set her on my pacing steed,
And nothing else saw all day long;
For sideways would she lean, and sing
A faery's song.

I made a garland for her head,
And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;
She looked at me as she did love,
And made sweet moan.

She found me roots of relish sweet,
And honey wild, and manna dew;
And sure in language strange she said,
I love thee true.

She took me to her elfin grot,
And there she gazed and sighed deep,
And there I shut her wild sad eyes—
So kissed to sleep.

And there we slumbered on the moss,
And there I dreamed, ah woe betide,
The latest dream I ever dreamed
On the cold hill side.

I saw pale kings, and princes too,
Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;
Who cried—""La belle Dame sans merci
Hath thee in thrall!""

With horrid warning gaped wide,
And I awoke, and found me here
On the cold hill side.

The first three stanzas introduce the unidentified speaker and the knight. The speaker comes across the knight wandering around in the dead of winter when “the sedge has withered from the lake/ And no birds sing.” In this way, Keats depicts a barren and bleak landscape. The knight responds to the speaker, telling him how he met a lady in the meadows who was “full beautiful, a faery’s child”. Here, Keats’ language sweetens. The first three stanzas were bitter and devoid of emotion, but the introduction of the “lady in the meads” produces softness in the language of the knight. He reminisces on the lady’s beauty and her apparent innocence – her long hair, light feet, and wild eyes – and on her otherworldliness, as well. Moreover, he describes his sweet memories of the Lady: feeding each other, giving her presents, traveling with her, and being together."

I remember the neckcurls, limp and damp as tendrils;
And her quick look, a sidelong pickerel smile;
And how, once started into talk, the light syllables leaped for her.
And she balanced in the delight of her thought,
A wren, happy, tail into the wind,
Her song trembling the twigs and small branches.
The shade sang with her;
The leaves, their whispers turned to kissing,
And the mould sang in the bleached valleys under the rose.

Oh, when she was sad, she cast herself down into such a pure depth,
Even a father could not find her:
Scraping her cheek against straw,
Stirring the clearest water.
My sparrow, you are not here,
Waiting like a fern, making a spiney shadow.
The sides of wet stones cannot console me,
Nor the moss, wound with the last light.

If only I could nudge you from this sleep,
My maimed darling, my skittery pigeon.
Over this damp grave I speak the words of my love:
I, with no rights in this matter,
Neither father nor lover.","I remember the neckcurls, limp and damp as tendrils; And her quick","'Elegy for Jane' by Theodore Roethke uses intense natural images to depict a deceased young woman and the love the speaker has for her. Throughout this poem, Roethke's speaker uses interesting and memorable images of nature to describe the life of one of his students, Jane. She died after being thrown from her horse and her loss has impacted him deeply. He did not love her as a father or as a lover but he feels in her death the loss of something integral. Since her bird-like presence has left the earth, he has found himself unable to take pleasure in the natural world. The poem ends without a resolution, he is still mourning her and has come to no conclusion about what his next steps should be."

The overview of life includes good things and bad things, proving that life is filled with varying elements that exist in both positive and negative states of being. At some points, in fact, it is hard to discern what the good and bad are within the poem’s situations, which helps to solidify this contrasting method of expressing differentiation. To Levertov, it seems, life is neither primarily filled with good or bad, but its “depths” are still worth “tast[ing].” This thought is the theme of the poem."

It describes the actions of a couple of human-like animals. The narrator describes going to an animal fair and seeing two animals there. These are only two among the many birds and beasts on display. There is a monkey in most versions; sometimes, a skunk or raccoon replaces it. He gets drunk, sits on the elephant's trunk, and then is blown off when the latter sneezes. There are few details about this poem, but alternative versions do provide more child-friendly lines, removing the word “drunk” and its implications."

In this poem, the poet alludes to several biblical passages. The speaker depicts Christ as a savior who will bring peace again in this world. She can see him appearing in his glorious outlook to redeem mankind as he did before. But, this time he won't be too kind to those who previously wiped humanity from the face of the earth. According to the speaker, he is a warrior now, beaming with heroism and vibrant with vengeful energy. However, the portrayal of Christ as a hero and as a warrior hints at something else. Here, the poet tries to infuse the audience with the heroic energy of Christ. In this way, they can get justice for themselves. Jesus Christ is just a metaphor in their proclamation of resistance."
108,108,108,"A man came slowly from the setting sun,
To Forgail's daughter, Emer, in her dun,
And found her dyeing cloth with subtle care,
And said, casting aside his draggled hair:
"" I am Aleel, the swineherd, whom you bid
Go dwell upon the sea cliffs, vapour hid;
But now my years of watching are no more.""

Then Emer cast her web upon the floor,
And stretching her arms, red with the dye,
Parted her lips with a loud sudden cry.

Looking on her, Aleel, the swineherd, said:
"" Not any god alive, nor mortal dead,
Has slain so mighty armies, so great kings,
Nor won the gold that now Cuchulain brings.""

"" Why do you tremble thus from feet to crown?""

Aleel, the swineherd, wept and cast him down
Upon the web-heaped floor, and thus his word:
"" With him is one sweet-throated like a bird.""

"" Who bade you tell these things?"" and then she cried
To those about, "" Beat him with thongs of hide
And drive him from the door.""
And thus it was:
And where her son, Finmole, on the smooth grass
Was driving cattle, came she with swift feet,
And called out to him, "" Son, it is not meet
That you stay idling here with flocks and herds.""
"" I long have waited, mother, for those words:
But wherefore now?""
"" There is a man to die;
You have the heaviest arm under the sky.""

"" My father dwells among the sea-worn bands
And breaks the ridge of battle with his hands.""

"" Nay, you are taller than Cuchulain, son.""

"" He is the mightiest man in ship or dun.""

"" Nay, he is old and sad with many wars,
And weary of the crash of battle cars.""

"" I only ask what way my journey lies,
For God, who made you bitter, made you wise.""

"" The Red Branch kings a tireless banquet keep,
Where the sun falls into the Western deep.
Go there, and dwell on the green forest rim;
But tell alone your name and house to him
Whose blade compels, and bid them send you one
Who has a like vow from their triple dun.""

Between the lavish shelter of a wood
And the gray tide, the Red Branch multitude
Feasted, and with them old Cuchulain dwelt,
And his young dear one close beside him knelt,
And gazed upon the wisdom of his eyes,
More mournful than the depth of starry skies,
And pondered on the wonder of his days;
And all around the harp-string told his praise,
And Concobar, the Red Branch king of kings,
With his own fingers touched the brazen strings.
At last Cuchulain spake: "" A young man strays
Driving the deer along the woody ways.
I often hear him singing to and fro,
I often hear the sweet sound of his bow.
Seek out what man he is.""
One went and came.
"" He bade me let all know he gives his name
At the sword point, and bade me bring him one
Who had a like vow from our triple dun.""

"" I only of the Red Branch hosted now,""
Cuchulain cried, "" have made and keep that vow.""
After short fighting in the leafy shade,
He spake to the young man, "" Is there no maid
Who loves you, no white arms to wrap you round,
Or do you long for the dim sleepy ground,
That you come here to meet this ancient sword?""

"" The dooms of men are in God's hidden hoard.""

"" Your head a while seemed like a woman's head
That I loved once.""
Again the fighting sped,
But now the war rage in Cuchulain woke,
And through the other's shield his long blade broke,
And pierced him.
"" Speak before your breath is done.""

"" I am Finmole, mighty Cuchulain's son.""

"" I put you from your pain. I can no more.""

While day its burden on to evening bore,
With head bowed on his knees Cuchulain stayed;
Then Concobar sent that sweet-throated maid,
And she, to win him, his gray hair caressed;
In vain her arms, in vain her soft white breast.
Then Concobar, the subtlest of all men,
Ranking his Druids round him ten by ten,
Spake thus: "" Cuchulain will dwell there and brood,
For three days more in dreadful quietude,
And then arise, and raving slay us all.
Go, cast on him delusions magical,
That he may fight the waves of the loud sea.""
And ten by ten under a quicken tree,
The Druids chaunted, swaying in their hands
Tall wands of alder, and white quicken wands.

Emer sends her son to fight her husband after getting the news that “With him is one sweet-throated like a bird”. There is another woman in his life, someone who is only described as “young” and “sweet”. Finmole goes to fight his father, does not reveal his identity, and is killed. Cuchulain mourns his death for three days. While in the forest, the king tells his druids to cast a spell on the old hero and send him to his death in the waves. They do so and Cuchulain fights with the sea for four more days before succumbing."

The poem is addressed to the Fair Youth, who is throughout the text complimented on his beauty. He seems not to have aged the whole time the speaker has known him. Over the last three years, he has remained just as fresh and green as when they first met. But, the speaker acknowledges towards the end, he knows this can't be the case. All people age and time moves so slowly that he just can't see it. The final two lines are addressed to future generations. He tells them that when they are alive, the most beautiful person to have ever lived will have already died."

It sets the scene of a domestic environment, where perhaps the narrator is on her deathbed. Then a foreign figure enters who 'leaned above' the narrator. What follows is a progression of mourning in which the male figure expresses sympathy, 'poor child', then cries. The speaker expresses discontent in how this figure did not touch her or do other comforting acts to ease her state. 'After Death' ends with a selfless statement; where the narrator says that despite the male's lack of love, she is still glad that he lives. This poem acknowledges the continuation of ordinary life after a person's death, and it distances itself from the religious connotations associated with the 'afterlife'."

'The Coronet' by Andrew Marvell presents the poet's attempt to honor Christ with his poetic “coronet”. To weave these garlands of honor, the poet would even remove the flowers which his beloved women have been wearing in their tall head-dresses. What the poet means is that he would collect the best available words and phrases to write a suitable poem in praise of Christ. However, the poet is now overcome by doubt. He finds the old serpent lurking amongst the flowers of the garlands which he has woven. In other words, he finds that the poem that is trying to write has been prompted by a desire to seek fame and in the hope of worldly advancement. Fame and self-interest are the temptations offered to him by Satan. The poet now scolds himself for allowing selfish motives to mar his tribute to Christ. Finally, he appeals to Christ directly to trample upon both the serpent and the garlands which the poet has so skillfully woven. His garlands could not crown Christ's head; but, when Christ tramples upon them, they will crown his feet. "

The refrain for this In Real Time ghazal poem is the phrase “In real time,” and it is repeated at the end of its every couplet. Ali takes that structure and applies it to a poem that reveals, through short eleven-syllable lines, the hellish nature of life in India, Ali’s home country. Pain, suffering, and injustice have all been intertwined very skillfully and carefully to create powerful meaning within the complex structure of a ghazal, which relates directly to the complicated social structure that is central to the underlying meaning of the poem. First developed in the 6th century in pre-Islamic-Arabic verse, this style of poetry has very personal ties with Ali as it pays homage to his Hindu and Muslim heritage. Concurrently many of his themes that Ali uses correlate with that heritage, as well. “Exile, nostalgia for lost or ruined landscapes, and political conflict” inform Ali’s all poetic works and expose his heritage. In this ghazal poem, all of these themes are evident."

While Movement poetry was a closed system, a down-to-earth, humanistic approach to poetry, Hughes wrote with mystical language and the idea of something more. As Hughes himself said, “One of the things those poets had in common I think was the post-war mood of having ha enough … enough rhetoric, enough overweening push of any kind, enough of the dark gods, enough of the id, enough of the Angelic powers and the heroic efforts to make new worlds. They'd seen it all turn into death-camps and atomic bombs. All they wanted was to get back in civvies and get home to the wife and kids and for the rest of their lives, not a thing was going to interfere with a nice cigarette and a nice view of the park …. Now I came a bit later. I hadn't had enough. I was all for opening negotiations with whatever happened to be out there.” 'The Thought-Fox', which you can read in full here, takes this approach to poetry. It is a poem about the writing of a poem, utilizing the symbol of the fox to stand for the idea of the muse: fleeting and quick, it haunts the poet-writer, disturbing his quiet night."

In the first part of this poem, the speaker begins by describing the long journey that his town has been on. Their long history of tradition was interrupted by British colonialism. The speaker represents this through the image of the motor car, bicycle, and boss. The city was “brought into the village,” and people began looking to the future and to other places. The speaker bounces between feelings of acceptance about the New World in which their living and feelings of regret regarding what's been lost in the past. They do not ignore the benefits that have come to their village but are well aware of the dark hand of the past, reminding everyone of what's been lost."

The artist didn't give me a chance to
Pose properly, and as you can see,
Poor chap, he had this obsession with
Triangles, so he left off two of my
Feet. I didn't comment at the time
(What, after all, are two feet
To a monster?) but afterwards
I was sorry for the bad publicity.
Why, I said to myself, should my conqueror
Be so ostentatiously beardless, and ride
A horse with a deformed neck and square hoofs?
Why should my victim be so
Unattractive as to be inedible,
And why should she have me literally
On a string? I don't mind dying
Ritually, since I always rise again,
But I should have liked a little more blood
To show they were taking me seriously.

It's hard for a girl to be sure if
She wants to be rescued. I mean, I quite
Took to the dragon. It's nice to be
Liked, if you know what I mean. He was
So nicely physical, with his claws
And lovely green skin, and that sexy tail,
And the way he looked at me,
He made me feel he was all ready to
Eat me. And any girl enjoys that.
So when this boy turned up, wearing machinery,
On a really dangerous horse, to be honest
I didn't much fancy him. I mean,
What was he like underneath the hardware?
He might have acne, blackheads or even
Bad breath for all I could tell, but the dragon--
Well, you could see all his equipment
At a glance. Still, what could I do?
The dragon got himself beaten by the boy,
And a girl's got to think of her future.


I have diplomas in Dragon
Management and Virgin Reclamation.
My horse is the latest model, with
Automatic transmission and built-in
Obsolescence. My spear is custom-built,
And my prototype armour
Still on the secret list. You can't
Do better than me at the moment.
I'm qualified and equipped to the
Eyebrow. So why be difficult?
Don't you want to be killed and/or rescued
In the most contemporary way? Don't
You want to carry out the roles
That sociology and myth have designed for you?
Don't you realize that, by being choosy,
You are endangering job prospects
In the spear- and horse-building industries?
What, in any case, does it matter what
You want? You're in my way.","I'm afraid I'm not my best side, I'm afraid. The artist","Not my Best Side' U. A. Fanthorpe is a humorous transformation of the dynamic between the characters in Paolo Uccello's Saint George and the Dragon. The poem starts from the perspective of the dragon. He knows he has to be slain, as that's in the story, but he expresses his disappointment that this particular knight, with his strange horse, is going to be the one to do it. He's also annoyed that he wasn't painted better or more bloodied, as if dying dramatically. He goes on to speak ill of the woman he's supposedly wanting to eat, calling her too ugly to be edible. Next, the poet moves on to give the reader the woman's perspective. Rather than feeling fear, she too is disappointed by the knight who's come to save her. She's actually enjoyed spending time with the dragon. She sexualizes him, speaking kindly and lustfully about his colorful scales. Finally, the readers get to hear from the knight. Again, the poet puts forward a perceptive that is different than what is expected. Rather than valiant and brave, the knight comes across as self-absorbed and whiny. He becomes easily frustrated with the dragon's lack of cooperation."

Bringing the cheque and the postal order,

Pulling up Beattock, a steady climb:
The gradient's against her, but she's on time.

Past cotton-grass and moorland boulder
Shovelling white steam over her shoulder,

Snorting noisily as she passes
Silent miles of wind-bent grasses.

Birds turn their heads as she approaches,
Stare from bushes at her blank-faced coaches.

Sheep-dogs cannot turn her course;
They slumber on with paws across.

In the farm she passes no one wakes,
But a jug in a bedroom gently shakes.


Dawn freshens, Her climb is done.
Down towards Glasgow she descends,
Towards the steam tugs yelping down a glade of cranes
Towards the fields of apparatus, the furnaces
Set on the dark plain like gigantic chessmen.

In dark glens, beside pale-green lochs
Men long for news.

Dreaming of terrifying monsters

Asleep in granite Aberdeen,

The poem conforms to a consistent rhyme scheme and metrical pattern that follows the path of a train. It carries letters from every part of the world on every topic up a hill and through the grasses. The smoke flies over the train and into the distance as it powers forward towards the city. Once there, in amongst all the sleeping people, it delivers the much longed-for notes from friends, associates, business partners, and family members. Each recipient is gladdened by the feeling of remembrance, of not being forgotten. "

In our dry cellar

Paralysed force, gesture without motion;

Form prayers to broken stone.

The poem begins with the speaker, who is really a group, describing how their lives as “The Hollow Men.” They are, or they are like a group of scarecrows. The men are exiting somewhere between life and death, in a world, they have no agency in. It becomes clear as the poem progresses that they are unable to enter into true death. There is no money for them to cross the river. Instead, they have to wait for something to change. At the end of the poem, the men are described as dancing around a cactus and singing. Even in this context, they are unable to finish the song or their prayers to God. The poem ends with the speaker stating that the world is going to end anticlimactically.

The poem starts with the speaker describing being served a specific dish. As the lines progress, it becomes clear that he cares deeply for his Nani, as she does for him. But, there is some barrier to their ability to communicate clearly with one another. The speaker is often lost for words, and she's using those that he no longer understands. He spends the second stanza describing his Nani and the life she led. There is evidence of it in all of her wrinkles. They tell stories about her connections to other people and other family members. The poem concludes with her serving the speaker more food before he can find the words to tell her whether he wants more or not."

In the first stanza, the speaker notes that he's been in love for three days. This is something he's not shy about. Nor does he seem self-conscious about the fact that people do not fall in love in such a short period of time. He addresses it clearly and even notes that he knows it could not last. But, his love is so constant (more so than anyone else in the world) that he thinks it will.

Standing in line at the locksmith's
waiting for a set of your keys to be cut

lights the uncut sets along the wall
like lucky charms along a bracelet.
And I realise that's how I felt when we first met -
an uncut key, a smooth blade, edentate,


waiting for your impression, the milling and grooves
of moments in time, until our keyways would fit,
as they finally did in that chapel, our breaths
rising and falling in unison as we listened to the Messiah,
touching at elbow, shoulder and hip

like a pair of Siamese twins sharing one lung.
From then on I was sure we were keyed alike.
That our combinations matched,
our tumblers aligned precisely to give and roll perfectly
into the other's empty spaces.

And at night, when you slept facing away from me
and I held the bow of your hip,
again it was coming home, my stomach, the small of your back,
my knees in the hollows of yours, a master key fit.
So when did the bolt slip? The blade break in the mouth?

Useless now, I understand, to try and unpick the months
back to that second when, for the first time,
one us made a turn that failed to dock,
went nowhere, stuck half-way, leaving us
waiting the expected click, which never came.

So strange then, that we should do this now,
this cutting of keys, just when we're changing all the locks.","When we first met, we were keyed alike, and we were able to fit","In ‘Keyways’, Sheers portrays himself and his ex-girlfriend after breaking up, waiting for a set of keys to be cut so that he can go and retrieve his belongings from her flat. The poem takes places after the relationship has ended, and has a somber tone throughout. While waiting in line, Sheers thinks back over his relationship, using the extended metaphor of a key being cut to represent the impact of moments of his relationship upon him. The final failure to connect, the key which doesn’t turn in the lock, is a symbol of the relationship breaking down. The poem is typical to Sheers, intertwining themes of relationships, and memory seamlessly."

The poem takes words used by Burial in an interview, then putting them into a longer context. The poem reads like a story, Berry commenting on her own mental state. Berry creates a sense of melancholy, discussing being apart from someone. The physical sensation of missing someone is the key here, Berry exploring loss. The poem then progresses to discussing situations in which she feels unsafe. Following this, images of nature comfort the poet. The final few lines of the poem point towards memory. Being reminded of someone brings them to the forefront of your mind. Yet, Berry suggests that if you try and 'talk about it', they disappear all over again. The interview with Burial can be read here."

The poem begins in a romantic fashion depicting a cherishing seaside landscape with rocks, rippling waves, and sea-larks' sweet twitters. With the unfolding of the primary image, Browning's speaker hints at the simple doctrine of human life, which is to accept everything as they come like the firm rocks by the sea. Then digressing from the central image, the speaker talks about her past love. She is of the view that one should try to make their surroundings better by their pain and longings. The suffering in this world is definitely going to help one to get to heaven."

Likewise, in the first stanza, the poetic persona refers to two different questions, one about the yield and another about the number of poems. Thereafter, the persona sees someone counting a bundle of one-rupee notes in his dream vision. Surprisingly, the cashier eats up the notes. Moreover, in the following stanza, the poet refers to a maxim said by a poet. In the next stanza, the poet asserts his individualism and non-conformist attitude towards society. The fourth stanza is undoubtedly similar to the previous sections. Here, the poet talks about the sound of the gun alongside the scent of flowers.

Throughout The Revenant, and especially after the turn, Collins implies that dogs and other animals have the same spiritual capacity as human beings.

A fragment of the sunset’s mystery—
A fleck of gold.
The crimson haze is on the alder trees
In places lush;
Already sings with sweet and lyric ease
The western thrush.
Lord God, for some of us the days and years
Have bitter been;
For some of us the burden and the tears,
The gnawing sin.
For some of us, O God, the scanty store,
The failing bin;
For some of us the gray wolf at the door,
The red, within!
But to the hungry Thou hast given meat,
Hast clothed the cold;
And Thou hast given courage strong and sweet
To the sad and old.
And so we thank Thee, Thou most tender God,
For the leaf and flower;
For the tempered winds, and quickening, velvet sod,
And the gracious shower.
Yea, generous God, we thank Thee for this land
Where all are fed,
Where at the doors no freezing beggars stand,
Pleading for bread.",The winter has been sweet and brief in this fair land; For us the budded willow,"'A Thank-Offering' by Ella Higginson is a simple poem in which the speaker thanks God for all that he is done. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker uses lyrical language and many examples of imagery to describe their natural world. There are many beautiful sights to behold, all of which day is a tribute to God's creation. They acknowledge that people around them have suffered, but God has always been there to provide the needy with resources. The poem concludes with the speaker thanking God for all he has provided."

He shows no interest in her suffering and goes about his business as calmly as he can. The poem concludes with other women intervening and trying to revive the woman with smelling salts. "

In the first lines of 'Waking in Winter' the sky is portrayed as hard, cold and slick and the trees are relayed to the reader as “stiff” as if “burnt nerves.” With these descriptions, Plath intended to convey a space that is devoid of feeling— it has all been burnt off. The “nerves” which are responsible for feeling within the human body, are destroyed. In the fourth line, she takes the reader into her dreams and speaks about “destruction, annihilations”. It soon becomes clear that the speaker and a companion are taking a car trip to a resort, but the places they pass are dark, poisoned, and speak of death. Eventually, they get to the resort and the speaker describes skull-like people looking at the views, and emotionless nurses tending to those in residence there. The whole poem feels colorless, loveless, and hopeless. Death is the reigning power in the world Plath has created."
139,139,139,"I read of a man who stood to speak
At the funeral of a friend
He referred to the dates on the tombstone
From the beginning...to the end

He noted that first came the date of birth
And spoke the following date with tears,
But he said what mattered most of all
Was the dash between those years

For that dash represents all the time
That they spent alive on earth.
And now only those who loved them
Know what that little line is worth

For it matters not, how much we own,
The cars...the house...the cash.
What matters is how we live and love
And how we spend our dash.

So, think about this long and hard.
Are there things you'd like to change?
For you never know how much time is left
That can still be rearranged.

If we could just slow down enough
To consider what's true and real
And always try to understand
The way other people feel.

And be less quick to anger
And show appreciation more
And love the people in our lives
Like we've never loved before.

If we treat each other with respect
And more often wear a smile,
Remembering this special dash
Might only last a little while

With your life's actions to rehash...
Would you be proud of the things they say
About how you spent YOUR dash?",I read of a man who stood to speak At the funeral of a friend he,"'The Dash' by Linda Ellis is a well-known poem that addresses the brevity of life and the importance of living a good loved-filled one. The poem begins with the speaker describing a speech they heard about. It was given by a man at a funeral who was addressing the life of his deceased friend. He asked everyone there to consider the “dash” in between the friend's birth and death. That, he said, is what really matters. Using this little story as the basis for the poem, the speaker talks to the reader. They ask everyone to consider how they've been living their own dash and if after they've died they would be proud of what they've done."

The speaker spends the lines celebrating the beauty of one woman. He compares her beauty to night rather than day. The latter is suggested to be “gaudy,” and the “lady” certainly isn't. The speaker describes different aspects of the woman, like her hair and skin. She is the image of peaceful beauty. The woman is unaware of the impact that she's had on the speaker, who is also the poet, by the end of 'She Walks in Beauty.' The speaker is interested in the woman's inner beauty as well as her outer beauty or physical beauty."

In this piece the “father” of the boy is getting farther and farther away from him, the child cannot hear or see him. He is without guidance in the dark but after a time of suffering the “vapours” fly away and he is, presumably, able to find his way back.

This short poem creates a grave mood by using symbols and imagery. It consists of a set of images including the “pale closed door,” “white apples,” “taste of stone,” “coat,” and “galoshes”. Each image refers to a particular idea that is integral to the theme. This poem presents a speaker, probably the poet himself, who has lost his father a week ago. One day, he wakes up by hearing the echo of his father's voice. It makes him restless and sad. He looks around him. In each item he stares at contains the hue of death. In the end, he wishes if his father called him again, he would be there at his side."

By the time he has all the “wattles” he needs to construct the house he realizes he doesn't have the straw he needs for the roof. Ysinno travels to the nearby “Walauwa” or manor house and asks the “Menike,” or lady of the house for help. He is told to come back at the end of the next harvest season when he can retrieve the straw he needs. Ysinno is unable to wait that long and tells her so.

In the first two stanzas of the poem, the speaker describes the weaponry which a young man is going to have to take up to fight against his prescribed enemies. The bayonet and bullets are personified. They are described as a longing for flesh and as having sharp teeth that are poised to inflict horror on anyone. The final stanza contrasts the previous in that it talks about the boy's nature. He was not built for this destruction. He's young and happy and there's nothing about him that's monstrous or terrible, unlike war itself."

Fanthorpe is a reflection on the role the poet has been forced to play within society due to her illness. There is a fine line between the life the poet wants and the one she has, and this is explored through the constantly changing narrative directions of the poem. Fanthorpe challenges the reader to reflect on their own life, on the role they play, and how they present themselves to society. Although the tone of the poem is overly sardonic, there are flashes of an innate desire to live and to thrive. Fanthorpe seems to be caught in a purgatory of wanting more and finding out how to live as she is."

A man,"'The Women Gather' is a short free verse poem that speaks on how we judge one another and the essentially good nature of human beings. The poem begins with the speaker describing horrible times of tragedy, such as a death, “women gather” together for moral support. Together they are able to help one another through difficulties. The speaker continues to describe a number off different types of people who, themselves, can cause tragedy. She speaks on the hypocrites who pray the loudest in church, and those who present to be “humane” but never act on it. She is dismayed by diplomats who promote war and the fact that sometimes the old must bury the young. While all of these things are awful, they are abominations. They do not occur so often that the world cannot be changed. She then asks the reader how one is able to judge a man when anyone could have a secret life. She answers the question by stating that “We” must judge by understanding good intentions, even if the result aren't what the person wanted or was hoping for. We must come together and help one another in times of stress and learn to comfort when it is needed. Hope must be passed on. Through these changes we make to ourselves we will be able to find goodness within negative situations. It will exist like an “unburnt” picture pulled from ashes."

Giants, a common symbol and character in Cornish stories, were well worth defeating. The tune, which is chanted by a giant in the story, is incredibly well-known today. It was even referenced by William Shakespeare in King Lear. He wrote these lines, spoken by Edgar: Child Roland to the dark tower came,His word was still “Fie, foh, and fum,I smell the blood of a British man.” The story originally appeared in a chapbook in 1711. The plot was later used in a text published in 1760 by John Cotton and Joshua Eddowes. It's unclear though where exactly this story originated from. Some suggest it could date back as early as the 1100s, in one form or another. There are some similarities between this tale and Norse Mythology, such as the various miniature series within the longer tale of his life. Scholars have also noted the magical objects he acquires as interesting related features. Specifically, scholars have cited a story called “The Herd-boy and the Giant” as a similar tale in addition to “Tom Thumb,” a story from Norse myth."

It is one that speaks of wealth, poverty, and friendship. The speaker in this poem experiences the loss of all that he once had. He loses his wealth, his luxuries, and his friends. Out of all that he lost, he feels the loss of his friends most acutely. The poem reveals the heart of the speaker in that he cares for other human beings more than he cares for money. The reason that he misses his money, is because he could treat his friends and be surrounded by people. His despair in losing his money and his friends can be read as both a warning and a comfort."

I long to see.","A night was near, a day was near; Between a day and night I hear","'A Hope Carol' by Christina Rossetti describes a liminal space in which the speaker is existing and the phenomenological elements of life which inspire her to hope for the future. Each of the poem's eight-line sections begins with describing a liminal, or in-between, space in which the speaker exists. In the first, she is between night and day, the second, between the stars and moon, and finally, in the third, between today and tomorrow. Within each one of these spaces, she is confronted by a sound that reminds her of something she “longs” for. Voices are calling and sound reverberating, falling, and rising around her. These noises remind her of her birds and the sounds of minstrels playing music. 'A Hope Carol' concludes with the speaker's final acceptance of the fact that her future, and all the things she most desires, may come today, or “may be” tomorrow. She knows she can't control the world and is willing to wait to get what she wants the most."

Some of the words within this poem are quite challenging, so I've defined them for you here to allow for better comprehension: munificence: the quality of being munificent, or showing unusual generosity reticule: a small purse or bag, originally of the network but later of silk, rayon, etc. flagrant: blazing, burning, or glowing (this word has multiple definitions. The one that applies to this poem is considered archaic, meaning that while this word was used for this purpose in the past, it isn't used to mean this now) ferocity: a ferocious quality or state; savage fierceness geranium: This is typically used to describe a type of flower, but in this context, it refers to a vivid red color"

The first nine lines of the poem present a number of statements that begin with the word, “Where…” These statements are each positive attributes that Tagore is hoping India will achieve. The poem resolves by finishing all of these sentences, and Tagore makes a plea to his Father, for his country to wake up into “that heaven of freedom.” In this poem, Tagore lays out the tenants of what could be called a utopian society."

Throughout it all, however, he perseveres and is successful in his endeavors. He faces each challenge with courage and is not afraid, and he can surmount any hardship. “In the fell clutch of circumstance” or “Under the bludgeonings of chance,” he has not bowed his head. However, he knows at some point in time; one has to enter the horrid palace of death.

But, it shall find the speaker unafraid. It does not matter to him how narrow the gate to heaven is. Neither the “punishments” inscribed on the “scroll” makes him frightened. It is his self-belief and courage that will sail him through all the difficulties."
159,159,159,"For six months just head without body, six months just body without head, has anyone
seen a land inhabited by these people?
No? I have; it’s not a folktale; I’ve not only seen but have been to that land.
For six months to talk and to eat is their job; like a millstone grinding. The following six
months Bhima gorging and Shakuni suffering; for the headless body only shitting is its
share. The head talks, eats, drinks; just talking, eating, drinking. While the body is
working, laboring, shitting; work, labor, shit. To sweat, to be bone-weary. In the land of
the half- body.
Do women live in that land? What does the species of women look like?
There are women; there are children. The same goes for women too, half-and-half body.
They have long hair like the women of our land. They are big, tall, buxom, broad and
well- proportioned. As for clothes, they hang them below the waist. The law of the land
does not permit a body hidden by clothes. When the body dwells for six months it is
springtime for them. (Since the bodies are headless when the men and the women meet,
they are not fastidious). The head-only gives birth within six months. Besides talking and
eating the mouths of the women also deliver babies. The women have more attributes
than the men do. That is why the women have no teeth. God created them with ingenuity.
When the head walks, its two broad, fanlike ears, spread wide and it flies like a bird,
beating its wings. When they speak, we can comprehend their language; they speak the
language of men. But when the headless body speaks, a voice that no stranger can
recognize emits from an orifice of the body. This voice is also accompanied by an odor.
A land such as this one is in the news; a land much talked about. The moon shines at
night; the sun shines in the afternoon. There is no predicament of poverty; dearth of food
and clothes is unknown. Some men even surpass Kuber. And the earnings of the body’s
sweat of six months, the six month-old head eats up with a vengeance.
There are political rights; a government is set up in the land. Democracy functions with
total success. An election is held every five years. But for the people in this land there
are no names. So for the nameless citizens the nameless representatives govern the land
of the half-humans. Because whether to give human names to the head or to the body —
no one can decide. A land such as this is very much in the news, a land much talked
about.","For six months just head without body, six months just body without head, has anyone seen","'The Land of the Half-Humans' by Thangjam Ibopishak Singh talks about an imaginary land inhabited by humans living six months with heads and the rest with bodies. 'The Land of the Half-Humans' by Thangjam Ibopishak Singh talks about a place similar to any Indian state where humans live with heads for six months and the rest of the year with only their bodies. That's why those peculiar humans go on eating, drinking, and talking for the first six months. In the rest of the year, the “half-body” performs working, laboring, and shitting. The women of this land have well-proportioned bodies and unlike men, they give birth through their mouths. According to the poet, this land inhabited by nameless half-humans is always in the news. The poet isn't sure why the land is so famous as it is just like any other democratic state of India."
160,160,160,"I have been so great a lover: filled my days
So proudly with the splendour of Love's praise,
The pain, the calm, and the astonishment,
Desire illimitable, and still content,
And all dear names men use, to cheat despair,
For the perplexed and viewless streams that bear
Our hearts at random down the dark of life.
Now, ere the unthinking silence on that strife
Steals down, I would cheat drowsy Death so far,
My night shall be remembered for a star
That outshone all the suns of all men's days.
Shall I not crown them with immortal praise
Whom I have loved, who have given me, dared with me
High secrets, and in darkness knelt to see
The inenarrable godhead of delight?
Love is a flame:—we have beaconed the world's night.
A city:—and we have built it, these and I.
An emperor:—we have taught the world to die.
So, for their sakes I loved, ere I go hence,
And the high cause of Love's magnificence,
And to keep loyalties young, I'll write those names
Golden for ever, eagles, crying flames,
And set them as a banner, that men may know,
To dare the generations, burn, and blow
Out on the wind of Time, shining and streaming . . . .
These I have loved:
White plates and cups, clean-gleaming,
Ringed with blue lines; and feathery, faery dust;
Wet roofs, beneath the lamp-light; the strong crust
Of friendly bread; and many-tasting food;
Rainbows; and the blue bitter smoke of wood;
And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers;
And flowers themselves, that sway through sunny hours,
Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon;
Then, the cool kindliness of sheets, that soon
Smooth away trouble; and the rough male kiss
Of blankets; grainy wood; live hair that is
Shining and free; blue-massing clouds; the keen
Unpassioned beauty of a great machine;
The benison of hot water; furs to touch;
The good smell of old clothes; and other such—
The comfortable smell of friendly fingers,
Hair's fragrance, and the musty reek that lingers
About dead leaves and last year's ferns. . . .
Dear names,
And thousand other throng to me! Royal flames;
Sweet water's dimpling laugh from tap or spring;
Holes in the ground; and voices that do sing;
Voices in laughter, too; and body's pain,
Soon turned to peace; and the deep-panting train;
Firm sands; the little dulling edge of foam
That browns and dwindles as the wave goes home;
And washen stones, gay for an hour; the cold
Graveness of iron; moist black earthen mould;
Sleep; and high places; footprints in the dew;
And oaks; and brown horse-chestnuts, glossy-new;
And new-peeled sticks; and shining pools on grass;—
All these have been my loves. And these shall pass,
Whatever passes not, in the great hour,
Nor all my passion, all my prayers, have power
To hold them with me through the gate of Death.
They'll play deserter, turn with the traitor breath,
Break the high bond we made, and sell Love's trust
And sacramented covenant to the dust.
——Oh, never a doubt but, somewhere, I shall wake,
And give what's left of love again, and make
New friends, now strangers. . . . But the best I've known
Stays here, and changes, breaks, grows old, is blown
About the winds of the world, and fades from brains
Of living men, and dies.
Nothing remains.
O dear my loves, O faithless, once again
This one last gift I give: that after men
Shall know, and later lovers, far-removed,
Praise you, 'All these were lovely'; say, 'He loved.'",I have been so great a lover: filled my days So proudly with the splendour,"The Great Lover' by Rupert Brooke contains a speaker's profession of love for his past partners and a wide range of objects and experiences. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he has been a “great…lover.” A reader will soon come to understand that this refers to intimate partners as well as experiences. First, he takes the time to describe how his love is at night brighter than any other star in the sky. Anyone who saw it would remember it and pass on their astonishment at its brilliance. The speaker goes on to state that he has loved many things and wants to write their names on a banner and wave it in the wind. This way they will always be remembered. In the next lines he lists out a great number of objects and experiences he has seen and had in his life. These range from “blue-massing clouds” and “furs to touch” to “footprints in the dew” and pools of water. Although the speaker has spent the first two-thirds of the poem bragging on the variety of things he loves, the mood changes in the last section. Here, he tries to come to terms with the fact that he is going to lose everything in his life when he dies. When he passes into the realm of death all the “loves” of his life will abandon him. They will become “faithless” and remain on earth. He is saddened by this prospect but also somewhat cheered as he knows he'll find new loves wherever he ends up. His parting gift to his past life is that his “loves” will be known by all to be splendid."
161,161,161,"I really thought that drinking here would
Start a new chain, that the soft storms
Would abate, and the horror stories, the
Noises men make to frighten themselves,
rest secure on the lip as a canyon as day
Died away, and they would still be there the next morning.
Nothing is very simple.
You must remember that certain things die out for awhile
So that they can be remembered with affection
Later on and become holy. Look at Art Deco
For instance or the ""tulip mania"" of Holland:
Both things we know about and recall
With a certain finesse as though they were responsible
For part of life. And we congratulate them.
Each day as the sun wends its way
Into your small living room and stays
You remember the accident of night as though it were a friend.
All that is forgotten now. There are no
Hard feelings, and it doesn't matter that it will soon
Come again. You know what I mean. We are wrapped in
What seems like a positive, conscious choice, like a bird
In air. It doesn't matter that the peonies are tipped in soot
Or that a man will come to station himself each night
Outside your house, and leave shortly before dawn,
That nobody answers when you pick up the phone.
You have all lived through lots of these things before
And know that life is like an ocean: somethimes the tide is out
And sometimes it's in, but it's always the same body of water
Even though it looks different, and
It makes the things on the shore look different.
They depend on each other like the snow and the snowplow.
It's only after realizing this for a long time
That you can make a chain of events like days
That more and more rapidly come to punch their own number
Out of the calendar, draining it. By that time
Space will be a jar with no lid, and you can live
Any way you like out on those vague terraces,
Verandas, walkways-- the forms of space combined with itme
We are allowed, and we live them passionately,
Fortunately, though we can never be described
And would make lousy characters in a novel.","I really thought that drinking here would Start a new chain, that the soft storms Woul","'Knocking Around' by John Ashbery is a complex poem about the duality of life, its pros, and cons, as well as the way that “you” live it. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker uses the first-person perspective to suggest that they are seeking a change in their life, looking for a way to abate the “soft storms of life and “rest secure.” As the poem progresses, the speaker describes the ways that human beings look back on the past and reframe it in a new way. They specifically cite the tulip mania in Holland and the Art Deco movement. In the following lines, the speaker continues to discuss the ways that human beings consider the ups and downs of life. Ashbery uses a very interesting simile to compare the positives and negatives of life to the high and low tides in the ocean. Even though the ocean looks different, it is still the same ocean, just as life is the same no matter if it feels positive or negative. These lights and darks, like day and night, depending on one another. The poem concludes with several more image-rich and interesting statements about the nature of life and the way that people choose to live it."

Brown describes the charismatic effect Ma Rainey has on her fans and how everyone can relate to her songs. The first part of the poem describes how folks from miles away come to town just to attend a Ma Rainey show. People from Cape Girardeau to Poplar Bluff travel for miles down to New Orleans in motorcars and mules to listen to her songs. The second part describes the scene before she comes on stage. Folks from all walks of life gather there and sit patiently for her to come before them. Her songs, perhaps her emotions, can travel directly to their hearts as she speaks in their language and sings their unlucky tales. In the final section, the narrator talks about one fellow, who once listened to Ma Rainey singing “Backwater Blues.” He could say nothing much except how she just gets hold of them in some kind of way."

They are rid of all work, jobs, and responsibilities that the real world would demand of them. They also don't have to worry about punishments from those in power or following any set of rules. There is also a repetition of the fact that everyone, no matter their beauty, power, or age will find death."

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins by telling the listener/s that they want their life and death to do as much good for the world as possible. This means that their body should be given away to those who need it, as well as their memory utilized in the best way. The speaker wants the listener to consider the love they shared and rather than mourn it, use it to better the world. The speaker doesn't want anyone to cry for them. Instead, people should cry for and pay attention to those who are still alive and suffering. Turn to them and use whatever energy “you” have to improve their lives. "
165,165,165,"spaceFrom my ancestors the Gauls I have pale blue eyes, a narrow brain, and awkwardness in competition. I think my clothes are as barbaric as theirs. But I don't butter my hair.

The Gauls were the most stupid hide-flayers and hay-burners of their time.

From them, I inherit: idolatry, and love of sacrelige; - oh! all sorts of vice, anger, lechery, - terrific stuff, lechery; - lying, above all, and laziness.

I have a horror of all trades and crafts. Bosses and workers, all of them peasants, and common. The hand that holds the pen is as good as the one that holds the plow. - What a century for hands! - I'll never learn to use my hands. And then, domesticity goes too far. The propriety of beggary shames me. Criminals are as disgusting as men without balls: I'm intact, and I don't care.

But! who has made my tongue so treacherous, that until now it has counseled and kept me in idleness? I have not used even my body to get along. Out-idling the sleepy toad, I have lived everywhere. There's not one family in Europe that I don't know. - Families, I mean, like mine, who owe their existence to the Declaration of the Rights of Man. - I have known each family's eldest son!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

If only I had a link to some point in the history of France!

But instead, nothing.

I am well aware that I have always been of an inferior race. I cannot understand revolt. My race has never risen, except to plunder: to devour like wolves a beast they did not kill.

I remember the history of France, the Eldest Daughter of the Church. I would have gone, a village serf, crusading to the Holy Land; my head is full of roads in the Swabian plains, of the sight of Byzantium, of the ramparts of Jerusalem; the cult of Mary, the pitiful thought of Christ crucified, turns in my head with a thousand profane enchantments. - I sit like a leper among broken pots and nettles, at the foot of a wall eaten away by the sun. - And later, a wandering mercenary, I would have bivouacked under German nighttimes.

Ah! one thing more: I dance the Sabbath in a scarlet clearing, with old women and children.

I don't remember much beyond this land, and Christianity. I will see myself forever in its past. But always alone; without a family; what language, in fact, did I used to speak? I never see myself in the councils of Christ; nor in the councils of the Lords, - Christ's representatives.

What was I in the century past: I only find myself today. The vagabonds, the hazy wars are gone. The inferior race has swept over all - the People, as they put it, Reason; Nation and Science.

Ah, Science! Everything is taken from the past. For the body and the soul, - the last sacrament, - we have Medicine and Philosophy, household remedies and folk songs rearrainged. And royal entertainments, and games that kings forbid! Geography, Cosmography, Mechanics, Chemistry!...

Science, the new nobility! Progress. The world moves!... And why shouldn't it?

We have visions of numbers. We are moving toward the Spirit. What I say is oracular and absolutely right. I understand, and since I cannot express myself except in pagan terms, I would rather keep quiet.

Pagan blood returns! The Spirit is at hand, why does Christ not help me, and grant my soul nobility and freedom. Ah! but the Gospel belongs to the past! The Gospel! The Gospel.

I wait gluttinously for God. I have been of an inferior race for ever and ever.

And now I am on the beaches of Brittany. Let cities light their lamps in the evening. My daytime is done; I am leaving Europe. The air of the sea will burn my lungs; lost climates will turn my skin to leather. To swim, to pulverize grass, to hunt, above all to smoke; to drink strong drinks, as strong as molten ore, - as did those dear ancestors around their fires.

I will come back with limbs of iron, with dark skin, and angry eyes: in this mask, they will think I belong to a strong race. I will have gold: I will be brutal and indolent. Women nurse these ferocious invalids come back from the tropics. I will become involved in politics. Saved.

Now I am accursed, I detest my native land. The best thing is a drunken sleep, stretched out on some strip of shore.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

But no one leaves. - Let us set out once more on our native roads, burdened with my vice, that vice that since the age of reason has driven roots of suffering into my side - that towers to heaven, beats me, hurls me down, drags me on.

Ultimate innocence, final timidity. All's said. Carry no more my loathing and treacheries before the world.

Come on! Marching, burdens, the desert, boredom and anger.

Hire myself to whom? What beasts adore? What sacred images destroy? What hearts shall I break? What lie maintain? - Through what blood wade?

Better to keep away from justice. - A hard life, outright stupor, - with a dried-out fist to lift the coffin lid, lie down, and suffocate. No old age this way, no danger: terror is very un-French.

- Ah! I am so forsaken I will offer at any shrine impulses toward perfection.

Oh my self-denial, my marvelous Charity! my Selfless love! And still here below!

De Profundis Domine, what an ass I am!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

When I was still a little child, I admired the hardened convict on whom the prison door will always close; I used to visit the bars and the rented rooms his presence had consecrated; I saw with his eyes the blue sky and the flower-filled work of the fields; I followed his fatal scent through city streets. He had more strength than the saints, more sense than any explorer - and he, he alone! was witness to his glory and his rightness.

Along the open road on winter nights, homeless, cold, and hungry, one voice gripped my frozen heart: ""Weakness or strength: you exist, that is strength. You don't know where you are going or why you are going, go in everywhere, answer everyone. No one will kill you, any more than if you were a corpse."" In the morning my eyes were so vacant and my face so dead, that the people I met may not even have seen me.

In cities, mud went suddenly red and black, like a mirror when a lamp in the next room moves, like treasure in the forest! Good luck, I cried, and I saw a sea of flames and smoke rise to heaven; and left and right, all wealth exploded like a billion thunderbolts.

But orgies and the companionship of women were impossible for me. Not even a friend. I saw myself before an angry mob, facing a firing squad, weeping out sorrows they could not understand, and pardoning! - like Joan of Arc! - ""Priests, professors and doctors, you are mistaken in delivering me into the hands of the law. I have never been one of you; I have never been a Christian; I belong to the race that sang on the scaffold; I do not understand your laws; I have no moral sense; I am a brute; you are making a mistake...""

Yes, my eyes are closed to your light. I am an animal, a nigger. But I can be saved. You are fake niggers; maniacs, savages, misers, all of you. Businessman, you're a nigger; judge, you're a nigger; general, you're a nigger; emperor, old scratch-head, you're a nigger: you've drunk a liquor no one taxes, from Satan's still. - This nation is inspired by fever and cancer. Invalids and old men are so respectable that they ask to be boiled. - The best thing is to quit this continent where madness prowls, out to supply hostages for these wretches. I will enter the true kingdom of the sons of Cham.

Do I understand nature? Do I understand myself? No more words. I shroud dead men in my stomach.... Shouts, drums, dance, dance, dance! I can't even imagine the hour when the white men land, and I will fall into nothingness.

Thirst and hunger, shouts, dance, dance, dance!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The white men are landing. Cannons! Now we must be baptized, get dressed, and go to work.

My heart has been stabbed by grace. Ah! I hadn't thought this would happen!

But I haven't done anything wrong. My days will be easy, and I will be spared repentance. I will not have had the torments of the soul half-dead to the Good, where austure light rises again like funeral candles. The fate of a first-born son, a premature coffin covered with shining tears. No doubt, perversion is stupid, vice is stupid; rottenness must always be cast away. But the clock must learn to strike more than hours of pure pain! Am I to be carried away like a child, to play in paradise, forgetting all this misery!

Quick! Are there any other lives? - Sleep for the rich is impossible. Wealth has always lived openly. divine love alone confers the keys of knowledge. I see that nature is only a show of kindness. Farewell chimeras, ideals and errors.

The reasonable song of angels rises from the rescue ship: it is divine love. - Two loves! I may die of earthly love, die of devotion. I have left behind creatures whose grief will grow at my going! You choose me from among the castaways, aren't those who remain my friends?

Save them!

I am reborn in reason. The world is good. I will bless life. I will love my brothers. There are no longer childhood promises. Nor the hope of escaping old age and death. God is my strength, and I praise God.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Boredom is no longer my love. Rage, perversion, madness, whose every impulse and disaster I know, - my burden is set down entire. Let us appraise with clear heads the extent of my innocence.

I am no longer able to ask for the consolation of a beating. I don't imagine I'm off on a honeymoon with Jesus Christ as my father-in-law.

I am no prisoner of my own reason. I have said: God. I want freedom within salvation: how shall I go about it? A taste for frivolity has left me. No further need for divine love or for devotion to duty. I do not regret the age of emotion and feeling. To each his own reason, contempt, Charity: I keep my place at the top of the angelic ladder of good sense.

As for settled happiness, domestic or not... no, I can't. I am too dissipated, too weak. Work makes life blossom, an old idea, not mine; my life doesn't weigh enough, it drifts off and floats far beyond action, that third pole of the world.

What an old maid I'm turning into, to lack the courage to love death!

If only God would grant me that celestial calm, etherial calm, and prayer, - like the saints of old. - The Saints! They were strong! Anchorites, artists of a kind we no longer need!

Does this farce have no end? My innocence is enough to make me cry. Life is the farce we all must play.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Stop it! this is your punishment. - Forward march!

Ah! my lungs burn, my temples roar! Night rolls in my eyes, beneath this sun! My heart... my arms and legs...

Where are we going? To battle? I am weak! the others go on ahead. Tools, weapons... give me time!...

Fire! Fire at me! Here! or I'll give myself up. - Cowards! - I'll kill myself! I'll throw myself beneath the horses' hooves!

Ah!...

- I'll get used to it.

That would be the French way, the path of honor!","I have pale blue eyes, a narrow brain, and awkwardness in competition. I think","'A Season in Hell: Bad Blood' by Arthur Rimbaud is the second of nine sections that make up Rimbaud's long, complex, and deeply metaphorical poem. Throughout this poem, the speaker bounces from experience to experience. The running theme throughout is that of dissatisfaction. He expresses his anger with his lineage and his desire to get away from his ancestors. The speaker does not want to be part of the “inferior” French race and continually states that he's going to run away. But, this doesn't make him happy, even when he's mentally able to do so. He's still invisible to the world—an outsider."

Slept in the bed of Autumn.


At dawn I unite with the breeze
To announce the coming of light;

Is scented with my fragrance.

Night watch over me, and as I
Awaken I stare at the sun, which is

The poem begins with the speaker stating that the poem is not being narrated from the perspective of a human being. If one does not consider the title, the identity of the speaker is a mystery at first. The poem will provide a great amount of context through its text which will eventually bring one to the correct conclusion. The speaker is talking through the voice of a flower. The first stanzas describe when it is flowers are most active and beneficial to the world. They spreads their fragrances through the air and help to announce the sunrise alongside the birds. The second half of the poem speaks on how flowers are used for different occasions. The speaker says that “I am…” used in a range of objects and events, alongside the living and the dead. In the final lines the flower-speaker asserts an opinion that humankind needs to look to flowers for advice on how to face the world optimistically. "

The poem begins with the speaker describing how up until now his “spirit” had been sealed off. His mind and soul had been protected from the realization that his love, Lucy, was going to be subject to aging, just like everyone else. Because he never actively acknowledged this fact he lived without “human fears.” His lack of fear made him unprepared for the shock of reality when his love died. It had seemed to him, while she was still alive, and his spirit was in that trance-like state, that Lucy could not “feel / The touch of earthly years.” Time could not affect her as it does everyone else. This illusion was shattered. The second stanza of the poem speaks of this realization. His love now has “no motion” or forced to move through the world with. Additionally, time and death have taken her sight and hearing from her. Aging has done to her what it does to every other living thing and she has become a true part of the earth. Just as the “rocks, and stones, and trees” change with time, so now, the speaker sees, does Lucy."

Throughout the four simple stanzas of the poem, the speaker explores two different, contrasting, ways of being. One can either be alone or they can be together with another person.

In the poem 'Flash Crimson,' Sandburg begins with a pleading commentary on the hardships a speaker desires in life. He indirectly renounces all worldly desires and vanity. In his statements, the speaker's assurance seems to come from his conviction that his afterlife will be the best of the best. Sandburg also explains that regardless of a person's death, their legacy, deeds, kindness, and memories will remain on earth forever."

And leaps me through his paper hoops
A little higher every time.
Tempts me to think I’ll grow a proper
Singing cricket or grass-hopper
Making prodigious jumps in air
While shaken crowds about me stare
Aghast, and I sing, growing bolder

Older than the plains and hills,

He sings to you from window sills.
At you he roars, or he will coo,
He shouts and screams when hell is hot,
Riding on the shell and shot.
He smites you down, he succours you,
And where you seek him, he is not.

Like Janus—calm, benignant, this;
That, grim and scowling: his beard spreads
From chin to chin: this god has power
Immeasurable at every hour:
He first taight lovers how to kiss,
He brings down sunshine after shower,
Thunder and hate are his also,
He is YES and he is NO.
The black beard spoke and said to me,
‘Human fraility though you be,
Yet shout and crack your whip, be harsh!
They’ll obey you in the end:
Hill and field, river and marsh
Shall obey you, hop and skip
At the terrour of your whip,
To your gales of anger bend.’

But sing and laugh and easily run
Through the wide airs of my plain,
Bathe in my waters, drink my sun,
And draw my creatures with soft song;
They shall follow you along
Graciously with no doubt or pain.’

Black as pitch and white as snow,
Love me, hate me, reconcile

This poem compares poetry to God. The poet has started to know at last that what he tries to measure is something great hence immeasurable. With the help of poetry, he can leap higher than he ever thought before. The poet thinks poetry was there even before the creation as if it is God who made this whole universe. Thereafter the poet goes on to describe the nature of poetry. Comparing it to the Greek god Janus, he says it has two heads conjoined together. One face symbolizes creation and another destruction just like God. If the speaker wants to be a poet he has to establish a balance between the two qualities in poetry. "

Riding Westward' by John Donne describes a speaker's spiritual transformation and fear of confronting God on Good Friday. The poem begins with the speaker describing how the human soul exists within one sphere and the physical world another. He states that most people spend all their time in the latter. This poem is the moment when the speaker, and the poet himself, decides to turn to the spiritual side of life. In the following lines he imagines what it would be like to observe the crucifixion and admits to himself that he doesn't have the strength to do so. This is a source of shame for the speaker who wants to become close to God, still he is unable to even face the image in his head. By the end of the poem, he asks God to punish him for his weakness and therefore grant him the strength to look at death."
172,172,172,"Where the quiet-coloured end of evening smiles,
Miles and miles
On the solitary pastures where our sheep
Half-asleep
Tinkle homeward thro' the twilight, stray or stop
As they crop—
Was the site once of a city great and gay,
(So they say)
Of our country's very capital, its prince
Ages since
Held his court in, gathered councils, wielding far
Peace or war.

Now the country does not even boast a tree,
As you see,
To distinguish slopes of verdure, certain rills
From the hills
Intersect and give a name to, (else they run
Into one)
Where the domed and daring palace shot its spires
Up like fires
O'er the hundred-gated circuit of a wall
Bounding all
Made of marble, men might march on nor be prest
Twelve abreast.

And such plenty and perfection, see, of grass
Never was!
Such a carpet as, this summer-time, o'er-spreads
And embeds
Every vestige of the city, guessed alone,
Stock or stone—
Where a multitude of men breathed joy and woe
Long ago;
Lust of glory pricked their hearts up, dread of shame
Struck them tame;
And that glory and that shame alike, the gold
Bought and sold.

Now—the single little turret that remains
On the plains,
By the caper overrooted, by the gourd
Overscored,
While the patching houseleek's head of blossom winks
Through the chinks—
Marks the basement whence a tower in ancient time
Sprang sublime,
And a burning ring, all round, the chariots traced
As they raced,
And the monarch and his minions and his dames
Viewed the games.

And I know, while thus the quiet-coloured eve
Smiles to leave
To their folding, all our many-tinkling fleece
In such peace,
And the slopes and rills in undistinguished grey
Melt away—
That a girl with eager eyes and yellow hair
Waits me there
In the turret whence the charioteers caught soul
For the goal,
When the king looked, where she looks now, breathless, dumb
Till I come.

But he looked upon the city, every side,
Far and wide,
All the mountains topped with temples, all the glades'
Colonnades,
All the causeys, bridges, aqueducts,—and then
All the men!
When I do come, she will speak not, she will stand,
Either hand
On my shoulder, give her eyes the first embrace
Of my face,
Ere we rush, ere we extinguish sight and speech
Each on each.

In one year they sent a million fighters forth
South and North,
And they built their gods a brazen pillar high
As the sky
Yet reserved a thousand chariots in full force—
Gold, of course.
O heart! oh blood that freezes, blood that burns!

For whole centuries of folly, noise and sin!
Shut them in,
With their triumphs and their glories and the rest!

In the first lines of 'Love Among the Ruins,' the speaker describes walking in a field and how in that field, sheep roam where a great city used to stand. It's all collapsed now, with nothing remaining but a single turret. This one turret comes to symbolize the city (which the speaker imagines in detail) throughout the poem. The city was filled with sin, greed, lust, and the desire to attain power at any cost. It's gone now, something the speaker sees as a good thing, and has been replaced by a natural, quiet landscape. He imagines a woman in the turret waiting for him and contracts their quiet love against what used to take place in the tower. The poem concludes with the speaker determining that “Love is best.”"

'Blame not my Lute!' by Sir Thomas Wyatt talks about not blaming the poet's lute if its sound reminds the lady of her passivity for the poet. The lute, being an instrument, sounds how the user uses it. Therefore, it will be the lady's mistake if she thinks the lute itself is making such heart-wrenching sounds. However, the poet makes it clear why he uses his lute in such a manner. The lady who has broken his heart is the sole cause for giving birth to the spiteful emotions in the poet's naive heart. Moreover, the poet is giving an exact answer to the lady's cruel response. At last, the poet tells the lady to rectify her arrogance to change the tune of the poet's verse. Apart from that, if she likes the poet's songs, she can blush expressing her true feelings for the poet and his works."

The poem begins with the lioness entering an intensely realistic dream after having eaten. The meal has sent her a few moments of bliss in which she imagines herself dozing in the desert of Africa. It is there that she is able to live the life that she wants. It is not clear in the first stanza that she is actually living in an enclosure, this twist is revealed in the second stanza. It begins with the image of the bars of her cage, and the onlookers, vanishing as the lioness sinks deeper into her dreams. There, she is able to forget about the sawdust that acts as her bedding and ignore the fleas that attack her. This dream soon lifts though and she is only left with the memory of the bliss she experienced. This desire for this pleasure is so great that if she could, she would “bound” at this “freedom” and drink it “like blood.” She would, if she was able, put her whole heart into attaining freedom."

This poem portrays the claustrophobic interiors, oblique and vertical lines (especially in regards to lights and shadows), and urban environments of the American film noir. Ashbery describes these things by using the images of “Venetian blind on the painted wall,” “Shadows of the snake-plant and cacti, the plaster animals,” etc. Another unique characteristic of the black and white classic crime dramas that he depicts in the poem is the infamous femme fatale in the line “In bra and panties she sidles to the window.” Ashbery also critiques the movie genre by saying that they have similar endings: “Why must it always end this way?” According to him, several still and silent scenes in the library or of the telephone are lost in the plot and signify little. Whatsoever, Ashbery also appreciates the artistic skills it takes to make those films, i.e., to leave out specific details and to maintain the air of secrecy and mystery, which was crucial for these movies."

Within those four stanzas, readers can infer that the distress comes from a bad relationship that either has ended or should end and that the person hearing this advice is still suffering from the sadness of the experience. Regardless, Walcott assures this person—this “you”—that not only will things get better, but that the overall state of things will improve in the wake of this relationship. The reason for this seems to be the main theme of the poem as the speaker insists, again and again, that who this person has become does not accurately represent who they truly are, but one day, their true self will return. On that day, they will be happy again since only in embracing who they are can they fully be content."

And one day as his lions fought, sat looking on the court;

And truly 'twas a gallant thing to see that crowning show,
Valour and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below.

They bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind went with their paws;
With wallowing might and stifled roar they rolled on one another;

The poem begins with the speaker describing the event that the royal court, the king included, are attending. It is a fight between two lions and all are there to see it play out. The king himself, Francis, is a fan of this particular “sport,” but his attention is split. He is amazed by the brutality of the fight and the fact that he is able to observe it from safety. On the other hand, he is distracted by the beauty of one for whom he “sighs.” She is the lover of another lord. The lady herself is distracted by the valor of the king and decided to set a task for her lover. She drops her glove into the lion pit in the hopes that he will jump in and retrieve it for her. He does just this but is not pleased with her actions. He throws her glove in her face and leaves the arena. He does not believe that any true lover would set “such a task.”"

From maple’s topmost branch the brown twig throws.
I read these pregnant signs, know what they mean:
I know that thou art making ready to go.
Oh stay! I fled a land where fields are green
Always, and palms wave gently to and fro,
And winds are balmy, blue brooks ever sheen,
To ease my heart of its impassioned woe.","Stay, season of calm love and soulful snows!

The next few lines of the poem describe all the signs of the coming spring; the days grow longer and warmer, animals begin to stir, and the land begins to come back to life. The narrator states that he knows what all these signs mean and that he knows that spring has arrived. He then again begs winter to stay and begins describing his homeland. He states that he fled a tropical landscape, where it is always hot and palm trees grow. His familiarity with this kind of climate makes him yearn for the calm cold months."

The poem starts with twelve and counts down to one. The twelve apostles are the first part of the Bible referenced. Then, the poem goes on to talk about those who went to heaven, the ten commandments, and more. There are far more obscure references, perhaps to the planets and star clusters, midway through the poem. Finally, it concludes with an allusion to the “one,” which most readers take to mean God."

Cavafy begins by focusing on the speech of 'You', Cavafy directly quoting from the person he is talking to. This person, although unknown, could be Cavafy talking directly to himself, trying to snap out of the rhetoric that tell him to simply run form his problems. The first stanza of the poem sets out what is going on, with the quoted speaker deciding that his mind has gone soft living in the city he does, seeking escape. The speaker suggests that it is not their fault that their years have been wasted, putting the blame onto the city that they live within. The second stanza of the poem replies to the speaker of the first, undoing this ridiculous notion. Cavafy suggests that it is not the city that has lead to this 'waste' of life, but rather the speaker themselves having wasted their time. Changing the city will not change the mindset of this person, with Cavafy suggesting that they must instead alter their outlook on life for anything to change. Again, change comes from within, it is not something you can force through a radical change of locations. "

The poem takes the reader through “feeding time” in the geriatric ward of a hospital and the opinions of doctors and nurses. The speaker depicts the residents of the ward as cabbages and mindless cells at which they blow oxygen. She very clearly sees this period in one's life as torturous and purposeless. The speaker advocates, in varying degrees of authenticity, for an end to prolonged life."

The line length is similar throughout the poem but the amount of syllables varies from line to line giving the poem a stilted feel, this possibly helps to represent the up and down nature of having an affair. The subject of the poem is comedic but it's really a black comedy. The tone, therefore, is light hearted but a little shocking in places. Rhyme is used throughout the poem and this helps to emphasize the humorous nature of the poem. The rhyme pattern for the first two stanzas utilizes end rhymes every other line (-A-A-A) but in the final stanza, it appears to be (ABABAB) although some of the rhymes throughout are half-rhymes."

'Whoso List to Hunt' by Sir Thomas Wyatt is a sonnet that talks about a hind that is impossible to be captured. In the first section or octave, the poet refers to his mental state after following the hind before. It was a fruitless venture that he undertook. Neither he nor others can catch it. The poet became so exhausted that he says it was like catching air with a net. It soon becomes evident the deer is a woman and the speaker: one of her suitors. However, in the sestet, the poet provides the reason. Here, he says why the hind can't be caught. As it belongs to Caesar, a likely reference to Henry VIII and already his property. So, those who are trying to catch it, can't own the creature."

Or close the wall up with our English dead.

But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
Then imitate the action of the tiger;
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
Let pry through the portage of the head
Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it
As fearfully as doth a galled rock
O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.

Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:
Follow your spirit, and upon this charge
Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'",The poem is a poem of a man who is a man of modest stillness,"Henry gives his men a stark choice: either summon the energy to push through the breach or give up, die and leave it to be filled with the corpses of the “English dead.” He reminds them that there is no room for the “modest stillness and humility” that might be useful in peacetime. Instead, they must “imitate the action of the tiger” and make themselves think and look physically terrifying, by using their full height, baring their teeth, and flaring their nostrils. He advises them to make their eyes look like a “brass cannon” peaking out from a warship and to hold their foreheads high and “fearfully” so they appear like an angry cliff or “galled rock” over the ocean. In the second part of the 'Once more unto the breach' speech, Henry flatters his men, the “noblest English” and urges them to “Dishonour not your mothers” and make their families proud of them by being “men of grosser blood” who are ready for war. By the time the speech ends, the soldiers are ready to storm Harfleur and charge through its walls on Henry's famous rallying cry, “God for Harry, for England and St George!”"

Their shoes were clean and neat —
And this was odd, because, you know,
They hadn't any feet.
Four other Oysters followed them,
And yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more —
All hopping through the frothy waves,
And scrambling to the shore.

Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
Conveniently low:

Of shoes — and ships — and sealing-wax —
Of cabbages — and kings —
And why the sea is boiling hot —
And whether pigs have wings.'

Before we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath,
And all of us are fat!'

The poem begins with the Walrus and his companion the carpenter mourning the presence of so much sand on the beach. They cry over it, unable to come up with a good way to get rid of it. As quickly as their tears began they stop and begin speaking with some oysters. These oysters walk with them, although they do not have legs, down the beach. They pause, decide to have a discussion, and then decide to eat. It is at this point that there is a change in the poem and it is revealed that the two tricked the oysters into coming with them in order to eat them. They distract them the best they can and then eat them all before they remember to apologize."

In the first lines of this piece the speaker addresses “you”. The second person narration means that the reader is included in the poem. They are part of the story and are therefore asked to consider themselves within the same situation as the intended listener. The speaker describes how this person reached a point in their life when they knew “what they had to do”. Voices follow this person, trying to get them to return to the past and focus on them instead. But, this listener does not give in. They continue to move forward and brave the uneven path that is set out before them. The speaker states that it was “already late enough”. The listener had wasted enough of their life paying attention to the voices. Now there is no time to spare in moving into the new world. Once the old voice has dissipated, “you” were able to hear a new voice. It took a moment to realize that this voice was “your own”. The listener moves away from the world they knew, and “deeper and deeper” into a new one. The only thing they have on their mind at this point is to save their own life."

192,192,192,"Our England is a garden that is full of stately views,
 Of borders, beds and shrubberies and lawns and avenues,
 With statues on the terraces and peacocks strutting by;
 But the Glory of the Garden lies in more than meets the eye. 

For where the old thick laurels grow, along the thin red wall,
 You’ll find the tool- and potting-sheds which are the heart of all,
 The cold-frames and the hot-houses, the dungpits and the tanks,
 The rollers, carts and drain-pipes, with the barrows and the planks. 

And there you’ll see the gardeners, the men and ’Prentice boys
 Told off to do as they are bid and do it without noise;
 For, except when seeds are planted and we shout to scare the birds,
 The Glory of the Garden it abideth not in words. 

And some can pot begonias and some can bud a rose,
 And some are hardly fit to trust with anything that grows;
 But they can roll and trim the lawns and sift the sand and loam,
 For the Glory of the Garden occupieth all who come. 

Our England is a garden, and such gardens are not made
 By singing:—“Oh, how beautiful!” and sitting in the shade,
 While better men than we go out and start their working lives
 At grubbing weeds from gravel-paths with broken dinner-knives. 

There’s not a pair of legs so thin, there’s not a head so thick,
 There’s not a hand so weak and white, nor yet a heart so sick,
 But it can find some needful job that’s crying to be done,
 For the Glory of the Garden glorifieth every one. 

Then seek your job with thankfulness and work till further orders,
 If it’s only netting strawberries or killing slugs on borders;
 And when your back stops aching and your hands begin to harden,
 You will find yourself a partner in the Glory of the Garden.

 That half a proper gardener’s work is done upon his knees,

The poem begins with the speaker describing England as a garden with “stately views”. It has beautiful shrubs and peacocks, but there are also tool sheds and more practical structures. In amongst these sites, a visitor will see the gardeners, every one of which has a different job that is suited perfectly for them. Some might tend to the growing plants while others move soil and sand. They are also pleasant, quiet, and ready to do as they are asks. These are the hardworking citizens of the country, doing what they can to contribute to the greater good of their homeland. Kipling's speaker also makes sure to emphasize the fact that everyone has a job and is therefore occupied by the garden. There is no one who is sitting around and relaxes, everyone contributes. The last stanzas are directed at the reader or listener, telling them that they too need to make sure that they're doing everything they can for the country. It might be hard work at first, but eventually, one's hands will grow strong and their backs, painless. They too will be brought into the glory of the garden, and therefore the glory of God."

For example, Stafford refers to the creeping of sunlight on the floor, the scent of old wood, and the soft sounds that fill the air. By referring to these images, he sets the mood of the poem. Moving on to the following lines, his speaker highlights the fact that the most important gift of our lives is the air we breathe. One has to respect that gift without thinking about any worldly rewards. The moment people wait for never comes. It is up to them how they try to find exceptional satisfaction in the most ordinary of moments."

Among the famous palaces and cities of renown,

In the land of youth and freedom, beyond the ocean bars,
Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of stars.

And Paris is a woman's town, with flowers in her hair;
And it's sweet to dream in Venice, and it's great to study Rome;
But when it comes to living there is no place like home.

I like the gardens of Versailles with flashing foutains filled;

But the glory of the Present is to make the Future free-

He’s emotionally pricked, experiencing pain when he should receive love or connection in return. No matter how gentle or tender he is, the bramble always pricks him."
197,197,197,"Listen, my children, and you shall hear
Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-Five:
Hardly a man is now alive
Who remembers that famous day and year.

He said to his friend, “If the British march
By land or sea from the town to-night,
Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch
Of the North-Church-tower, as a signal-light,—
One if by land, and two if by sea;
And I on the opposite shore will be,
Ready to ride and spread the alarm
Through every Middlesex village and farm,
For the country-folk to be up and to arm.”

Then he said “Good night!” and with muffled oar
Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,
Just as the moon rose over the bay,
Where swinging wide at her moorings lay
The Somerset, British man-of-war:
A phantom ship, with each mast and spar
Across the moon, like a prison-bar,
And a huge black hulk, that was magnified
By its own reflection in the tide.

Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street
Wanders and watches with eager ears,
Till in the silence around him he hears
The muster of men at the barrack door,
The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,
And the measured tread of the grenadiers
Marching down to their boats on the shore.

Then he climbed to the tower of the church,
Up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,
To the belfry-chamber overhead,
And startled the pigeons from their perch
On the sombre rafters, that round him made
Masses and moving shapes of shade,—
By the trembling ladder, steep and tall,
To the highest window in the wall,
Where he paused to listen and look down
A moment on the roofs of the town,
And the moonlight flowing over all.

Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,
In their night-encampment on the hill,
Wrapped in silence so deep and still
That he could hear, like a sentinel’s tread,
The watchful night-wind, as it went
Creeping along from tent to tent,
And seeming to whisper, “All is well!”
A moment only he feels the spell
Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread
Of the lonely belfry and the dead;
For suddenly all his thoughts are bent
On a shadowy something far away,
Where the river widens to meet the bay,—
A line of black, that bends and floats
On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.

Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,
Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride,
On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.
Now he patted his horse’s side,
Now gazed on the landscape far and near,
Then impetuous stamped the earth,
And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;
But mostly he watched with eager search
The belfry-tower of the old North Church,
As it rose above the graves on the hill,
Lonely and spectral and sombre and still.
And lo! as he looks, on the belfry’s height,
A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!
He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,
But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight
A second lamp in the belfry burns!

A hurry of hoofs in a village-street,
A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,
And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark
Struck out by a steed that flies fearless and fleet:
That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,
The fate of a nation was riding that night;
And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,
Kindled the land into flame with its heat.

He has left the village and mounted the steep,
And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,
Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;
And under the alders, that skirt its edge,
Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,
Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.

It was twelve by the village clock
When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.
He heard the crowing of the cock,
And the barking of the farmer’s dog,
And felt the damp of the river-fog,
That rises when the sun goes down.

It was one by the village clock,
When he galloped into Lexington.
He saw the gilded weathercock
Swim in the moonlight as he passed,
And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,
Gaze at him with a spectral glare,
As if they already stood aghast
At the bloody work they would look upon.

It was two by the village clock,
When he came to the bridge in Concord town.
He heard the bleating of the flock,
And the twitter of birds among the trees,
And felt the breath of the morning breeze
Blowing over the meadows brown.
And one was safe and asleep in his bed
Who at the bridge would be first to fall,
Who that day would be lying dead,
Pierced by a British musket-ball.

You know the rest. In the books you have read,
How the British Regulars fired and fled,—
How the farmers gave them ball for ball,
From behind each fence and farmyard-wall,
Chasing the red-coats down the lane,
Then crossing the fields to emerge again
Under the trees at the turn of the road,
And only pausing to fire and load.

So through the night rode Paul Revere;
And so through the night went his cry of alarm
To every Middlesex village and farm,—
A cry of defiance, and not of fear,
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
And a word that shall echo forevermore!
For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,
Through all our history, to the last,
In the hour of darkness and peril and need,
The people will waken and listen to hear
The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,
And the midnight message of Paul Revere.","The midnight ride of Paul Revere, On the eighteenth of April, in","Paul Revere's Ride' by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow is a straightforward and inspiring poem that describes the courageous ride of Paul Revere. The poem follows Paul Revere on his midnight ride. The events occur in chronological order and Longfellow gives sufficient time to develop the drama of every moment. The most dramatic and important part of the plan comes as Revere rides quickly through the countryside from village to village. He's riding with the warning that the British are coming by sea. At the end of the poem, the poet alludes to the historical importance of this moment and how, just like Revere's horse, the facts of this evening will permeate history for years to come."

Milne's work, there is an element to the poetry which is only going to be truly accessible to an adult reader. In this case, it is the theme of identity and a search for satisfaction in that identity. This plays out very clearly in lines 1-10 of 'Now We Are Six.' The young child speaking is experiencing what every member of the human race goes through as they age, a process of seeking, learning, and hopefully becoming wiser. There is a youthful ignorance contained within 'Now We Are Six' that is charming. This child is still under the impression that they will reach an age in which everything is perfect. They believe it is at “six” that they want to remain for the rest of their life. Perhaps at that moment they really believed that, but with the further shifting of time, landscapes, people, and attitudes they, along with everyone else aging, will come to realize that there is no one perfect year."

In the second half, the narrator comes to the moment he loves. He speaks of the moon rising over the city and lighting up the tops of the trees. When this happens he is determined to climb to the top of the trees and bask in the moonlight. His “blood” will be cooled by this action and his whole spirit lifted. "

befall these children. They will stay out late

forever, pumped on youth and ecstasy,
on alloy, bass and arrogance, and speed

the wide motorways, never having need
to race back home, for work next day, to bed.

charged with pulsing juice which, even yet,
fills every pair of Calvin’s and each thong,

The lines conform to a rhyming pattern of ABABCDEDCE, changing end sounds from stanza to stanza. Turnbull also chose to make use of a very traditional rhyme scheme, iambic pentameter. This means that each line is separated into five sets of two beats. The first of these is unstressed and the second stressed. This is the same form used by Keats in ‘Ode to a Grecian Urn.’ His poem follows the same rhyme scheme and is also written in iambic pentameter. Both poems, as stated in the title, are “odes.” An ode is a kind of lyric poetry that is sometimes meant to be sung. It is generally addressed to a natural subject and formatted in a specific kind of meter."

Unfortunately, the prey is none other than the speaker himself. The lady told him that she had no feelings left in her heart. It was better to leave. The years fled by.

Amoretti was published in 1595, and it depicts Spenser’s courtship and eventual marriage to Elizabeth Boyle. In Sonnet 54, Spenser uses the theatre to describe his situation as a lover; the lyrical voice is the actor who plays various roles and his loved one is the unmoved spectator. Thus, Sonnet 54 is a conceit that relates the lyrical voice’s actions to that of the theatre.

Sonnet 54 is a Spenserian sonnet, formed by three interlocked quatrains and a couplet. The rhyme scheme is ABAB BCBC CDCD EE and it has iambic pentameter. The main theme in Sonnet 54 is unreciprocated love and the tone of the poem shows the lyrical voice’s frustration passing through annoyance and anger."

Of the sunken sun,
O'er which clouds are bright'ning,
Thou dost float and run;
Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.
The pale purple even
Melts around thy flight;
Like a star of Heaven,
In the broad day-light
Thou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delight,
Keen as are the arrows
Of that silver sphere,
Whose intense lamp narrows
In the white dawn clear
Until we hardly see, we feel that it is there.
All the earth and air
With thy voice is loud,
As, when night is bare,
From one lonely cloud
The moon rains out her beams, and Heaven is overflow'd.
What thou art we know not;
What is most like thee?
From rainbow clouds there flow not
Drops so bright to see
As from thy presence showers a rain of melody.
Like a Poet hidden
In the light of thought,
Singing hymns unbidden,
Till the world is wrought
To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not:
Like a high-born maiden
In a palace-tower,
Soothing her love-laden
Soul in secret hour
With music sweet as love, which overflows her bower:
Like a glow-worm golden
In a dell of dew,
Scattering unbeholden
Its aëreal hue
Among the flowers and grass, which screen it from the view:
Like a rose embower'd
In its own green leaves,
By warm winds deflower'd,
Till the scent it gives
Makes faint with too much sweet those heavy-winged thieves:
Sound of vernal showers
On the twinkling grass,
Rain-awaken'd flowers,
All that ever was
Joyous, and clear, and fresh, thy music doth surpass.
Teach us, Sprite or Bird,
What sweet thoughts are thine:
I have never heard
Praise of love or wine
That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.
Chorus Hymeneal,
Or triumphal chant,
Match'd with thine would be all
But an empty vaunt,
A thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want.
What objects are the fountains
Of thy happy strain?
What fields, or waves, or mountains?
What shapes of sky or plain?
What love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain?
With thy clear keen joyance
Languor cannot be:
Shadow of annoyance
Never came near thee:
Thou lovest: but ne'er knew love's sad satiety.
Waking or asleep,
Thou of death must deem
Things more true and deep
Than we mortals dream,
Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?
We look before and after,
And pine for what is not:
Our sincerest laughter
With some pain is fraught;
Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
Yet if we could scorn
Hate, and pride, and fear;
If we were things born
Not to shed a tear,
I know not how thy joy we ever should come near.
Better than all measures
Of delightful sound,
Better than all treasures
That in books are found,
Thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground!
Teach me half the gladness
That thy brain must know,
Such harmonious madness
From my lips would flow
The world should listen then, as I am listening now.","'Bird thou never wert, That from Heaven, or near","'To a Skylark' by Percy Bysshe Shelley is an ode to the “blithe” essence of a singing skylark and how human beings are unable to ever reach that same bliss. The poem begins with the speaker spotting a skylark flying above him. He can hear the song clearly. The bird's song “unpremeditated” is unplanned and beautiful. Shelley is stunned by the music produced by the bird and entranced by its movement as it flies into the clouds and out of sight. Although he can no longer see it, he is still able to hear it and feel its presence. The bird represents the pure, unbridled happiness that Shelley is desperately seeking. This desperation comes through in the next stanzas. The poet then embarks on a number of metaphors through which he is hoping to better understand what the bird is and what he can accurately compare it to. He sees the bird as a “high-born maiden” that serenades her lover below her and spring, or “vernal,” showers that rain on the flowers below. The skylark is like “rainbow clouds” and the epitome of all “Joyous” things. The next section of the ode is used to ask the skylark to reveal what inspires it to sing such a glorious song. Is it, the poet asks, “fields, or waves, or mountains?” Could it be, he speculates, “shapes of sky or plain?” Whatever it may be, Shelley has never seen anything that could force such sounds from his own voice. He states that for a creature to have the ability to sing in such a way, it must know nothing of sorrow or “annoyance.” The bird must have the ability to see beyond life, understand death, and feel no concern about it. This is why humans may never reach the same state of happiness that the skylark exists within. “We” pine for things that we do not have, and even our “sweetest songs” are full of the “saddest thought[s].” 'To a Skylark' concludes with the poet pleading with the bird to “Teach [him] half the gladness / That thy brain must know.” Even that small amount would provide Shelley with the ability to produce “harmonious madness” that would force the world to listen to him must as raptly as he is listening to the skylark now."

In the first part of this poem, the speaker begins by conveying the curious questions of a child who is trying to understand the Hindu story of how Ganesh lost his head and gained the head of an elephant. The child wonders what happened to the elephant who gave a head and if it was possible to give the elephant a new head as well, perhaps a horse's head. Unintentionally inspired by the child's probings, the adult narrator takes the story further in imagines the sorrow that the elephant's family would experience upon seeing their fellow heard member decapitated and killed."

The poem describes through simple stanzas the loss that this young woman has suffered. Her young black lover has been lynched and strung up in a crossroads tree, an image that alludes to the death of Christ on the cross. Her heart is broken and her world transformed. God doesn't comfort her and she feels as though her prayers are useless. Now, all love is represented by that shadowed, naked body."

The poem opens with a description of his white neighbors coming to burn down his house, believing it was their right to drive him out of their neighborhood.

Tightly-folded bud,
I have wished you something
None of the others would:
Not the usual stuff

Or running off a spring
Of innocence and love —
They will all wish you that,
And should it prove possible,
Well, you’re a lucky girl.

But if it shouldn’t, then
May you be ordinary;
Have, like other women,
An average of talents:
Not ugly, not good-looking,
Nothing uncustomary

Stops all the rest from working.
In fact, may you be dull —
If that is what a skilled,
Vigilant, flexible,
Unemphasised, enthralled
Catching of happiness is called", 'I have wished you something None of the others would:'</s,"One literary analyst describes Larkin’s works: ‘Born Yesterday’. She says, “the topic of happiness—what it is, how to attain and cultivate it—is crucial to his work”. This topic is particularly obvious in ‘Born Yesterday. Larkin seems to hint that he has found a source of true happiness, and that it has nothing to do with beauty, talent, or fame. Therefore, he wishes this young girl to be plain and average, that she might achieve happiness in life.

The fact that Larkin seems to be so obsessed with the theme of happiness, could mean one of two things. Either he has found a source of true happiness, or he has simply found what is not the true source of happiness. Either way, this poem speaks volumes about life and meaning and purpose. While most people seem to think that beauty, money, fame, or intelligence is what makes a person worthwhile, Larkin points out the fallacy of this belief. He does this in a simple, yet profound way. He dedicates this poem to Sally Amis. This is the daughter of Larkin’s lifelong friend. Sally is clearly a child Larkin cares for dearly. Yet, he does not wish her to have all that the world has to offer. Rather, he wishes for her to have a simple happiness, and he believes that she will find that happiness more readily if she is plain in looks and average in intelligence (Wetzsteon)."

In the first line of the poem, the speaker begins on a positive note, describing spring and life beginning. This may be interpreted as the speaker being pregnant. She goes on, informing the reader that her life is far from ideal. Her husband goes out, drunk or on drugs, every night and has sex with prostitutes. When he comes home, she has to fear for her life and do what she can to protect herself. In an effort to stay safe from her husband and try to keep her husband off the streets, she begins tying his car keys and a $10 bill to her thigh at night. Structure and Form 'To Speak of Woe That Is in Marriage' by Robert Lowell is a fourteen-line poem that is contained within a single stanza of text. The poem is written in the form of a fourteen-line sonnet with a rhyme scheme of AABBCCDDEEFFGG. This does not conform to any of the most popular, traditional rhyme schemes poets use in sonnet writing. But, it does have elements of both a Shakespearean and Petrarchan sonnet. For example, there is a clear transition between the eighth and ninth lines, similar to those seen in Petrarchan sonnets, and the poet uses couplets as both Shakespeare and Petrarch do in their sonnets."

A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
Its loveliness increases; it will never
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils
With the green world they live in; and clear rills
That for themselves a cooling covert make
'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms
We have imagined for the mighty dead;
All lovely tales that we have heard or read:
An endless fountain of immortal drink,
Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.
Nor do we merely feel these essences
For one short hour; no, even as the trees
That whisper round a temple become soon
Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon,
The passion poesy, glories infinite,
Haunt us till they become a cheering light
Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast,
That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast;
They always must be with us, or we die.
Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I
Will trace the story of Endymion.
The very music of the name has gone
Into my being, and each pleasant scene
Is growing fresh before me as the green
Of our own valleys: so I will begin
Now while I cannot hear the city's din;
Now while the early budders are just new,
And run in mazes of the youngest hue
About old forests; while the willow trails
Its delicate amber; and the dairy pails
Bring home increase of milk. And, as the year
Grows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer
My little boat, for many quiet hours,
With streams that deepen freshly into bowers.
Many and many a verse I hope to write,
Before the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white,
Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees
Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas,
I must be near the middle of my story.
O may no wintry season, bare and hoary,
See it half finish'd: but let Autumn bold,
With universal tinge of sober gold,
Be all about me when I make an end.
And now, at once adventuresome, I send
My herald thought into a wilderness:
There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress
My uncertain path with green, that I may speed
Easily onward, thorough flowers and weed.",A thing of beauty is a joy for ever: Its loveliness increases; it,"The first book of “Endymion” by John Keats details the speaker's beliefs regarding the power of beauty and his intentions to tell the story of Endymion. The poem begins with the speaker describing, at length, the power he believes beauty holds over human life. He sees it as a guiding force that, when accepted and appreciated, enters into one's heart and helps to clear one's path through life. Once one fully knows beauty, it will never leave. It transforms the onlooker into a beautiful object. The second half of the poem describes the speaker's plan to tell the long story of Endymion, a character from Greek mythology. He announces his intentions, primes the audience for a long story, and sends out a “herald” to tell the world what is about to happen."

The speaker begins Of Many Worlds in This World by stating that the world is like a “nest of boxes.” It is made out of different-sized boxes, all placed within one another. This nesting of the world is a perfect metaphor for how the existence known to humankind lies on and within the existences of other organisms. These other worlds might be, the speaker describes, smaller than a human could ever see. They might be “Thinner and less” than anything yet known. This does not mean that they don't exist. It also doesn't mean they are not valuable or worth understanding. In the next set of lines, the speaker makes a comparison between the size of an imagined world and a “ladies ear-ring.” The “world” could be small enough to fit within or on a piece of jewelry. The speaker seems to marvel at this concept. She sees beauty in the fact that a world of “creatures,” as she describes them, could fit on a pendant, or on each of a ladies earrings.

'Anniversary' by Ted Hughes is a commemorative poem that glorifies the spirit of the poet's mother. Her soul has an angelic outlook in the poet's imagination. The poet revisits the thoughts of his mother after seeing the torn diary page marked 13 May. On it, his brother had written, “Ma died today”. But, for the poet, she is still alive, in his poetic imagination, brimming with heavenly light. There is an out-worldly feature in her voice and her complexion. Hughes can hear what his mother tells his sister who is also dead. Their conversation forms the basis of the poem and in the end, the poet imaginatively goes nearer to the weeping spirit of his mother. Sadly, she doesn't weep for him. As a jealous sibling, the poet thinks she cries only for his brother. And, she loves the poet through the thoughts of his brother."

I. THE PROLOGUE
Patting good-bye, doubtless they told the lad
He’d always show the Hun a brave man’s face;
Father would sooner him dead than in disgrace,—
Was proud to see him going, aye, and glad.
Perhaps his mother whimpered how she’d fret
Until he got a nice safe wound to nurse.
Sisters would wish girls too could shoot, charge, curse …
Brothers—would send his favourite cigarette.
Each week, month after month, they wrote the same,
Thinking him sheltered in some Y.M. Hut,
Because he said so, writing on his butt
Where once an hour a bullet missed its aim
And misses teased the hunger of his brain.
His eyes grew old with wincing, and his hand
Reckless with ague. Courage leaked, as sand
From the best sand-bags after years of rain.
But never leave, wound, fever, trench-foot, shock,
Untrapped the wretch. And death seemed still withheld
For torture of lying machinally shelled,
At the pleasure of this world’s Powers who’d run amok.
He’d seen men shoot their hands, on night patrol.
Their people never knew. Yet they were vile.
‘Death sooner than dishonour, that’s the style!’
So Father said.
II. THE ACTION
One dawn, our wire patrol
Carried him. This time, Death had not missed.
We could do nothing but wipe his bleeding cough.
Could it be accident? - Rifles go off…
Not sniped? No. (Later they found the English ball.)
III. THE POEM
It was the reasoned crisis of his soul
Against more days of inescapable thrall,
Against infrangibly wired and blind trench wall
Curtained with fire, roofed in with creeping fire,
Slow grazing fire, that would not burn him whole
But kept him for death’s promises and scoff,
And life’s half-promising, and both their riling.

Soldiers who had grown too traumatized by war, or in general wanted to be back home with their loved ones, took to hoping for what were known as 'blighty wounds' – injuries that would send them back home to England without a hope of convalescing. The more desperate of the soldiers took to shooting off their own fingers, in the hopes that they would be sent home and never called up to active duty again; however, the British Army soon caught wind of this scheme, and soldiers who were thought to have SIWs were treated like garbage. Overall, approximately 4000 soldiers were found guilty of SIWs and sentenced to long prison stays. Discover more Wilfred Owen poems."

Matthews begins with the weather, looking at the 'Haze' of the location. He moves through a group of 'student violinists', the sound of 'jackhammers', the quality of 'Granular light' that he sees. Each of the images in the poem follows a different sense, Matthews providing an in-depth depiction of the city. Stories begin to emerge from these images, a woman who 'call[s] it off' with 'a man', two cab drivers arguing in Farsi. The final few images focus on blending city and nature, the 'chill air', and 'Hail' sandwiching the city sound of 'A car alarm'. The poem provides a summer view of a city, everything inside following each other in an eternal hum."

Taken from life when life and love were new

And tears like mine will keep thy memory green,
As Isabella did her Basil-tree.","The young martyr is lain, Fair as Sebastian, and as early slain.","'The Grave of Keats' by Oscar Wilde describes the physical state of the dead poet's grave and the emotional impact that his short life had on England. The poem begins with the speaker hoping to cheer up his own, and the reader's mood, by speaking of the new world, alongside God, that Keats is now residing in. He is beyond the problems and discomforts of the world. His death was incredibly important to the speaker, he holds a saint-like stature in the speaker's mind. He continues on to say that, while viewing the spot in which Keats is buried, there are no huge trees to block out the sun, only violets that wrap around “his bones,” or more likely, tombstone. Keats is compared to Saint Sebastian, an early Christian who was martyred for his faith. Keats is often thought of as having contracted tuberculosis due to grief. In the final sestet of the poem, the speaker describes Keats as being the finest English “poet-painter” since the Greek poets of old. He made a monumental impact on the speaker's life and on his readers. He concludes by quoting the inscription on the tombstone and saying that he will do whatever it takes to keep that land green, even if he has to water it with his own tears."
227,227,227,"AN OLD STORY.

I.

It was roses, roses, all the way,
With myrtle mixed in my path like mad:
The house-roofs seemed to heave and sway,
The church-spires flamed, such flags they had,
A year ago on this very day.

II.

The air broke into a mist with bells,
The old walls rocked with the crowd and cries.
Had I said, ``Good folk, mere noise repels---
But give me your sun from yonder skies!''
They had answered, ``And afterward, what else?''

III.

Alack, it was I who leaped at the sun
To give it my loving friends to keep!
Nought man could do, have I left undone:
And you see my harvest, what I reap
This very day, now a year is run.

IV.

There's nobody on the house-tops now---
Just a palsied few at the windows set;
For the best of the sight is, all allow,
At the Shambles' Gate---or, better yet,
By the very scaffold's foot, I trow.

V.

I go in the rain, and, more than needs,
A rope cuts both my wrists behind;
And I think, by the feel, my forehead bleeds,
For they fling, whoever has a mind,
Stones at me for my year's misdeeds.

VI.

Thus I entered, and thus I go!
In triumphs, people have dropped down dead.
``Paid by the world, what dost thou owe
``Me?''---God might question; now instead,
'Tis God shall repay: I am safer so.","A year ago on this very day, I leaped at the sun, and the church","'The Patriot' by Robert Browning is a tragic, dramatic monologue about a man who dedicated his entire life to supporting his country. The poem is heavy with irony as it describes a man who had given everything up for his people and was initially revered by them, only to be killed at their hands without a second thought in the end."

The poem begins with the speaker describing a poster advertising “Prestatyn,” a resort town in Wales. When the poster had only been up for a couple of weeks, those living in the area took it upon themselves to change it. The woman’s body was drawn on, and the sexual innuendoes present in the ad were enhanced. There was more than one participant in the defacing of the ad, making the whole series of events a protest of sorts against the idea that a perfect, pure, “sunny” life is possible."

The poem starts with a stanza describing the landscape in which the speaker wants to be buried. He wants to be somewhere peaceful, away from the city and under the stars. His wishes are fulfilled, the second stanza indicates. This is seen through a three-line inscription that's included in the third stanza of what “you” chose to write on the speaker's grave."
230,230,230,"BY day the skyscraper looms in the smoke and sun and
has a soul.
Prairie and valley, streets of the city, pour people into
it and they mingle among its twenty floors and are
poured out again back to the streets, prairies and
valleys.
It is the men and women, boys and girls so poured in and
out all day that give the building a soul of dreams
and thoughts and memories.
(Dumped in the sea or fixed in a desert, who would care
for the building or speak its name or ask a policeman
the way to it?)
Elevators slide on their cables and tubes catch letters and
parcels and iron pipes carry gas and water in and
sewage out.
Wires climb with secrets, carry light and carry words,
and tell terrors and profits and loves--curses of men
grappling plans of business and questions of women
in plots of love.
Hour by hour the caissons reach down to the rock of the
earth and hold the building to a turning planet.
Hour by hour the girders play as ribs and reach out and
hold together the stone walls and floors.
Hour by hour the hand of the mason and the stuff of the
mortar clinch the pieces and parts to the shape an
architect voted.
Hour by hour the sun and the rain, the air and the rust,
and the press of time running into centuries, play
on the building inside and out and use it.
Men who sunk the pilings and mixed the mortar are laid
in graves where the wind whistles a wild song
without words
And so are men who strung the wires and fixed the pipes
and tubes and those who saw it rise floor by floor.
Souls of them all are here, even the hod carrier begging
at back doors hundreds of miles away and the brick-
layer who went to state's prison for shooting another
man while drunk.
(One man fell from a girder and broke his neck at the
end of a straight plunge--he is here--his soul has
gone into the stones of the building.)
On the office doors from tier to tier--hundreds of names
and each name standing for a face written across
with a dead child, a passionate lover, a driving
ambition for a million dollar business or a lobster's
ease of life.
Behind the signs on the doors they work and the walls
tell nothing from room to room.
Ten-dollar-a-week stenographers take letters from
corporation officers, lawyers, efficiency engineers,
and tons of letters go bundled from the building to all
ends of the earth.
Smiles and tears of each office girl go into the soul of
the building just the same as the master-men who
rule the building.
Hands of clocks turn to noon hours and each floor
empties its men and women who go away and eat
and come back to work.
Toward the end of the afternoon all work slackens and
all jobs go slower as the people feel day closing on
them.
One by one the floors are emptied. . . The uniformed
elevator men are gone. Pails clang. . . Scrubbers
work, talking in foreign tongues. Broom and water
and mop clean from the floors human dust and spit,
and machine grime of the day.
Spelled in electric fire on the roof are words telling
miles of houses and people where to buy a thing for
money. The sign speaks till midnight.
Darkness on the hallways. Voices echo. Silence
holds. . . Watchmen walk slow from floor to floor
and try the doors. Revolvers bulge from their hip
pockets. . . Steel safes stand in corners. Money
is stacked in them.
A young watchman leans at a window and sees the lights
of barges butting their way across a harbor, nets of
red and white lanterns in a railroad yard, and a span
of glooms splashed with lines of white and blurs of
crosses and clusters over the sleeping city.
By night the skyscraper looms in the smoke and the stars
and has a soul.",The skyscraper looms in the smoke and sun and has a soul.,"'Skyscraper' by Carl Sandburg is a vivid poem that describes a day within the skyscraper, each of its twenty floors. In this piece, the beauty of the Chicago city is described through the eyes of the skyscraper. Due to its magnificence, it attracts a number of people from distant places. Sandburg praises the role every section played in building this remarkable building. He includes every small worker who laid their hands and sweat in the construction of the skyscraper. Through this poem, Sandburg shows how vital the role of an individual is and how they can make a noticeable mark in the modern world. He also talks about the pain one underwent while making the building and how they are left unrecognized. Sandburg personifies the building and begins by saying that the building “has a soul.” He glorifies a day within the walls of the skyscraper and praises those who worked day and night to keep the skyscraper standing straight and firm. He indirectly indicates to society and hints at the vital role played by an individual in building the nation. Just like the building is left without soul as the day ends, so is the nation without people. Thus, people are the soul of a nation. Overall, in this poem, he meditates on the mortality of humans and the enduring nature of man-made buildings."

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins by describing what playing hopscotch is like. The pavement is hot, and so, you have to jump into the air, trying not to put both feet on the ground. She makes several allusions to the nature of the world by suggesting that good things come to those who can afford them and that “Everybody” has to be for “hisself.” The speaker makes it clear that this is more than a game of hopscotch. She's also using it to define the Black experience. Since the players are Black, they have to keep moving. Soon they'll be out of food and need to pay rent. Jobs are hard to come by, and everyone, like the hopscotch players, are contorting themselves to try to make ends meet. If you land with both feet on the ground, the game is over. The speaker concludes by saying that some believe this means she's lost the game, but she thinks it means she's won."

In this poem, Kipling paints a dystopian image of a world where the colors of the “old” have faded, and the “youngest critic” of art has died. The speaker says that after the end of the world, people would rest in their graves for an æon or more until there is a new beginning. Those who were good during their lifetime will be rewarded and given a seat in the “golden chair.” They will be the first painters to draw on a “ten-league canvas” provided by God. Their painting would take inspiration from saints. In the process of completing the picture, they will never grow tired. In the last stanza, Kipling refers back to how only God's praise and approval matter to these people most, not “money” or “fame.”"

In the first part of the poem, the poet begins by telling his lover to take a picture he's given her and use to remember him by while he's gone on a trip. He knows that the trip is going to be long and that when he comes back, he's going to look and feel different. He tells her that he can use the picture to show those who question her about their relationship what he looked like when they fell in love. He believes he'll no longer be the attractive young man she once knew. Their relationship is going to hinge on their internal, emotional connection. This will take them into the next stage of their life, and their relationship will be far stronger and more dependable than a simple attraction to what the other person looks like."

Throughout this poem, the speaker addresses his muse and chastises them for leaving him. He feels as though he's been abandoned by his ability to write sufficiently about his beloved, the Fair Youth. The speaker asks the muse to come back to him and allow him to write as he once did. He still hopes to immortalize this young man so that time's knife never touches him."

The poem is divided into three parts. The first contains a young student's plea for her teacher to stop one of their fellow students from copying their work. Rather than provide a solution, the teacher dismisses the issue and tries to get the student to solve it themselves. Throughout, the poet uses amusing and outrageous language that is meant to entertain, especially in the teacher's rather outlandish suggestions. The third part of the poem progresses in the same way, with the final issue being raised in the fifth stanza and amusingly dismissed in the sixth."

In the first lines of 'Sonnet 111,' the speaker begins by addressing Fortune. He is chastising Fortune for not providing him with the life he wanted. He is forced to cater to the public's whims. His success is based on their interest in him. The speaker feels that this has degraded him somehow, and he compares himself to a dyer who gets their own dye on their hands. This sullies him, and he's attempting to cure himself of it. The speaker is willing to take whatever medicine he needs to, no matter how bitter.

The poem takes the reader through a series of images that outline her other as the moon and her father as a yew tree. Neither of these forces did Plath any good in her life. The poet begins the poem by speaking about her mind and the coldness and darkness she can find within it. There is grief that is thrust upon her and no access to the world of warmth that should await her at home. When talking about her mother, the poet describes the moon. It has a “face in its own right” and no interest in providing Plath with a “door” to reach love, home, or happiness. The yew tree has a “Gothic shape” and is nothing more than “blackness and silence”. These are the two main images of her parents which are included alongside a cold and distant relationship with religion."
240,240,240,"If it form the one landscape that we, the inconstant ones,
Are consistently homesick for, this is chiefly
Because it dissolves in water. Mark these rounded slopes
With their surface fragrance of thyme and, beneath,
A secret system of caves and conduits; hear the springs
That spurt out everywhere with a chuckle,
Each filling a private pool for its fish and carving
Its own little ravine whose cliffs entertain
The butterfly and the lizard; examine this region
Of short distances and definite places:
What could be more like Mother or a fitter background
For her son, the flirtatious male who lounges
Against a rock in the sunlight, never doubting
That for all his faults he is loved; whose works are but
Extensions of his power to charm? From weathered outcrop
To hill-top temple, from appearing waters to
Conspicuous fountains, from a wild to a formal vineyard,
Are ingenious but short steps that a child's wish
To receive more attention than his brothers, whether
By pleasing or teasing, can easily take.
Watch, then, the band of rivals as they climb up and down
Their steep stone gennels in twos and threes, at times
Arm in arm, but never, thank God, in step; or engaged
On the shady side of a square at midday in
Voluble discourse, knowing each other too well to think
There are any important secrets, unable
To conceive a god whose temper-tantrums are moral
And not to be pacified by a clever line
Or a good lay: for accustomed to a stone that responds,
They have never had to veil their faces in awe
Of a crater whose blazing fury could not be fixed;
Adjusted to the local needs of valleys
Where everything can be touched or reached by walking,
Their eyes have never looked into infinite space
Through the lattice-work of a nomad's comb; born lucky,
Their legs have never encountered the fungi
And insects of the jungle, the monstrous forms and lives
With which we have nothing, we like to hope, in common.
So, when one of them goes to the bad, the way his mind works
Remains incomprehensible: to become a pimp
Or deal in fake jewellery or ruin a fine tenor voice
For effects that bring down the house, could happen to all
But the best and the worst of us…
That is why, I suppose,
The best and worst never stayed here long but sought
Immoderate soils where the beauty was not so external,
The light less public and the meaning of life
Something more than a mad camp. 'Come!' cried the granite wastes,
""How evasive is your humour, how accidental
Your kindest kiss, how permanent is death."" (Saints-to-be
Slipped away sighing.) ""Come!"" purred the clays and gravels,
""On our plains there is room for armies to drill; rivers
Wait to be tamed and slaves to construct you a tomb
In the grand manner: soft as the earth is mankind and both
Need to be altered."" (Intendant Caesars rose and
Left, slamming the door.) But the really reckless were fetched
By an older colder voice, the oceanic whisper:
""I am the solitude that asks and promises nothing;
That is how I shall set you free. There is no love;
There are only the various envies, all of them sad.""
They were right, my dear, all those voices were right
And still are; this land is not the sweet home that it looks,
Nor its peace the historical calm of a site
Where something was settled once and for all: A back ward
And dilapidated province, connected
To the big busy world by a tunnel, with a certain
Seedy appeal, is that all it is now? Not quite:
It has a worldy duty which in spite of itself
It does not neglect, but calls into question
All the Great Powers assume; it disturbs our rights. The poet,
Admired for his earnest habit of calling
The sun the sun, his mind Puzzle, is made uneasy
By these marble statues which so obviously doubt
His antimythological myth; and these gamins,
Pursuing the scientist down the tiled colonnade
With such lively offers, rebuke his concern for Nature's
Remotest aspects: I, too, am reproached, for what
And how much you know. Not to lose time, not to get caught,
Not to be left behind, not, please! to resemble
The beasts who repeat themselves, or a thing like water
Or stone whose conduct can be predicted, these
Are our common prayer, whose greatest comfort is music
Which can be made anywhere, is invisible,
And does not smell. In so far as we have to look forward
To death as a fact, no doubt we are right: But if
Sins can be forgiven, if bodies rise from the dead,
These modifications of matter into
Innocent athletes and gesticulating fountains,
Made solely for pleasure, make a further point:
The blessed will not care what angle they are regarded from,
Having nothing to hide. Dear, I know nothing of

It elaborates on the close existence of human life with nature. It explores human transformation with nature and vice versa. 'In Praise of Limestone' is a depiction of human growth and bond with limestone panorama. It specializes in a reasonable atmosphere for stability in this world. Auden explicitly presents the intense natures of human beings through the intense climates of the world. Through the images and metaphor, the poet correlates the inconsistency of limestone to the inconsistency of human. The limestone dissolves in water, for it has not a flexible nature, similarly, humans who are not flexible will be forgotten in history. The poet touches upon the humans being immortal, imperfect, and faithless to one another. The poet alludes to the statues and sculptures of humble saints and warriors/kings, who had a remarkable life. He concludes the poem with the note that one doesn't need to change places but they can adapt to the situation that prevails."
241,241,241,"The little river twittering in the twilight,
The wan, wondering look of the pale sky,
This is almost bliss.

All the troubles and anxieties and pain
Gone under the twilight.
Only the twilight now, and the soft “Sh!” of the river
That will last forever.
And at last I know my love for you is here,
I can see it all, it is whole like the twilight,
It is large, so large, I could not see it before
Because of the little lights and flickers and interruptions,
Troubles, anxieties, and pains.

You are the wish, and I the fulfillment,

Lawrence is a love poem in which the speaker considers the irritations and restrictions of the real world. The poet's speaker addresses the beautiful scene he's experiencing in the first lines of 'Bei Hennef.' He describes the twilight, the river, and how far away he feels from his every day worries. This is something that allows him to think clearly in a way he can't when he's going about his mundane routine. Now, he can look around him and at his love and know how pure and full it is. He loves the intended listener of this poem, “you,” fully and completely. He knows now that the two complete one another. Despite this, he concludes, they still suffer from the annoyances of reality, and their love isn't as strong as it could be on a day to day basis."

But, their focus on imagery suggests that they care about nature and respect the rural lifestyle, which becomes clearer as the poem progresses. In the next lines, the speaker introduces more human-related imagery. This includes examples of farm equipment, structures one might find on a farm, and other objects one could encounter there.

They peered from their windows and tried to look at the happenings outside. By drawing the shades, they watched through the charred glass. A group of men dressed in white costumes gathered around a cross trussed like a Christmas tree. They put it on fire and left the place. Those who were inside their houses (including the speaker and her family) watched the fiery show throughout the night, in the trembling light of a hurricane lamp."

And court the flower that cheapens his array.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he was once walking through the woods on a windy day in May. The weather was not great, and the woods through which he traveled were bleak. That is until came upon the “fresh Rhodora,” or rhododendron. The brightness of the petals this flower illuminated everything around it. The dark water was made gay and the birds put to shame for their lack of brilliance. In the second half, the speaker describes the power of simple beauty. As well as how the flower exists for no other reason than to be beautiful. One has eyes to gaze upon such things, but they do not grow for humankind."

Beginning with what is bad about the country, McKay quickly says that he loves it. The poet understands that it is a country that has a quality that inspires strength and passion, although there are certainly many bits that do the opposite. The poem is at once a critique and a love letter to the United States of America."

The majority of this piece is made up o statements about the state of the environment followed by three lines about the speaker's own experience. Winter is approaching throughout this piece. It never arrives, but is seen to kill the leaves, flowers, and dull down the colors of the world. While to many this would be a depressing sight, alongside the deaths of friends and the loss of love, the speaker is not changed by it. He is so deep into his own mental depression there is nothing that can pull him out of it. It gives him a backward kind of strength as well as there is no further down he can sink. He is at the bottom of every possible emotion. The poem concludes with his description of the “unhope” he is waiting in. There is no end in sight to his predicament, he is trapped.

'Night Sweat' by Robert Lowell is an emotionally complex poem. It's not clear why the speaker is suffering from night sweats. The metaphorical meaning of “my stalled equipment” makes it clear that the speaker is going through writer's block. The downward glide of his ability and his previous bias are blocking him to pen down that “one writing”. However, in the next section of the poem, the poet says his wife's presence lightens his mind. She has such a personality that even makes the plain things of his room cheerful. At last, he requests his dear wife to redeem him from his anguish and frustration as she has done before."

Songs, commands, health, pride, the maternal mystery, the seminal milk,
All hopes, benefactions, bestowals, all the passions, loves, beauties, delights of the earth,
All the governments, judges, gods, follow'd persons of the earth,
These are contain'd in sex as parts of itself and justifications of itself.

Without shame the man I like knows and avows the deliciousness of his sex,
Without shame the woman I like knows and avows hers.

I will go stay with her who waits for me, and with those women that are warm-blooded and sufficient for me,
I see that they understand me and do not deny me,
I see that they are worthy of me, I will be the robust husband of those women.

I dare not withdraw till I deposit what has so long accumulated within me.

In you I wrap a thousand onward years,
On you I graft the grafts of the best-beloved of me and America,
The drops I distil upon you shall grow fierce and athletic girls, new artists, musicians, and singers,
The babes I beget upon you are to beget babes in their turn,

I shall expect them to interpenetrate with others, as I and you interpenetrate now,

This Whitman poem is not merely about the act of procreation itself. Rather it is about the act of creation, particularly the way a perfect child is born, nurtured, and guided. The poem begins with a speaker describing how a perfect woman without lacking anything waits for him. Then he goes on to describe the act of sex and how it is all-inclusive. He particularly waits for the women who are passionate, “warm-blooded,” and “sufficient” for him. They are the ones who could bear the children of the future and nurture the qualities of the speaker within them. His creative energy is what he intends to plant in the hearts of the women who wait for none other than him."

And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lin’d,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well sav’d, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.","All the world’s a stage, And all the men and women merely players;","'All the world's a stage' is a monologue of “the melancholy Jaques” from Act II Scene VII of the play As You Like It by William Shakespeare. The speaker, Jacques, begins “All the world's a stage” by asserting that life is like a stage on which “men and women merely” play roles. They play different parts throughout their lives, as the speaker is now. In the bulk of this monologue, the speaker spends time going through the seven ages of man. One starts in infancy, moves through childhood, and into the best part of their life when they're a lover, soldier, and judge. Later, they lose control of their senses and eventually can't take care of themselves. You can read the full speech here with the analysis or watch Benedict Cumberbatch recite 'All the world's a stage'.

When a poem is able to make the natural world a character to root for or to dislike, it opens up countless dimensions of poetic intrigue that is unparalleled by most art. Stevie Smith’s ‘The River God’ gives away its main concept directly in the title — as a river cannot be a divine entity of any sort, the reader can expect the personification of the river into a godlike entity. For a poem to be able to create that analogy gives it a unique form and power, and Smith’s use of poetic devices to form her river character is done extremely well, for the creation of a poem just as powerful as its namesake."

The poem uses a snowy and rainy scene and the images of birds feeding to define the difference between “prose and poetry.” It is not a clear or obvious difference but one that requires some analysis to understand. This is part of the poet's way of suggesting how poems are different from prose work. They require more interpretation and may leave the reader without a clear understanding of what every image means.

This poem is told from the perspective of a second person narrator directing their statements at an undefined “you.” The poem begins by describing how the world will be the same after this person has passed on. There will still be “rose and rhododendron” (1) and the “sunny sound” (4) of bees will still “be heard from white syringas” (3). Additional creatures and plants will go on as they always have, as will the seasons. Time will not stop for the world. The only physical things that will be disturbed are the simple weeds on the gravesite and the land that this person's spirit will walk after death. The poem concludes by calling this passing a “great” one (21) and making clear that while the world is not physically changed, it will be essentially changed for the speaker. The spark of beauty and magic in “common water” (23) and “simple stone” (24) will leave along with “you”."

Days later, while vacuuming, the lyrics come without thinking.
Days later, I think I see my old lover in a café but don’t,
how pleasing
it was to think it was him, to finally sing that song.
This is the way of all amplitude: we need the brightness
to die some.
This is the way of love and music: it plays like a god and
then is done.

what’s gone?","I am trying to remember the lyrics of old songs I’ve forgotten, mostly I am trying","'Blues for Almost forgotten Music' by Roxanne Beth Johnson uses remembering music as a metaphor for looking back over parts of a relationship. For Johnson, a happy relationship is like a 'musical' or 'hymn', the music is harmonious and great. Yet, just like music, relationships can be forgotten and fade over time. Johnson uses this idea of 'forgotten music' to discuss past relationships, their passion never fading, only being thought of less and less."
261,261,261,"From Wynyard's Gap the livelong day,
The livelong day,
We beat afoot the northward way
We had travelled times before.
The sun-blaze burning on our backs,
Our shoulders sticking to our packs,
By fosseway1, fields, and turnpike tracks
We skirted sad Sedge-Moor.

Full twenty miles we jaunted on,
We jaunted on, —
My fancy-man2, and jeering John,
And Mother Lee, and I.
And, as the sun drew down to west,
We climbed the toilsome Polden crest,
And saw, of landskip3 sights the best,
The inn that beamed thereby.

Ay, side by side
Through the Great Forest, Blackmoor4 wide,
And where the Parret ran.
We'd faced the gusts on Mendip ridge,
Had crossed the Yeo unhelped by bridge,
Been stung by every Marshwood midge5,
I and my fancy-man.

Lone inns we loved, my man and I,
My man and I;
'King's Stag', 'Windwhistle' high and dry,
'The Horse' on Hintock Green,
The cosy house at Wynyard's Gap,
'The Hut', renowned on Bredy Knap,
And many another wayside tap
Where folk might sit unseen.

O deadly day,
O deadly day! —
I teased my fancy man in play
And wanton idleness.
I walked alongside jeering John,
I laid his hand my waist upon;
I would not bend my glances on
My lover's dark distress.

Thus Poldon top at last we won,
At last we won,
And gained the inn at sink of sun
Far-famed as 'Marshal's Elm'.
Beneath us figured tor and lea,6
From Mendip to the western sea —
I doubt if any finer sight there be
Within this royal realm.

Inside the settle7 all a-row —
All four a-row
We sat, I next to John, to show
That he had wooed and won.
And then he took me on his knee,
And swore it was his turn to be
My favoured mate, and Mother Lee
Passed to my former one.

Then in a voice I had never heard,
I had never heard,
My only love to me: 'One word,
My lady, if you please!
Whose is the child you are like8 to bear? —
His? After all my months o' care?'
Gods knows 'twas not! But, O despair!
I nodded — still to tease.

Then he sprung, and with his knife —
And with his knife,
He let out jeering Johnny's life,
Yes; there at set of sun.
The slant ray through the window nigh
Gilded John's blood and glazing eye,
Ere scarcely Mother Lee and I
Knew that the deed was done.

The taverns tell the gloomy tale,
The gloomy tale,
How that at Ivel-Chester jail
My love, my sweetheart swung;
Though stained till now by no misdeed
Save one horse ta'en in time of need;
(Blue Jimmy stole right many a steed
Ere his last fling he flung.)

Thereaft I walked the world alone
Alone, alone!
On his death-day I gave my groan
And dropt his dead-born child.
'Twas nigh the jail, beneath a tree,
None tending me; for Mother Lee
Had died at Glaston,9 leaving me
Unfriended on the wild.

And in the night as I lay weak,
As I lay weak,
The leaves a-falling on my cheek,
The red moon low declined —
The ghost of him I'd die to kiss
Rose up and said: 'Ah, tell me this!
Was the child mine, or was it his?
Speak, that I my rest may find!'

O doubt but I told him then,
I told him then,
That I had kept me from all men
Since we joined lips and swore.
Whereat he smiled, and thinned away
As the wind stirred to call up day . . .

Haunting the Western Moor.",The taverns tell the gloomy tale of a young man,"'A Trampwoman's Tragedy' by Thomas Hardy is a narrative poem that speaks on a number of avoidable deaths brought on by thoughtless teasing. The poem begins with the speaker describing a journey across England. She and three companions were walking through forests, over hills, and thoroughly enjoying the trip. It was a long and hard one, but they had one another. The most important relationship within the group is that between the speaker, the trampwoman, and her lover. These two had been together for a long time and the speaker decided to tease her lover. She did so by pretending that another traveler, Jeering John, had won her over. This progressed until her lover became enraged, demanded to know if she was carrying his child, and murdered Jeering John. His act of violence, and the speaker's acts of thoughtlessness, led to his death by hanging. The speaker miscarried her child and was left alone to wander the landscape. The only moment of peace comes when the ghost of the lover comes to her and finally receives the correct answer to his question. Yes, the baby was his. This allows him to depart to the next life."

And there's a barrel that I didn't fill
Beside it, and there may be two or three
Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.

Essence of winter sleep is on the night,
The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.
I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight

I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough
And held against the world of hoary grass.
It melted, and I let it fall and break.
But I was well
Upon my way to sleep before it fell,
And I could tell
What form my dreaming was about to take.
Magnified apples appear and disappear,
Stem end and blossom end,
And every fleck of russet showing clear.
My instep arch not only keeps the ache,
It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.
I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.
And I keep hearing from the cellar bin
The rumbling sound
Of load on load of apples coming in.
For I have had too much
Of apple-picking: I am overtired
Of the great harvest I myself desired.
There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,
Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall.
For all
That struck the earth,
No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,
Went surely to the cider-apple heap
As of no worth.
One can see what will trouble
This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.

The woodchuck could say whether it's like his
Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,
Or just some human sleep.","The smell of apples is on the night, The scent of apples: I am drow","‘After Apple-Picking’ by Robert Frost begins with an apple-picker’s thoughts after a day of work. The poem goes on to explore themes of life and death. Having picked apples throughout the day, he is tired now. His day’s work is over, but the task of apple-picking is not yet complete. The speaker tells that his long ladder still stands ‘sticking through a tree’, rising high toward heaven. He seems to have left it there on purpose to do some more apple-picking later."

The poem takes the reader into a speaker's memory. He recalls being in a liquorice, or “licorice,” field. There, he saw a woman who filled him with an immediate passion. The poem takes its time describing how she captured him with her eyes and red hair. There are also fulsome descriptions of the town and an only slightly misdescribed image of liquorice blooms."

Throughout the lines of this piece, Montgomery's speaker describes a forest and the sights and sounds within it. Rather than directly depicting them, though, she uses Greek mythology to make the forest feel even more magical and otherworldly than it already does. This allows her to allude to Pan, dryads, gnomes, and more."

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins by describing how devoted he is to God and describing how he feels that God made him in his image. The speaker is dedicated to God, but he's lived a sinful life. This is something he's well aware of and which he's trying to atone for. But, he worries that he doesn't have enough time to escape Satan's grasp."

He communicates a feeling that is all too familiar for many people. He is confused about the feeling he is experiencing- so confused, in fact, that he doesn’t know whether it is love or hate. The feeling that Thoreau relates to this poem is one that most have felt when they have experienced the breaking off of a relationship. Thoreau expresses these feelings so articulately that readers can easily conclude the cause of this feeling."

The poem draws images of nature, showing how language and words can be controlled and placed in an organized manner. Riprap is often used as a foundation for a breakwater or other structures, which is why Snyder compares it to words, which form the foundation of human language, expressions, and eventually, of society."

A lecture, love, in love's philosophy.
These three hours that we have spent,
Walking here, two shadows went
Along with us, which we ourselves produc'd.
But, now the sun is just above our head,
We do those shadows tread,
And to brave clearness all things are reduc'd.
So whilst our infant loves did grow,
Disguises did, and shadows, flow
From us, and our cares; but now 'tis not so.
That love has not attain'd the high'st degree,
Which is still diligent lest others see.
Except our loves at this noon stay,
We shall new shadows make the other way.
As the first were made to blind
Others, these which come behind
Will work upon ourselves, and blind our eyes.
If our loves faint, and westwardly decline,
To me thou, falsely, thine,
And I to thee mine actions shall disguise.
The morning shadows wear away,
But these grow longer all the day;
But oh, love's day is short, if love decay.
Love is a growing, or full constant light,
And his first minute, after noon, is night.","A lecture, love, in love's philosophy. These three hours that we have spent,","This poem is part of Songs and Sonnets, a collection of poems published two years after John Donne’s death. Songs and Sonnets includes 55 poems, which are not strictly “songs” or “sonnets”, that were not conceived as a compilation including ‘A Lecture upon the Shadow.’ They were written between 1590 and 1617 and later edited and grouped in different editions of Donne’s Poems. Consequently, the poems are all part of a love lyric but don’t always portray a single approach to love. Songs and Sonnets also includes poems like The Flea, The Good Morrow, and The Sun Rising, among others.

The poem narrates how a relationship that appeared to be blossoming has later deteriorated. Thus, love is one of the main themes of A Lecture upon the Shadow. John Donne is known for portraying intense emotions through conceits. A conceit is a metaphor that compares two dissimilar things in an unusual way. Particularly, in A Lecture upon the Shadow, the lyrical voice compares the different stages of a relationship to the course of a day and the movement of the sun.

A Lecture upon the Shadow follows the sonnet form loosely. The traditional sonnet is formed by an octave and a sestet with an ABBAABBA CDDCEE (or CDCDEE) rhyme scheme. The Shakespearean sonnet, which is contemporary to Donne’s poetry, is formed by three quatrains and a couplet in iambic pentameter with ABAB CDCD EFEF GG rhyme. A Lecture upon the Shadow has 26 lines in iambic pentameter with an AABBCDDCEEE rhyme scheme. The varying couplets and their rhyme resemble those of Shakespeare’s poetry. Moreover, the poem uses a great number of poetic devices such as alliteration, assonance, and extended metaphors."

The bulk of 'High Flight' is spent depicting, through techniques such as alliteration, sibilance, and personification, the experience of flying. The speaker's descriptions are joyous and upliftings. He describes the sensations of being separated from the earth and in parts of the sky even birds don't enter into. The experience is all in all, a spiritual one that brings him closer to God."

The narrative zooms out, taking the reader across the countryside and then to all of England.

Levertov's speaker talks about how he came across a swan's frozen body in the snow. The “barrel-sized” body of the creature easily captured his attention. He went near it to have a closer look. The scene made him feel sad for the creature. At the same time, it somehow aroused a sensation of awe in his heart. There was a resemblance between the frozen body and the untrodden snow near the shore. With close attention, he could notice its physical features clearly. In contrast to the stillness of the creature, nature went on at its own pace."

The boy has suffered a loss, one which does not become clear until the final line of the poem. He travels home and is met by his suffering family. His father is crying, and his mother is unable to even speak. There are many strangers around attempting to sympathize with the family, but their efforts appear awkward and are often unwanted. The body arrives via ambulance the next day and the boy takes a look at it when he is alone one morning. There are no great injuries that he can see but he knows this is due to the fact that this person was thrown by the bumper of a car. The final line states that the coffin will only be four feet long, the same length as the child's age, making clear to the reader that the speaker has lost his young brother in a terrible accident."

We search for a sign.",The fireworks are a riot of fire and a riot of fire and fire an,"Language and Imagery When it comes to the use of language and imagery, there are several types of images and vocabulary that the poet uses to describe the human feelings. Reading through the poem, you will come across images connected with fireworks, such as: “shapes”, “stars”, “diamonds”, and “rockets”. In addition, the poet also uses enjambment so that a quick pace and fast rhythm can be created in the poem. The poet makes use of this poetic device taking into account the theme of fireworks and its deeper meaning of euphoria and temporary excitement and. Moreover, the poet has cleverly used the word “falling” at the end of the fifth and second last lines, “of fire” and “stars”. The use of both these words in the poem indicates the physical act of falling. In fact, they are paradoxical, as fire and stars usually don't come down rather by nature they rise. Thus, all through the poem, you will poet making very clever use of language techniques to take ahead its theme."

Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong,
The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,
The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work,
The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand singing on the steamboat deck,
The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as he stands,
The wood-cutter’s song, the ploughboy’s on his way in the morning, or at noon intermission or at sundown,
The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work, or of the girl sewing or washing,
Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,
The day what belongs to the day—at night the party of young fellows, robust, friendly,
Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.","I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear, Those of mechanics,","Poetic Form Walt Whitman was an experimental poet, toying with forms of poetry. He is also known as the father of free verse poetry. He deemed himself above rigors of rhyme and meter since Whitman used free verses freely. However, his poetry is not a bunch of non-rhyming lines as 'I Hear America Singing' is a decent, tightly moderated poem. The poem is a listing of manual workers, their work content, and singing along the way. The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beamThe mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off workThe boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deck-hand singing on the steamboat deck As is the case, Walt Whitman's poems tend to get lengthy as they progress, whereas they are tightly managed in the beginning. This phenomenon is called anaphora as repetition keeps recurring. It is the polar opposite of traditional poetry norms where verses are controlled tightly in order to maintain the rhyming sequence. In the case of Walt Whitman, he aspired to seek freedom of self-exploration and discovery, rising above conventional forms like a true American."

From livid curtain’s hue, a tangram emerges: a country.”
Meanwhile the Sea Hag was relaxing on a green couch: “How pleasant To spend one’s vacation en la casa de Popeye,” she scratched
Her cleft chin’s solitary hair. She remembered spinach
And was going to ask Wimpy if he had bought any spinach. “M’love,” he intercepted, “the plains are decked out in thunder Today, and it shall be as you wish.” He scratched
The part of his head under his hat. The apartment
Seemed to grow smaller. “But what if no pleasant

Suddenly they remembered how it was cheaper in the country. Wimpy was thoughtfully cutting open a number 2 can of spinach When the door opened and Swee’pea crept in. “How pleasant!”
But Swee’pea looked morose. A note was pinned to his bib. “Thunder And tears are unavailing,” it read. “Henceforth shall Popeye’s apartment Be but remembered space, toxic or salubrious, whole or scratched.”
Olive came hurtling through the window; its geraniums scratched
Her long thigh. “I have news!” she gasped. “Popeye, forced as you know to flee the country

“But you can’t do that—he hasn’t even finished his spinach,” Urged the Sea Hag, looking fearfully around at the apartment.
But Olive was already out of earshot. Now the apartment

From that shoebox of an apartment","'Farm Implements and Rutabagas in a Landscape' by John Ashbery is an unusual poem that uses the cartoon characters from Popeye to speak about American, middle-class dissatisfaction. The poem is a strange one. It follows a few moments in the lives of recognizable characters from the Popeye cartoon included Olive, Sea Hag, Whimpy, and Swee'pea. The characters are staying in Popeye's apartment and go through emotional ups and downs. At one point, they feel like they're on a vacation, and in the next, they're irritated with the city and want to go to the country. When Olive comes into the poem and declares that Popeye has been exiled to the country and also describes his ability to control lightning, the poem gets more complex. In the end, after going back and forth in regards to how happy or unhappy they are, Popeye sends thunder into the apartment that's “domestic” and green like spinach."

For once, early in the cold new year,
We stopped, and, watching men with number plates
Sprint down the platform to familiar gates,
""Why, Coventry!"" I exclaimed. ""I was born here.""

I leant far out, and squinnied for a sign
That this was still the town that had been 'mine'
So long, but found I wasn't even clear
Which side was which. From where those cycle-crates
Were standing, had we annually departed

For all those family hols? . . . A whistle went:
Things moved. I sat back, staring at my boots.
'Was that,' my friend smiled, 'where you ""have your roots""?'
No, only where my childhood was unspent,
I wanted to retort, just where I started:

By now I've got the whole place clearly charted.
Our garden, first: where I did not invent
Blinding theologies of flowers and fruits,
And wasn't spoken to by an old hat.
And here we have that splendid family

I never ran to when I got depressed,
The boys all biceps and the girls all chest,
Their comic Ford, their farm where I could be
'Really myself'. I'll show you, come to that,
The bracken where I never trembling sat,

Determined to go through with it; where she
Lay back, and 'all became a burning mist'.
And, in those offices, my doggerel
Was not set up in blunt ten-point, nor read
By a distinguished cousin of the mayor,

Who didn't call and tell my father There
Before us, had we the gift to see ahead -
'You look as though you wished the place in Hell,'
My friend said, 'judging from your face.' 'Oh well,
I suppose it's not the place's fault,' I said.

'Nothing, like something, happens anywhere.","Coventry is a town that has been a mine for generations, and the place","I Remember, I Remember' by Philip Larkin contains the passing thoughts of a speaker as he sees his hometown of Coventry from a train. The poem begins with the speaker and his friend arriving, briefly, in Coventry. They are on their way somewhere else and are stopped at the platform. The speaker looks around, hoping to see something he recognizes, but doesn't. This fact does not surprise him as Coventry was never really a home to him. The rest of the poem is devoted to describing things that didn't happen to the speaker. He has in his mind an idealized version of what childhood should be. He also knows his childhood did not match up with his own experience. The speaker did not have close family friends, spend happy hours in the garden, or have his written work recognized by someone of marginal importance. These factors add up to an unhappy childhood that the speaker's friend questions him about. The poem concludes with the speaker saying it wasn't Coventry's fault he was unhappy as he would've been unhappy anywhere."

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker describes the transition from spring to summer through the sun's increased heat. This comes down to the earth and the soil and makes the daffodil bloom. This is encouraged further by some rainstorms. When the daffodil does bloom, it is gold like the sun and standing erect through the season. There's nothing that can diminish its beauty."

The speaker of the poem spends these seven stanzas chastising the women for their selfishness and inability to care about the entire world. They cannot see outside of their own home. She calls upon their motherhood to spread to those that are desperate for food and a mother's love. To the Indifferent Women concludes with the statement that if men and women could come together and share their love with the whole world, all homes would be happy. She is promoting the idea that we must allow ourselves to look out from our own worlds and into those that are uncomfortable and even miserable. If we do not allow ourselves to see the world in its entirety, we may not be able to hold onto the happiness that we have created for ourselves. Those that are lucky, must help those that are not."

The poem takes the reader through metaphorical comparisons between oxen, water buffalo, and seals. Each has their own skill and confidence in their individual environments. The speaker says she is interested in people who embody these same traits. She goes on, referencing the pleasures and payoffs of hard work and connecting them to a Hopi vase and Greek amphora. Just as these creations cry out for work, so too do human beings."

In the first lines, the poet draws attention to the significance of paper in various contexts. The back pages of a well-used book or the pages of the Koran, where names and histories are recorded, represent the accumulation of human stories and experiences. The poet highlights the nature of buildings by suggesting that if they were made of paper, they would easily crumble and disappear with a sigh or a shift of wind. The poem also suggests that an architect could utilize the transformative power of paper and light, creating layers of meaning and beauty in a structure. Rather than relying on durable materials like brick or block, the poet envisions a structure made of paper, representing the fragile nature of existence."

In the first lines of 'Eating Together,' the speaker begins by describing what his family is going to have to eat. These lines are a stark contrast with the final four, in which the poet is far more lyrical and emotional. Between these sections, the speaker notes that he's there with his mother, brothers, and sister. Together, they're sitting down for a meal that includes trout, ginger, and more. His mother has a new role at the table, he says. She tastes the “sweetest meat of the head,” as his father used to do. With this line, it becomes clear that the family has suffered a loss. The final four lines, or quatrain, describe the father through a simile. He's compared to a snow-covered road that has no travelers and is lonely for none. He went to sleep, likely a euphemism for dying, and now the family dynamic has changed. But, they are still together, and life goes on."

Down with snaky silver glitter.

Spinning love and night and madness,
Madness of the spring at sea.

And lavished vermilion kisses

The poem begins with the narrator looking out at the Seine River and describing the conflict he feels as it “swirl[s] away.” He describes it as being both “dark” and as “Laughing,” setting up the backdrop for the tumult of emotions that he will expound on. In an attempt to escape from the powerful emotions that hearing and seeing the river unearth, the speaker flees into his home. Bolting the door behind him, he ascends to his room where he hopes to find silence. Instead, an open window lets the sounds of the river into his room. It is at this point in the poem that the reader will come to understand that the narrator has lost a love of the utmost importance to him. He feels this loss intensely and is further reminded of it on the bank of the river. Additionally, as he looks below him to the street, it seems as if every passerby is in possession of a lilac flower (symbolizing love and youthful innocence, two things he has lost). The smell of the flowers has a similar impact on the speaker as the sound of the river. The poem concludes with the narrator relating his loss of love to the formation and dissipation of the smell of flowers and the rapidly running river. "

The poem begins with the speaker describing how he is made up of a number of different animals. They are so integral to his being it is like they are inside him. He begins by speaking about the “blood-red” wolf who gives him undeniable strength. He then moves onto the “silver-grey fox” who is both cunning and vicious. The next stanzas speak of his ability to keep a “hog” and an extremely unattractive baboon inside of him. These creatures are not obvious in their benefits but the speaker makes clear why they matter to him. The final animals are the most interesting. He contains the first fish-like creature to ever walk on the planet, a sign of his spiritually important pedigree. Lastly, he has a dichotomy of birds. The final section speaks on the narrator's dedication to maintaining his interior zoo as well as all that which makes him a lover, mother and father. He is a part of the world and will take care of all that which he contributes to it."

This piece reflects a story of a woman whose lengthy relationship has exposed her own vices as well as her partner's for too long of a time. Because of this, she frees herself of her significant other and goes on a journey for freedom. During this poem, one is reminded of the beauties of being alone. The author reaffirms her need for solidarity in the final stanza. Without hesitation, the speaker goes full force into a life of new meaning. She undergoes a process of finding herself again. As her mind is freed, she is able to become in tune with the needs and happenings that are present in the world."

Enraged, we wanted revenge
and then, Chiwoniso, you stepped on the stage and
you opened your mouth and
every stolen river of platinum and gold
poured out of your mouth in song;
your voice etched us out of the night
and doubled the light in each of us.
You restored all the treasure-houses
from Benin to Zimbabwe, Mapungubwe to Cairo;
Africa moved its golden bones,
shook off its heavy chains
and danced again.
That night I thought
if only
love could purchase bread,
Africans would not be hungry.",We Africans came to Berlin to sing and recite poetry. We had an agenda:,"Stolen Rivers Analysis The very first line of the poem, which can be read in full here, and the use of first-person “We” themselves suggest that the poet and to whom (Chiwoniso) this poem is dedicated both came to Berlin from Africa to do their jobs like singing songs and reciting poetry. The “We” also represents the whole African community, who shift to different parts of the world to earn their livelihood. Since, with “We” she is representing the whole community of Africans; this first-person pronoun can be understood as a representative of all those Africans who live in different parts of the world. The poet further says that they both had the same agenda, that is; singing and reciting poems. But how can they both forget their anthems of loss, like galloping, consuming, the pillage, the cries, like forest fires, like haunted children that they had to face due to racism, how can they forget the loss they had to bear due to racism, and how can they redress the loss caused by this apartheid—a system of segregation or discrimination on the grounds of race in South Africa. In further lines, when the poet says: “Enraged, we wanted revenge”, it means that not only they both (Chiwoniso and Phillippa Yaa De Villiers) were enraged at what they had to face for being black in colour, but they too experienced a great loss of their properties and personal belongings. However, when, the poet says, Chiwoniso stepped on the stage and opened her mouth that is; started singing beautiful songs with great and revolutionary lyrics, the people of Africa were highly impressed and inspired. Every stolen river of platinum and gold poured out of your mouth in song was like an inspiring and revolutionary message for all Africans living in different parts of the world. The poet says that your voice (Chiwoniso's voice) not only brought them out of the night or the darkness of discrimination and racism, but it also doubled the light in each of them, that is, all the Africans became more enlightened and aware of their rights. The poet says that from Benin to Zimbabwe, Mapungubwe to Cairo all got mesmerized, enthralled, and impressed by Chiwoniso's singing, they were restored with all the treasure-houses. With the presence of Chiwoniso, Africa not only moved its golden bones, but it also broke free from its heavy chains or shackles of racism. As Chiwoniso came into their lives with her singing, Africa also started dancing again. The last lines of the poem are very poignant, and they really touch hearts when the poet says: “love could purchase bread, Africans would not be hungry,” which shows that on the night when the poet was writing this poem, she was very sad, and feeling dejected to the rampant racism, remembering the past loss she had to bear. Through the last two lines, the poet also gives the message, by saying if the whites had love, respect in their hearts, and had not discriminated against them on the basis of their colours, neither the Africans had to stay hungry, nor they had to experience the loss, caused by racial discrimination. That night could either be the night when the poet wrote this poem, or this night could also be the night when the great soul of Africa, Chiwoniso Maraire died. Thus, the poem, Stolen River, is a masterpiece by Phillippa Yaa De Villiers, who was a well-known writer at her own age."

I was a child and she was a child,
In this kingdom by the sea,
But we loved with a love that was more than love—
I and my Annabel Lee—
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven
Coveted her and me.
And this was the reason that, long ago,
In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee;
So that her highborn kinsmen came
And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulchre
In this kingdom by the sea.
The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
Went envying her and me—
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,
In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we—
Of many far wiser than we—
And neither the angels in Heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,
In her sepulchre there by the sea—
In her tomb by the sounding sea.","I was a child and she was a child, In this kingdom by the sea,","Edgar Allan Poe writes Annabel Lee in the most unique tone, as was one of trademarks. When the poem begins, it sounds like a fairy tale and gives the reader a feeling of all that is good and happy. But underneath this joyful tone is a tone more ominous, and Poe uses certain words and phrases that give this eerie feeling. Partway through the poem, the readers begin to understand that this is not a common fairy tale. Rather, this is a dark and terrifying story. The tones and rhythms Poe use create an almost hypnotic effect.

The poem reads like a nursery rhyme in the way that it sounds, allowing the readers to venture back into childhood days in order to relate with the speaker. However, the content of the poem is not suitable for children, and so the contrast between the rhyme and rhythm of the poem and the content leaves the reader feeling deeply moved. This is a skill Poe used in many of his works. His tone is entirely unique. He has a way of grasping the readers’ attention and pulling them into his work before he reveals the truly dark and sometimes cynical nature of the content."

In 'Homework' by Allen Ginsberg, the speaker feels as if the dirty places are clothes. He tries to wash them clean and remove the dirt of environmental degradation, politics, and pollution. There is a reference to a variety of countries, rivers, and places in this poem. The poet refers to countries such as Iran, the United States, Alaska, Russia, and China. Moreover, the poet refers to continents such as Africa, Asia, and North America. He also talks about the rivers namely Amazon, Rhine, Hudson, Thames, and Neckar, and other water bodies such as Carin and Gulf of Mexico, Love Canal, Mediterranean basin, and Lake Eerie. Apart from that, there are other references in the poem such as the North Pole, Rocky Flats, Los Alamos, Parthenon, and Sphinx. By pointing out these places, Ginsberg highlights the major causes of natural degradation in the mentioned places. Last but not least, he wants to purify them by symbolically washing, scrubbing, wiping, rubbing, rinsing, and wringing those places."

The speaker spends the three stanzas of this free verse poem addressing the impact that the “planners” have on the world around him and others. He suggests that the constant desire to build a new, better city is detrimental to one's understanding of the past. At the end of the poem, the speaker discusses how as a poet, the new world that's been created around him is entirely uninspiring. His poet's heart is not going to bleed for these sites, sounds, and lack of history that surrounds him (or that he believes is going to surround him as things change in the future)."

In the first part of this poem, the speaker, someone outside the Aboriginal Australian community, describes a small group, all the remains of a specific tribe, coming into town. They come to the place of their “old bora ground” and appear like strangers amongst the changes that the “many white men” have made. The poem transitions into the perspective of the small group, utilizing the word “We” at the beginning of successive lines. The group of Aboriginal Australians highlights the importance of the land, their culture, and their past. They allude to all that's been lost and the remaining strength of their community. As the poem concludes, the group of speakers also describe how British colonialism has affected the land itself and the animals that used to reside there. The poem ends with the haunting line “We are going” suggesting that soon, all remaining members of this tribe, and tribes across Australia, will be lost."

In the first lines of 'XII: An Epitaph,' the speaker talks to the listener, a visitor or passerby of some kind. This person, he says, is welcome to stay but probably shouldn't because the night is on the way. Night, it soon becomes clear, is a metaphor for death, something that's coming to claim the speaker. The speaker spends the remaining lines of the poem describing death as something he's welcoming. He doesn't mind that it's coming for him as it'll be a welcome relief to the ancient evil that has been tormenting him."

But, outside their homes, the wind—a skilled and powerful craftsman— was working on his structures. When the sun finally came up the next morning the speaker took note of everything that had been created overnight.

And so it was for the tenor Caruso.
He couldn’t sleep—you know how the ovation Rings in your ears, and you re-sing your part.
And then the ceiling trembled
And the floor moved. He ran into the street. Never had Naples given him such a reception!
The air was darker than Vesuvius. “O mamma mia,”
He cried, “I’ve lost my voice!”
At that moment the hideous voice of Culture, Hysterical woman, thrashing her arms and legs, Shrieked from the ruins.
At that moment everyone became a performer. Otello and Don Giovanni And Figaro strode on the midmost stage.
In the high window of a burning castle Lucia raved. Black horses
Plunged through fire, dragging the wild bells.
The curtains were wrapped in smoke. Tin swords Were melting; masks and ruffs
Burned—and the costumes of the peasants’ chorus.
Night fell. The white moon rose And sank in the Pacific. The tremors Passed under the waves. And Death rested.

Watching the silent, bowler-hatted man,
The engineer, who writes in the smoking field;
Now as he hands the paper to a boy,
Who takes it and runs to a group of waiting men, And they disperse and move toward their wagons,
Mules bray and the wagons move—
Wait! Before you start
(Already the wheels are rattling on the stones)
Say, did your fathers cross the dry Sierras To build another London?
Do Americans always have to be second-rate?
Wait! For there are spirits
In the earth itself, or the air, or sea. Where are the aboriginal American devils?
Cloud shadows, pine shadows
Falling across the bright Pacific bay ... (Already they have nailed rough boards together)
Wait only for the wind
That rustles in the eucalyptus tree. Wait only for the light
That trembles on the petals of a rose.
(The mortar sets—banks are the first to stand) Wait for a rose, and you may wait forever.

We taste our wine, looking at the Pacific. How sad it is, the end of America!
While we were waiting for the land They’d finished it—with gas drums
On the hilltops, cheap housing in the valleys
Where lives are mean and wretched. But the banks thrive and the realtors Rejoice—they have their America.
Still, there is something unsettled in the air. Out there on the Pacific There’s no America but the Marines.

But right about himself. The land is within.

In the first section, the poet refers to the opera singers who once mesmerized the people with their unique voices. Thereafter, in the next section of the poem, the poet describes how the brick-and-mortar dots the city. The city lacks the free lands where once poets like Simpson, Walt Whitman wandered and composed poems. In the last section of the poem, Simpson presents dark imagery. Here, the speaker laments the loss of innocence for the rise of harsh modernity."

The speaker of this piece imagines himself on his boat sailing across the scenic Cayuga Lake. He prefers sailing on the lake rather than driving on the road. His attitude towards cars seems dismissive as he calls the people who use them “modern creep[s].” They are always in a hurry and keep honking. It annoys the speaker the most, and it gets reflected in the poem's tone. Besides, the speaker is free-spirited and prefers the openness of the lake rather than the hustle and bustle of the roads. In totality, this poem speaks about the speaker's preferences in life."

Hosts to species long since departed,
Marked the mastodon,
The dinosaur, who left dried tokens
Of their sojourn here
On our planet floor,
Any broad alarm of their hastening doom
Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages.

But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully,
Come, you may stand upon my
Back and face your distant destiny,
But seek no haven in my shadow.
I will give you no hiding place down here.

You, created only a little lower than
The angels, have crouched too long in
The bruising darkness
Have lain too long
Face down in ignorance.
Your mouths spilling words

Armed for slaughter.
The Rock cries out to us today, you may stand upon me,
But do not hide your face.

Across the wall of the world,
A River sings a beautiful song. It says,
Come, rest here by my side.

Each of you, a bordered country,
Delicate and strangely made proud,
Yet thrusting perpetually under siege.
Your armed struggles for profit
Have left collars of waste upon
My shore, currents of debris upon my breast.
Yet today I call you to my riverside,
If you will study war no more. Come,
Clad in peace, and I will sing the songs
The Creator gave to me when I and the
Tree and the rock were one.
Before cynicism was a bloody sear across your
Brow and when you yet knew you still
Knew nothing.

The Gay, the Straight, the Preacher,

They hear. They all hear
The speaking of the Tree.

They hear the first and last of every Tree
Speak to humankind today. Come to me, here beside the River.
Plant yourself beside the River.

Each of you, descendant of some passed
On traveller, has been paid for.
You, who gave me my first name, you,
Pawnee, Apache, Seneca, you
Cherokee Nation, who rested with me, then
Forced on bloody feet,
Left me to the employment of
Other seekers—desperate for gain,
Starving for gold.
You, the Turk, the Arab, the Swede, the German, the Eskimo, the Scot,
You the Ashanti, the Yoruba, the Kru, bought,
Sold, stolen, arriving on the nightmare
Praying for a dream.
Here, root yourselves beside me.
I am that Tree planted by the River,
Which will not be moved.
I, the Rock, I the River, I the Tree
I am yours—your passages have been paid.
Lift up your faces, you have a piercing need
For this bright morning dawning for you.
History, despite its wrenching pain
Cannot be unlived, but if faced
With courage, need not be lived again.

Lift up your eyes upon
This day breaking for you.
Give birth again
To the dream.

Women, children, men,
Take it into the palms of your hands,
Mold it into the shape of your most
Private need. Sculpt it into
The image of your most public self.
Lift up your hearts

For a new beginning.
Do not be wedded forever
To fear, yoked eternally
To brutishness.

Offering you space to place new steps of change.

No less to you now than the mastodon then.

This poem begins with a short depiction of the lost era when ancient creatures existed. However, with time, they lost. Now, the speaker says even nature, being the essence of life, is now on the verge of extinction. Therefore, the speaker of this poem urges everyone to join hands and cherish a better future not only for Americans but for the whole world. She hints at the voices of the rock, river, and tree to draw home the fact that nature is not kind anymore. Nature has changed a little, she is firm now, but her softness still exists. Therefore, humans have to take a pledge of saving nature as well as for the betterment of humankind."

Thereafter, she held it with her hands carefully. Now, while she holds the creature in her hand, she can observe its marvelous beauty closely.

The man was kneeling down next to a duck he shot and speaking to it. Through Audubon's words, the speaker explains why the duck was shot and what Audubon hoped would come of the death.

The stanzas of this poem are fairly straightforward as the speaker walks the reader through the moments surrounding his encounter with a specific woman. He met her in Burma, and now after he's left, he's longing for her. The soldier describes his distaste for London and the simple fact that he'd like to be somewhere else, somewhere unfamiliar and exotic. Throughout the poem, Kipling makes references to people and places as well as customs in Burma that his speaker familiarized himself with. This helps create a very specific atmosphere for his memories and allows them to contrast well against the soldier's present home."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that animals live in a world that does not feel the touch of time. They are elevated above humanity and remembered as they were before God made humankind. Additionally, he makes it clear that they have a weakness. They are unable to speak for themselves. This factor has made their lives more tenuous. In the following stanzas, the speaker describes the creation of the world. He is recalling or imagining the day on which all manner of elements existed and animals were created. It was here, before humans were made, that there was peace. Animals moved freely, without restraint throughout the world. Although one cannot return to this time, it is possible to imagine. "

From the moment
I started rolling my dad’s tube socks
And shooting imaginary
Game-winning shots
In the Great Western Forum
I knew one thing was real:
I fell in love with you.
A love so deep I gave you my all
From my mind & body
To my spirit & soul.
As a six-year-old boy
Deeply in love with you
I never saw the end of the tunnel.
I only saw myself
Running out of one.
And so I ran.

After every loose ball for you.

I gave you my heart
Because it came with so much more.
I played through the sweat and hurt
Not because challenge called me
But because YOU called me.
I did everything for YOUBecause that’s what you do
When someone makes you feel as
Alive as you’ve made me feel.
You gave a six-year-old boy his Laker dream
And I’ll always love you for it.
But I can’t love you obsessively for much longer.
This season is all I have left to give.
My heart can take the pounding
My mind can handle the grind
But my body knows it’s time to say goodbye.
And that’s OK.
I’m ready to let you go.
I want you to know now
So we both can savor every moment we have left together.
The good and the bad.
We have given each other
All that we have.
And we both know, no matter what I do next
I’ll always be that kid
With the rolled up socks
Garbage can in the corner

The letter, which is in the form of a poem, separated into stanzas, takes the reader through Bryant's emotional connection to the game.

It enters through the thickness of the laburnum leaves to its nest. And, the tree awakes from its slumber and enjoys the “chitterings”, “tremor of wings”, and “trillings” of the birds. It seems like the tree is trembling and thrilled by their presence. But, when the mother goldfinch launches herself away from the branches to the sky, the tree again comes to its previous state."

However, Sassoon details the truth in the voice of a man, then a grandfather, who speaks plainly about the truth of the war."

He does not yet know whether a solemn or joyous song will be sung. The speaker takes the reader to the side of the body. There, many are gathered. They mourn over her departure, crying and weeping unnecessarily. He believes that their actions dishonor her. They should not mourn but celebrate. In contrast, the mourners do not believe that the speaker should sing the songs he is singing. His voice is weak and they wish him to sing something sadder. He refuses, hits the coffin, and uses the reverberations as a part of his song. When he addresses the dead woman, who the reader learns is his wife, he tells her that while she may be dead her spirit lives on. Her love touched everything around her, so he will not mourn. He will sing a “pæan” to celebrate her life rather than a “requiem” to mourn it."

She asks the question, are the happy moments of a relationship worth the sadness that comes after it ends? The title balances this idea, with the ‘omen’ of a broken future mirrored by the ‘hope’ that it can continue forever. The poem is beautiful to read, filled with imagery and complex ideas of love and heartbreak. Klink talks about love as if it were something that fills the body up, and something that can just as easily leave someone hollow. Yet, for Klink, these moments of heartbreak are justified by ‘all the stars’ that populate the relationship with beautiful memories, ones that last forever."

Longfellow wrote the piece about a father who had lost his son, in a way that only a father could and informs his story with a powerful and biblical source. In The Chamber Over the Gate, Longfellow focuses on the grief David feels for Absalom, and the way that grief resounds throughout Jerusalem. The biblical account that informs the poem, however, tells the story of a son who fought against his father in every way, by slaying another of his sons, and by usurping his throne. And yet, at the end of it all, David feels nothing but remorse and grief for his fallen son, and never stops being the man’s father, even in the wake of his betrayals. This incredible love that a father can feel for his son is at the heart of Longfellow’s work, and the message resounds as surely as David’s grief did throughout the city of Jerusalem."

The first half of this piece is a worshipful description by a son of his father, as he remembers how he looked and acted as he plowed their fields. The father is described as being powerful, strong beyond measure, and in total control of his “team.” The furrows he plows are pristine, and the son follows clumsily behind, unable to emulate his father's strength. In the very last stanza of the poem the roles are reversed and the speaker is now the strong one with his father depending on him and following him as he plows."

Eventually, the second speaker refers to life as being filled with “persistent dread.” The darkness of this moment is offset with playful banter between the two. The poem concludes with the first speaker referencing “martial law” and the Garden of Eden as the source of many of their problems."

The poem begins by lamenting the loss of artistic clarity and quickly goes on to blame this loss on the writer's historical circumstances. The poet regards their environment as stifling, claustrophobic, and utterly incompatible with poetic expression. However, it becomes clear that he also regards poetry as his best chance of transcending the horrors that surround him, and so feels compelled to keep writing as best he can.

could go on swinging until the crack of Doom.

I should say I watched them at least an hour
and, to do the men justice, their slow efforts
to overcome the secret problem did continue –
then gradually slackened and finally ceased.

One massive man after another abandoned
his position and leaned on the iron rail
to gaze down like a mystic into the water.
No one spoke; no one said what they saw;



though one fellow did spit, and with round eyes
followed the trajectory of his brown bolus
(he had been chewing tobacco)
on its slow descent into the same depths.

The foreman, and the most original thinker,
smoked a cigarette to relieve the tension.
Afterwards, and with a heavy kind of majesty,
he turned on his heels and walked away.

With this eclipse of interest, the incident
was suddenly closed. First in ones and twos,
then altogether, the men followed. That left
the pile still in mid-air, and me of course.","The men were a shambles of a pile, a massive affair",'From the Journal of a Disappointed Man' by Andrew Motion describes the actions of construction workers who labor to build a pier. The poem takes the reader through the narrator's initial impression of the men and then how that impression evolves as he studies them. He admits his fascination with their actions and minds and eventually comes to different conclusions about their inner lives and the dynamic between them and the rest of the world.
326,326,326,"Between plunging valleys, on a bareback of hill
Men in bunting colours
Bounced, and their blown ball bounced.

The blown ball jumped, and the merry-coloured men
Spouted like water to head it.
The ball blew away downwind –

The rubbery men bounced after it.
The ball jumped up and out and hung in the wind
Over a gulf of treetops.
Then they all shouted together, and the blown ball blew back.
Winds from fiery holes in heaven
Piled the hills darkening around them
To awe them. The glare light
Mixed its mad oils and threw glooms.
Then the rain lowered a steel press.

Hair plastered, they all just trod water
To puddle glitter. And their shouts bobbed up
Coming fine and thin, washed and happy

While the humped world sank foundering
And the valleys blued unthinkable

And the goalie flew horizontal

'Football at Slack' by Ted Hughes presents a beautiful image of a hill and a few men playing football there. In the poem, during the match suddenly the football went down the hill and got stuck on a tree. Those men gathered there and shouted at the ball. But it rolled down in the valley. During this moment, clouds covered the sky and it started raining. The splash of rain made them forget about the ball. Therefore, they started to enjoy the moment. At the end of the poem, the rain stopped and the sun appeared in the sky again like a “golden holocaust”."

Makes in my mind such pause and abrupt ease

Balking the hasty traffic, which must sit

Deliberately the drawbridge starts to rise:
The horns are hushed, the oilsmoke rarefies,

The packet's smooth approach, the slip,
Slip of the silken river past the sides,
The ringing of clear bells, the dip
And slow cascading of the paddle wheel.","The horns are hushed, the oilsmoke rarefies,","In 'A Simile for Her Smile,' Wilbur admires the smile of his lover by comparing it to the “idling motors” near highway bridge gates. In this poem, the speaker talks about how the thought of his lover's smile alone, or even the hope that she is smiling, is enough to put his mind at ease. He uses the words “pause” and “abrupt ease” to convey his mental state while thinking about her pleasant, smiling face. No matter what he thinks at the moment, the thought of her smile brightens him up. In the rest of the poem, Wilbur describes traffic halting near bridge gates. The scene is frustrating yet tranquil. Wilbur's use of soothing terms sets a calming tone in the entire text, exuding the pleasure of watching his beloved smile."

Alexander begins the poem in the present tense with the scene of the trial of four white policemen who brutally beat Rodney King without caring about his civil rights. There were two black men (one King himself and another might be his lawyer) trying to convince the bench of white men that the event, indeed, is in strict violation of civil rights. Then the speaker talks about a separate event at her office where she convinces her boss not to use the word “niggardly” in front of her again. Though this word is tied with the etymology of “nigger” or “negroes”, she somehow feels offended for the resonance of the double “g” sound. Just after the event, she dreams of another scene, where she finds herself in a rodent-filled office that makes her not only feel offended but a bit scared. Her boss advises her to keep her space clean in order to keep these vermin away. In the next lines, Alexander keeps readers engaged in the main subject of the poem that whether the police's actions can be justified. Alongside that, she asks, can African Americans really get along if such events keep occurring in the United States?"

Housman is a moralistic poem that tells of a young man's mistakes in love, despite being given advice. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker describes how when he was 21 years old a wise man gave him some advice. He was told that he would have better luck in love if he gave all his money away first. And surprisingly the speaker did not take the Wiseman out his word and so he did not give away his possessions. But, as the poem concludes, the speaker says that now he's 22 and understands not the man was right."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that the world is used by women as a looking glass. They look out at its innumerable changes and transformations and see their own path through time. When their worlds change, they know that they are changing too. Death is coming closer and soon they will be among the withered flowers on the ground. In the second stanza, the speaker pushes the idea that just because a beautiful thing has been transformed doesn’t mean that it has lost any of its worth. She gives examples of dried lavender and violets. The final stanza explains how womankind need not subscribe to the societal standards of value and beauty. There is much to be gained through age, such as wisdom on “good and ill.” She also expressed the simple fact that nothing happening now is new. Life on earth is born, ages, and then dies. That is how it’s always been and how it always will be."

But stop and loiter all the time, to sing it in extatic songs.","Beginning my studies, the first step pleas’d me so much, The mere fact,","'Beginning My Studies' by Walt Whitman is a simple poem that addresses the joy the speaker felt when stepping out into the natural world. In six lines the poem depicts for the reader the overwhelming joy the speaker felt upon being able to step outside into nature and investigate. He did not have to go farther than the first step before he knew that he was far enough. The connections between creatures, forms, sights, and sounds thrilled him. The last line states that he wanted to sing out his joy in “ecstatic song,” a clear reference to this poem and all the other poetry Whitman wrote on the theme of nature."

And coral reefs lie bare,
Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair.

Its webs of living gauze no more unfurl;
Wrecked is the ship of pearl!
And every chambered cell,
Where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell,
As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell,
Before thee lies revealed,—
Its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed!

That spread his lustrous coil;
Still, as the spiral grew,

Stole with soft step its shining archway through,
Built up its idle door,
Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more.

Child of the wandering sea,
Cast from her lap, forlorn!
From thy dead lips a clearer note is born

Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,
As the swift seasons roll!

Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,

In the first stanza of this poem, the speaker describes, in complimentary terms, the struggle that the nautilus engages in as it attempts to construct more perfect compartments within its shell. He speaks about the creature's death, its creation of a new home, and more. As the poem progresses, the speaker addresses the nautilus itself, thanking it for the message it delivers through its existence. The final stanza is addressed to the speaker's soul, asking it to take strength from the nautilus' life and construct evermore perfect structures or improve the speaker's own spirituality and the strength of their soul."

Montague's speaker depicts the land's history, and the neighbour explains stories and legends that they both can relate to and appreciate. As the walk comes to an end the neighbour asks that the speaker remember the clear-headed conversation they had and tell others that it's possible."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he can see two kings and one man without any laurels. It is this person who catches his attention the most. In the following lines, he describes what feelings he gets from this man and the sights which surround his broken tombstone. In the final couplet, it is revealed that the men are the greek playwrights Æschylos, Sophokles, and Euripides. It is Euripides with whom the speaker is so taken. He is deeply interested in the writer's disappointing reception by the public during his lifetime. It is not until after death he is recognized."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that she is seeking out a relationship that allows her to become lost in love. This does not seem to be the situation she is currently in as she states that she is “not yours.” The speaker does not belong to the relationship she is currently in, nor to the person who is her partner. In the next lines, she describes her ideal relationship as being one that allows her to become like a “candle lit at noon.” She will be burning amongst a great plethora of light. The next section of lines are used to remind the listener that she does still care about them. It is not exactly this person's fault she is unhappy—they are still “beautiful and bright.” The poem concludes with the speaker stating that she is ready to give herself to a “deep…love” which takes over her sense and sweeps her away like a “taper in a rushing wind.”"

There is more for him to do in life than spend time with this lover and at this moment this appears to be something he's glad about.

from our economic horrors, a master's hand awakens

and legendary chromatics in the setting sun.

Comedy drips on the grass stages.
And the distress of the poor and of the weak

in the center of the Celestial Empire;

This first paragraph presents an extensive sentence. The opening of Historic Evening situates the reader in a particular moment of the day, but with no specification of the date or of the hour in which the actions described take place (“In whatever evening”). The lyrical voice depicts the movements of the “simple tourist”, which are also undetermined, and how he/she wants to escape from “economic horrors”. This figure, according to the lyrical voice, is able to discover several things which are listed in the sentence (“the hand of a master wakes the harpsichord of meadows; cards are okayed in the depths of the pond […] evoker of queens and favorites; there are saints, sails, and threads of harmony, and legendary chromaticism in the sunset”). These descriptions use greatly evocative words and build strong natural images, such as that of the pond and of the sunset. Thus, this first paragraph establishes this figure's search over things he/she didn't explore before. Second Paragraph He shudders at the passing of the hunts and the hordes. Drama drips on the platforms of turf. And the superfluity of the poor and the weak on these stupid levels! This second paragraph continues the description of the exploration of the “simple tourist”. The “simple tourist” seems to fear “the hunts and the hordes”. On the next sentences, the lyrical voice will continue to use highly evocative language, as in the first paragraph. The “simple tourist” is still discovering things in this “whatever evening”. Notice the last sentence, and how this is a comment from the lyrical voice towards the understanding of the poor, the weak, and this “simple tourist”. Third Paragraph To his slave's eye, Germany towers upwards toward moons; Tartar deserts light up; ancient revolts foment at the heart of the Celestial Empire; along the stairways and armchairs of rocks a little world, pale and flat, is to be built. Then a ballet of known seas and nights; chemistry without virtue, and impossible melodies. This third paragraph focuses on strong images that appear to the “simple tourist”. This figure sees a vision of the world and how it works. The figure, with his “slave's eye” and “retiring from economic horrors”, sees diverse groups of people. The construction of the first sentence is similar to that of the first paragraph: the figure is mentioned in a certain circumstance and there is an enumeration of the visions he/she has. Notice that the words are greatly evocative and they build strong imagery that continues with the theme used in the previous paragraphs. Fourth Paragraph The same bourgeois magic wherever the packet-boat deposits us! The most elementary physicist feels it is no longer to possible to submit oneself to this personal atmosphere, this fog of physical remorse, observation of which is already an affliction. The fourth paragraph, rather than describing the actions of the figure mentioned, focuses on the lyrical voice. The lyrical voice appears to be making a statement about the historical and cultural context that surrounds both him/her and the figure described (the “simple tourist”). Historic Evening changes its tone and abandons the lyrical descriptions that were made in the previous paragraphs. According to the lyrical voice, it is impossible to escape from the “bourgeois magic” no matter where you go (“wherever the packet-boat deposits us!”). Furthermore, the following sentence describes this feeling of entrapment that the lyrical voice expresses in the first part of the paragraph. Fifth Paragraph No! The moment of the steam room, of evaporating seas, of subterranean conflagrations, of the wandering planet and the consequent exterminations, certainties indicated with so little malice by the Bible and the Norns which it will fall to the serious being to witness – However it will be no matter of legend! The last paragraph expands the message already stated in the fourth paragraph. The lyrical voice continues talking about the “bourgeois magic” and the inability to escape from it (“The moment of the steam room, of evaporating seas, of subterranean conflagrations, of the wandering planet and the consequent exterminations”). The feeling towards the present is reflected in the lyrical voice's description and in the immersion made in the pattern of the elements mentioned. The poem finishes with a strong statement made by the lyrical voice (“However it will be no matter of legend!”). This sentence shows the lyrical voice's reflection on bourgeois life and capitalism. Furthermore, this particular historical moment, according to the lyrical voice, “will be no matter of legend!” opposing his/her present to a much yearned past time."

The poem begins with the speaker telling the listener, who is the ghost, that he has come to interview her. He knows that she is “Voiceless” but they are able to communicate in other ways. In the first stanza, he describes how much work it took to track the ghost down. She is always leading him off to various locations. Many of these remind him of how lonely he is now. When they do eventually come back together it is in one or more of the places they spent time together when she was alive. The speaker is deeply moved by the familiar sights and sounds. His whole life is improved by the evening and night he's able to spend with her. She has to go when the sun rises, but he doesn't mind. He believes that she will be able to bring him back to the same areas again. They don't have to be apart for the rest of the time. It is possible to have temporary moments that return them to the past. Read more of Thomas Hardy's poetry."

Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?

TYBALT
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
A villain that is hither come in spite,
To scorn at our solemnity this night.

CAPULET
Young Romeo is it?

TYBALT
'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

CAPULET
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
He bears him like a portly gentleman;
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
I would not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement:
Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
It is my will, the which if thou respect,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

TYBALT
It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
I'll not endure him.

CAPULET
He shall be endured:
What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
Am I the master here, or you? go to.
You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!

TYBALT
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

CAPULET
Go to, go to;
You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
Be quiet, or—More light, more light! For shame!
I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!

TYBALT
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

ROMEO
[To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

JULIET
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

ROMEO
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

JULIET
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

ROMEO
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

JULIET
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

ROMEO
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.

JULIET
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

ROMEO
Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
Give me my sin again.

JULIET
You kiss by the book.

What is her mother?

Shall have the chinks.

Away, begone; the sport is at the best.

ROMEO
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all

I'll to my rest.

JULIET
What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

Nurse
I know not.

JULIET
Go ask his name: if he be married.
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

Nurse
His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
The only son of your great enemy.

JULIET
My only love sprung from my only hate!
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
That I must love a loathed enemy.

What's this? what's this?

Of one I danced withal.

Within these lines Shakespeare uses an extended metaphor, comparing Romeo to a pilgrim and Juliet to a religious/holy site, to describe their relationship. Romeo acts reverentially, cleverly convincing Juliet to let him kiss her while also treating her as a saint."

These words paint a picture for the readers of the horrible imagery of war at the doorstep of home. It reveals the way that it changed people and the painful loss that came with it.

It is primarily a poem about Keats' fear of mortality, however in true Keatsian fashion, death is also the solution for more of what ails Keats. It would be prudent to remember that Keats' poems have all, in some way, featured death; death of nature, death of love, death of memory, but death all in all. There are few poems, in fact, that does not reference the ending of things. 'When I have Fears that I may Cease to Be' is effusive with imagery, sensual in its description of the fears that Keats possesses, and short. Keats runs the gamut from worrying about dying before he is famous, worrying about the death of his beloved, and then deciding that death itself is not such a terrible situation."

the name had been changed
somewhere between Angel Island and the sea,
when my father the paperson
in the late 1950s
obsessed with a bombshell blond
transliterated “Mei Ling” to “Marilyn.”
And nobody dared question
his initial impulse—for we all know
lust drove men to greatness,
not goodness, not decency.
And there I was, a wayward pink baby,
named after some tragic white woman
swollen with gin and Nembutal.
My mother couldn't pronounce the “r.”
She dubbed me “Numba one female offshoot”
for brevity: henceforth, she will live and die
in sublime ignorance, flanked
by loving children and the “kitchen deity.”
While my father dithers,
a tomcat in Hong Kong trash—
a gambler, a petty thug,
who bought a chain of chopsuey joints
in Piss River, Oregon,
with bootlegged Gucci cash.
Nobody dared question his integrity given
his nice, devout daughters
and his bright, industrious sons
as if filial piety were the standard
by which all earthly men are measured.

Oh, how trustworthy our daughters,
how thrifty our sons!
How we've managed to fool the experts

Indeed, they can use us.
But the “Model Minority” is a tease.
We know you are watching now,
so we refuse to give you any!
Oh, bamboo shoots, bamboo shoots!
The further west we go, we'll hit east;
the deeper down we dig, we'll find China.
History has turned its stomach
on a black polluted beach—
where life doesn't hinge
on that red, red wheelbarrow,

in the final episode of “Santa Barbara”
will lean over a scented candle
and call us a “bitch.”

A third, the sad, brutish one
may never, never marry.
And I, his least favorite—
“not quite boiled, not quite cooked,”
a plump pomfret simmering in my juices—
too listless to fight for my people's destiny.

neither cherished nor vanquished,

when one day heaven was unmerciful,

or the jaws of a metaphysical Godzilla,
it swallowed her whole.

Chin spends the poem addressing her life as a Chinese-American immigrant, brought to America when she was young. She notes how her father changed her name at the beginning of the poem, attempting to Americanize it. At the same time, she also discusses her father's personality and the dishonest way that he made his money. Throughout, she tries to explain how difficult it was growing up in two different worlds and trying to get the approval of both. The poet also depicts how she believes her ancestors judge her while also trying to judge herself more fairly."

Throughout the lines of this piece, Jarrell's speaker, a deceased soldier, describes his birth and innocence while juxtaposing it with his job as a gunner and death. The first lines describe how he was born from his mother's dream into “the State” or a new, more violent understanding of life. There, he hunkers down inside a new womb, the ball turret. His days are filled with black flak and nightmarish scenes of life and death. The poem's final line reveals that the speaker is dead, and his remains were washed from the “womb” with a hose."

The speaker spends the first stanza of the poem describing their reaction to a piece of news, someone they care deeply for has passed away. This person, who goes unnamed and mostly undescribed throughout the poem was incredibly close to them. They're surrounded by a new emptiness that makes them feel both raw and numb. The funeral occurs, and the speaker considers the nature of death and the rituals surrounding burying someone. After the person is gone, and an amount of time has passed, the speaker still finds themselves moved by the loss. They go to their lost loved one's grave and lie on the ground, as close to this person as they can be.

When they go towards the summer isle, they'll find peace. There will be everything that one could hope to find in the natural world. This includes rivers, flowers, cotton trees, and more.

In the poem, the poet describes, in great and loving detail, his love for the place Romney Marsh, with a particular reverence given to the beauty and the placement of Romney Marsh, and with a familiarity that makes the poem read almost like a love poem. Wordsworth is still, perhaps, the better-known landscape poet, the one who has written ditties to nature and particularly to man's influence on nature, but a Wordsworthian poem is always slightly removed from the reality of the situation. In Romney Marsh does not have this problem: the love the poet has for it is a visible and obvious love that lasts despite the place's flaws, and influence on other things. It is particularly important to read knowing that it is still an area of beauty that exists, and is safeguarded by the British government, though its purpose has changed ever since the switch from sheep farming to arable production. That being said, a lot of British landscape poems betray a familiarity to the area that is almost loving, and this is certainly true of Romney Marsh. It is easy to believe that he has grown up there, despite the fact that John Davidson is a Scottish poet."

With its horns through mist and the castle

Pears and red currants

Forgotten mornings when he walked with his mother
Through the parables
Of sun light
And the legends of the green chapels
And the twice told fields of infancy
That his tears burned my cheeks and his heart moved in mine.

Where a boy

Summertime of the dead whispered the truth of his joy
To the trees and the stones and the fish in the tide.
And the mystery

Still in the water and singingbirds.

Away but the weather turned around. And the true
Joy of the long dead child sang burning
In the sun.

Still be sung
On this high hill in a year's turning.",A springful of larks in a rolling Cloud and the roadside bushes,"Poem in October' by Dylan Thomas tells of a speaker's journey out of autumn and up a hill to reclaim childhood joy, the summer season, and his spirituality. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he was thirty years old when he wrote this. It was his birthday and he chose to go on a walk. He left his home, traveled alongside the water's edge, listened to the seabirds and the woods. The speaker left the town behind and began a climb up a nearby hill. As he rose the town shrank. At the same time, the season began to change. Autumn, and it's cool air, faded away and the summer returned. The rain continued as he climbed, as did the presence of birds. These two images are crucial to the speaker's understanding of happiness and childhood. When he finally got to the top of the hill it was like he had reached heaven. He was far above the coolness of autumn and he became absorbed with memories of his childhood. The speaker recalled coming to his place with his mother and what it meant to him. He hoped while on the hill that the joy he experienced will last throughout the year. Perhaps he will return to reclaim it when he turns thirty-one."

Crunching beneath our feet;
Behind us as we walked along the parkway,
Our shadows danced,
Fantastic shapes in vivid blue.
Across the lake the skaters
Flew to and fro,
With sharp turns weaving
A frail invisible net.
In ecstasy the earth
Drank the silver sunlight;
In ecstasy the skaters
Drank the wine of speed;
In ecstasy we laughed
Drinking the wine of love.
Had not the music of our joy
Sounded its highest note?
But no,
For suddenly, with lifted eyes you said,
“Oh look!”
There, on the black bough of a snow flecked maple,
Fearless and gay as our love,
A bluejay cocked his crest!

Or set the bounds of beauty?","The snow shivered beneath our feet, Our shadows danced, Fantastic shapes","A Winter Blue Jay' by Sara Teasdale tells of a perfect day in which the speaker and her companion find the pinnacle of their love, and then surpass it. The poem begins by placing the couple in a snow-covered landscape, walking through the “whisper[ing]” snow, enjoying a quiet moment. Their shadows are “danc[ing]” behind them, creating a beautiful pattern of light. It is clear that this moment is not one that comes often. They continue on their walk and come upon skaters on a frozen lake who gracefully, without fault, weave around one another. Their grace and effortless beauty mimic the day and improve upon it still. Finally, the speaker asks if they have reached the “highest point” of their happiness and she decides that they have not as her companion points out a bluejay. The jay is proud of it's own form and fearless in its assertions of life. The bird is like their love is that day, without worry for the future and enjoying the perfect moment the day has brought. The poem concludes with an optimistic statement about happiness. That when one believes they have reached the pinnacle of their life, in which nothing could increase their joy, there may be more around the corner waiting for them."

This lyrical poem starts with the speaker longing for old age. This is because the speaker believes that youth is full of pain and misery. They believe that this pain and misery arises out of happiness, and that they are two sides of the same coin. Old age, on the other hand, is sad and cold by itself, and there is no happiness to speak of. This is why the pain and misery that so affects youth does not have any impact on old age."

The poem describes the assignment, one page of writing, and the speaker's apprehension about completing it. He isn't sure that he's going to be able to simply sit down and write. He is sure that it's more complicated than that. His apprehension turns into success as he mulls over his feelings and explores his personality and heritage. He speaks on his similarities to his classmates and his differences, as well as his relationship with the white instructor."

Before I,"'The Retreat' by Henry Vaughan describes a speaker's desire to escape to the past where he was a younger, purer, and generally happier human being. The poem begins with the speaker mourning for the lost days of his childhood. He longs to return to a time when he was in his “angel infancy” and had yet to be influenced by the dark forces of the world. It would be a time in which he had yet to stray far from his home or realize the struggle that would take him over internally. In the present day, he worries about his own emotions and his sinful nature. He is concerned over his own being in a way that was not even considered when he was young. In the final lines, the speaker describes the end of his life and how he will return to the dust of the earth. This will be the penultimate ending for a man who longs for his previous life."
359,359,359,"That’s my last Duchess painted on the wall,
Looking as if she were alive. I call
That piece a wonder, now; Fra Pandolf’s hands
Worked busily a day, and there she stands.
Will’t please you sit and look at her? I said
“Fra Pandolf” by design, for never read
Strangers like you that pictured countenance,
The depth and passion of its earnest glance,
But to myself they turned (since none puts by
The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)
And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,
How such a glance came there; so, not the first
Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, ’twas not
Her husband’s presence only, called that spot
Of joy into the Duchess’ cheek; perhaps
Fra Pandolf chanced to say, “Her mantle laps
Over my lady’s wrist too much,” or “Paint
Must never hope to reproduce the faint
Half-flush that dies along her throat.” Such stuff
Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough
For calling up that spot of joy. She had
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad,
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.
Sir, ’twas all one! My favour at her breast,
The dropping of the daylight in the West,
The bough of cherries some officious fool
Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule
She rode with round the terrace—all and each
Would draw from her alike the approving speech,
Or blush, at least. She thanked men—good! but thanked
Somehow—I know not how—as if she ranked
My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name
With anybody’s gift. Who’d stoop to blame
This sort of trifling? Even had you skill
In speech—which I have not—to make your will
Quite clear to such an one, and say, “Just this
Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,
Or there exceed the mark”—and if she let
Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set
Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse—
E’en then would be some stooping; and I choose
Never to stoop. Oh, sir, she smiled, no doubt,
Whene’er I passed her; but who passed without
Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;
Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands
As if alive. Will’t please you rise? We’ll meet
The company below, then. I repeat,
The Count your master’s known munificence
Is ample warrant that no just pretense
Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;

At starting, is my object. Nay, we’ll go

The poem is set at night, a few hours before Christ's birth. The poem begins with a request to the villagers to keep their doors open to welcome those who are standing outside in the “frosty tide”. The speaker of the poem depicts their condition. They are standing in the cold and waiting to enter one of the houses. There is a sense of waiting in everyone's tone as something great is going to happen in the morning. Thereafter, the poet quickly shifts to the story of Joseph and Mary. After being tired of walking, they entered into a thatch. It is that holy but lowly stable where Christ was born at the stroke of daybreak on 25th December."

The poem expresses a speaker's desire to find someone who truly loves him before he loses his life or goes mad. He states that he's willing to endure anything as long as he gets to have the “sweet” experience that others have before him. The tone throughout the poem is concise and determined, helping Tennyson craft a hopeful and at times desperate mood. 'O let the solid ground' speaks on themes of love, the purpose of life, and loss."

To tell you a story of the long dark way
That I had to climb, that I had to know
In order that the race might live and grow.
Look at my face - dark as the night -
Yet shining like the sun with love's true light.
I am the dark girl who crossed the red sea
Carrying in my body the seed of the free.
I am the woman who worked in the field
Bringing the cotton and the corn to yield.
I am the one who labored as a slave,
Beaten and mistreated for the work that I gave -
Children sold away from me, I'm husband sold, too.
No safety, no love, no respect was I due.

Three hundred years in the deepest South:
But God put a song and a prayer in my mouth.
God put a dream like steel in my soul.
Now, through my children, I'm reaching the goal.

Now, through my children, young and free,
I realized the blessing deed to me.
I couldn't read then. I couldn't write.
I had nothing, back there in the night.
Sometimes, the valley was filled with tears,
But I kept trudging on through the lonely years.
Sometimes, the road was hot with the sun,
But I had to keep on till my work was done:
I had to keep on! No stopping for me -
I was the seed of the coming Free.
I nourished the dream that nothing could smother
Deep in my breast - the Negro mother.
I had only hope then, but now through you,
Dark ones of today, my dreams must come true:
All you dark children in the world out there,
Remember my sweat, my pain, my despair.
Remember my years, heavy with sorrow -
And make of those years a torch for tomorrow.
Make of my pass a road to the light
Out of the darkness, the ignorance, the night.
Lift high my banner out of the dust.
Stand like free men supporting my trust.
Believe in the right, let none push you back.
Remember the whip and the slaver's track.
Remember how the strong in struggle and strife
Still bar you the way, and deny you life -
But march ever forward, breaking down bars.
Look ever upward at the sun and the stars.

Impel you forever up the great stairs -

The African American slaves lived through the worst brutality known to have taken place on American soil. The Negro Mother, although written by Langston Hughes, a man, comes to readers through the voice of a woman and a former slave. She writes to her children, challenging them to pick up the torch and to carry it on, fighting for freedom and equality. Her words paint the image of a strong and passionate black woman who has been abused and mistreated, but who has not succumbed to oppression but has risen above it with a passion in her heart and a song in her mouth. These are the words she wants every black child in America to take to heart."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that the cemetery is full of trees and grasses which are unwilling to shed their summer leaves and colours. They cling desperately and uselessly to their foliage. Just as the plants attempt to maintain life into the winter, so too does humanity seek something after death. The next two stanzas are used to explain, in impassioned detail, that there is nothing magical about the cemetery. It is clear by the end of the poem that the speaker is set in her opinion about the land. She feels it is only relevant for its physical and “essential “parts."

This piece begins by describing the world that the men in the poem are going to be attempting to leave. The world is “dull grey mist” and the “sullen roar of the sea.” There is nothing there but the reminders of all the tragedies and failures of the past. All are seeking to rise above it. Also described is, “Morning Land.” A metaphorical utopia that is the breeding ground for “rest and love” and “hope for brain and hand.” This world represents the grass that is always greener on the other side and the human desire to improve one's circumstances. The poem continues and the reader gets additional detail about how difficult this climb up the mountainside is. Many fall to their deaths, only to be replaced by others just as eager. No one is deterred by critics and cowards, they climb onward. Additionally, these men climbing are forging a path for others to follow so that all may reach this utopia out of the reach of strife."

Even if the two are separated, he knows that nothing could temper the love he has for this young man. He compares himself through a simile to a traveler who always comes home.

As the poem progresses she moves on to directly speak about “great souls” and how human beings react to loss.

Men had not paused to answer. Foes distraught
Pierced the thinned peoples in a brute-like blindness,
Philosophies that sages long had taught,
And Selflessness, were as an unknown thought,
And “Hell!” and “Shell!” were yapped at Lovingkindness.

There has been much anger, fury, despair and passion amongst those fighting and those “feeble folk” who are at home but still immersed in the war. No one has been able to escape it.

The speaker chooses non-fictional titles for their personal tales in order to include the experiences of those who had to immigrate to a new country. “Survival Strategies and the Melancholy of Racial Assimilation” and “Patterns of Love in Peoples of Diaspora” are some of the titles he uses to talk about immigrant experiences, such as internalizing an alien language, sense of disconnection, and inner mutism."

- Matthew Arnold, 'Dover Beach'

Stowed in the sea to invade
the alfresco lash of a diesel-breeze
ratcheting speed into the tide, brunt with
gobfuls of surf phlegmed by cushy come-and-go
tourists prow'd on the cruisers, lording the ministered waves.

Seagull and shoal life
vexing their blarnies upon our huddled
camouflage past the vast crumble of scummed
cliffs, scramming on mulch as thunder unbladders
yobbish rain and wind on our escape hutched in a Bedford van.

Seasons or years we reap
inland, unclocked by the national eye
or stabs in the back, teemed for breathing
sweeps of grass through the whistling asthma of parks,
burdened, ennobled - poling sparks across pylon and pylon.

Swarms of us, grafting in
the black within shot of the moon's
spotlight, banking on the miracle of sun -
span its rainbow, passport us to life. Only then
can it be human to hoick ourselves, bare-faced for the clear.

Imagine my love and I,
our sundry others, Blair'd in the cash
of our beeswax'd cars, our crash clothes, free,
we raise our charged glasses over unparasol'd tables
East, babbling our lingoes, flecked by the chalk of Britannia!"," 'Dover Beach' - Matthew Arnold, 'Dover Beach'</s","'Look We Have Coming to Dover!' by Daljit Nagra tells of the arrival of immigrants to England and of their lives filled with hard work, fears, and dreams. The poem begins with the speaker describing the terrifying arrival into Dover There is nothing beautiful about this scene. The water is dirty, the tourists lord over them and they fear being spotted. When they finally make it to shore they drive off in an inconspicuous van and try to make lives for themselves. These are hard lives, filled with endless work and the ever-present fear that they're going to be caught and returned to their home country. At the same time, they are able to hope for a better future, as described in the final stanza."
371,371,371,"God of lost souls, thou who are lost amongst the gods, hear me:
 
Gentle Destiny that watchest over us, mad, wandering spirits, hear me:
 
I dwell in the midst of a perfect race, I the most imperfect.
 
I, a human chaos, a nebula of confused elements, I move amongst finished worlds—peoples of complete laws and pure order, whose thoughts are assorted, whose dreams are arranged, and whose visions are enrolled and registered.
 
Their virtues, O God, are measured, their sins are weighed, and even the countless things that pass in the dim twilight of neither sin nor virtue are recorded and catalogued.
 
Here days and night are divided into seasons of conduct and governed by rules of blameless accuracy.
 
To eat, to drink, to sleep, to cover one’s nudity, and then to be weary in due time.
 
To work, to play, to sing, to dance, and then to lie still when the clock strikes the hour.
 
To think thus, to feel thus much, and then to cease thinking and feeling when a certain star rises above yonder horizon.
 
To rob a neighbour with a smile, to bestow gifts with a graceful wave of the hand, to praise prudently, to blame cautiously, to destroy a sound with a word, to burn a body with a breath, and then to wash the hands when the day’s work is done.
 
To love according to an established order, to entertain one’s best self in a preconceived manner, to worship the gods becomingly, to intrigue the devils artfully—and then to forget all as though memory were dead.
 
To fancy with a motive, to contemplate with consideration, to be happy sweetly, to suffer nobly—and then to empty the cup so that tomorrow may fill it again.
 
All these things, O God, are conceived with forethought, born with determination, nursed with exactness, governed by rules, directed by reason, and then slain and buried after a prescribed method. And even their silent graves that lie within the human soul are marked and numbered.
 
It is a perfect world, a world of consummate excellence, a world of supreme wonders, the ripest fruit in God’s garden, the master-thought of the universe.
 
But why should I be here, O God, I a green seed of unfulfilled passion, a mad tempest that seeketh neither east nor west, a bewildered fragment from a burnt planet?
 
Why am I here, O God of lost souls, thou who art lost amongst the gods?","I dwell in the midst of a perfect race, I the most imperfect. I,","The Perfect World' by Kahlil Gibran describes what a speaker sees as an ideal way to live in order to take advantage of all that God has created, and thereby craft a perfect world. The poem begins with the speaker asking God, the protector of lost souls to watch over him. He is concerned for his own destiny and wants to know why he was created. The speaker does not see himself as being able to attain the high levels of order and structure that appear in the following twenty or so lines. He begins by wondering over his own confused state and how he is supped to exist in-amongst those who have their whole lives figured. He sees the rest of the world as being made up of people who know what to feel, where they're going, and how they're going to get there. In contrast, his thoughts are confused and his emotions unpredictable. As the poem progresses the speaker lays out an impossible standard of life. A perfect world, he believes, would be created if all people were always their best selves, worshiped God perfectly, and lived without conflict. By the end of the text, he has become somewhat desperate and perhaps depressed as he attempts to figure out how he can live as they do."
372,372,372,"Time does not bring relief; you all have lied Who told me time would ease me of my pain! I miss him in the weeping of the rain; I want him at the shrinking of the tide;

Heaped on my heart, and my old thoughts abide. There are a hundred places where I fear To go,—so with his memory they brim.

The poem begins with this speaker chastising her listeners for lying to her. They told her that any pain she feels, on account of a lost lover, would fade away in time. She is angry because this has not come close to happening. One can assume that a great deal of time has passed, and the speaker's emotions are just as strong as they were when the hurt was fresh. She describes how her longing for her lover is omnipresent. It comes to her in the rain and with tidal changes. In the second stanza, she tells of all the changes she sees going on in the world. The speaker is aware that time is passing around her, but it doesn't touch her inner world. The snow might be melting on the mountains and the leaves being turned into smoke on the road, but she is the same as always. The final lines describe how these emotions have impacted her. Now, no matter where she goes, even if its somewhere he never was, she is “stricken” with thoughts of him. He haunts her heart and mind, in every setting and situation."

The poem compares the rider to his horse and takes the reader through several examples of different ways that men ride. There are those who much more careless with their lives and their horses than others are. They appear to care not whether they end up in the afterlife. The way the horse moves tells the onlooker a lot about the nature of the rider. A horse can also learn about their “guider” in this same way.
375,375,375,"I can remember you, child,
As I stood in a hot, white
Room at the window watching
The people and cars taking
Turn at the traffic lights.
I can remember you, our first
Fierce confrontation, the tight
Red rope of love which we both
Fought over. It was a square
Environmental blank, disinfected
Of paintings or toys. I wrote
All over the walls with my
Words, coloured the clean squares
With the wild, tender circles
Of our struggle to become
Separate. We want, we shouted,
To be two, to be ourselves.

Neither won nor lost the struggle
In the glass tank clouded with feelings
Which changed us both. Still I am fighting
You off, as you stand there
With your straight, strong, long
Brown hair and your rosy,
Defiant glare, bringing up
From the heart’s pool that old rope,
Tightening about my life,
Trailing love and conflict,
As you ask may you skate
In the dark, for one more hour.","I can remember you, our first Fierce confrontation, the tight Red rope of love which","This poem, ‘Catrin’, displays the love and turmoil in the parent-child relationship. This particular poem centers around a conflict that seems to have escalated into fury rather quickly. Through her use of imagery, the speaker is able to convey feelings of love and affection along with the frustration of dealing with the conflict that inevitably arises between the parent and the child. At the beginning of the poem, the speaker reveals that the person to whom she speaks is a child, but she does not reveal her position immediately. Because the author is female, it is easy to assume that the speaker is the mother. For simplicity’s sake, this analysis will assume as such, and thereby refer to the speaker in the feminine form. However, it is entirely possible that the speaker was the father, in this case. The gender of the child in the poem is not implied until near the end of the poem. Based on the voice of the speaker and the short description of the child, it is most probable that ‘Catrin’ describes a conflict between a mother and daughter. The conflict itself remains unresolved by the end of the poem, but both the mother and the daughter are apparently changed. The intensity of the argument has moved them both, though the speaker does not reveal the specific changes that have taken place. By the end of the poem, the reader can clearly understand the rationale behind the mother’s side of the argument. Allowing the reader to see this rationale also allows him to enter into the feelings of the mother. Just like the mother, the reader is also unable to open the eyes of the child to the practical nature of the mother’s decision. Thus, the reader can enter into the mother’s feelings. The speaker uses concrete imagery to describe her love for the child. This also allows the reader to further understand the complexity of the relationship and the intensity of the conflict. Though the mother is clearly “right” by the end of the poem, she does not feel that she “won”. Rather, she feels as though she has lost something. The daughter, also, clearly feels that she has lost. Somehow, the intensity of this argument has changed both the mother and the daughter. It was clearly a marked turning point in their lives and relationship. Through the vivid description of this conflict, the speaker is able to portray the deep love and affection that a mother has for her child, a love that will drive her to protect and love her children even when the children do not want or understand the need for the protection. The mother continues to love and fight for the protection of her daughter even when the daughter fights against it, giving her a “defiant glare” that leaves the mother feeling that something between them has changed forever. The name of the poem reveals that this poem is, indeed, about her daughter, Catrin."

The illustrations are brightly colored and entertaining all on their own.

Seuss stated that this book, of all those that he had written, was his favorite. He went on to describe how it allowed him to address both environmental and economic issues and express his exaggeration with the world.

There, the speaker notes, all imagination seems to die. One is left with a silence that feels impenetrable and entirely uncreative.

Bound with the bandage of the arm that drips;
Knit in the welding of the rifle-thong.

Although the war is present, as in all other poetry by Wilfred Owen, it takes a back seat to the description and the liveliness of the soldiers; they are immortalized and made to live before the war brutalized them into insensible men. The Latin title translates to 'an apology on behalf of my poetry'. Although Owen was popularized in later days, at the time he was not considered to be an especially brilliant poet, and being against the war made him a fair few enemies in the pro-war ranks. However, Owen was also a soldier, and his view of camaraderie is very much felt in the lines of 'Apologia Pro Poemate Meo.' In a letter, he wrote to his mother, stating that 'you could not be visited by a band of friends half so fine as surround me here'."

No other sound can be heard in the leaden darkness, except that of the shrill and transient sound of the bird. It is not an ordinary owl. According to the poetic persona, it is “the great black owl.” It seems as if the poet is hinting at something else by referring to this creature. It hoots, “Au” three times and suddenly a voice, probably that of the zoomorphic owl, calls, “Hi! a! haa!”"

Byron’s work, ‘To Caroline’, provides the reader with insights into his very complicated and often troubled relationships with others. Despite the historic nature of the affair, the poem expresses deep sentiments and a strong sense of sorrow. It is an excellent means for assessing some of Lord Byron’s complex character, and a touching piece of poetry as well."

A lot of di Prima's works were centered around feminism, class, and sexuality. It makes sense that this poem particularly talks about the artistic freedom and women's voice in the Beat movement of the '50s as compared to their male counterparts. Throughout this piece, di Prima talks about how poetry is her sustenance (“bread”), and it is a vital part of her life and living. She expresses how the voice of female poets is often muted when it contains strong themes and tones. That's why she fears her poems might be “unspent” and go “underground.” She is aware that her words are not “stone.” Thus, they will not be engraved upon and remain unchanged for centuries. However, she still believes that it will shine with all its might wherever her poetry lands."

They make a point to contrast how “you” might be alone in life but in death “you” are going to be surrounded by spirits of the dead. As the poem progresses, the speaker emphasizes the mysterious nature of death, warns against romanticizing it, and personifies nature."

I love thine iron chime,
To life or death, to heaven or hell,
Which calls the sons of Time.

Thy voice upon the deep
The home-bound sea-boy hails,
It charms his cares to sleep,
It cheers him as he sails.

To house of God and heavenly joys
Thy summons called our sires,
And good men thought thy sacred voice
Disarmed the thunder's fires.

And soon thy music, sad death-bell,
Shall lift its notes once more,
And mix my requiem with the wind
That sweeps my native shore","I love thy music, mellow bell, I love thine iron chim","The Bell' by Ralph Waldo Emerson describes the various functions of a bell while also placing importance on its acknowledgment of death. In the first stanza of this piece the speaker begins by telling one specific bell that it is “mellow.” This “iron” sounding instrument functions in a variety of different ways. It notifies one of birth, death, and “heaven or hell.” Life and time are marked by its chiming. In the next two stanzas, the speaker moves through a number of different moments a bell can be used. The first of these is to notify a ship that land is near. This is a joyous occasion that is then contrasted with the quiet moments of attending church. Its history stretches back to a time that mysticism ruled. Emerson's speaker mentions “good men” attempting to “Disarm” thunder and lightning with the sound of a bell. The poem concludes with the speaker bringing the narrative back to his own life. There has been some tragedy in the area. It is far-stretching enough to call for a “death-bell.” The sound is going to be heard across the shore and mix with the wind and the speaker's own requiem."

How she came to collect children
Because they were crippled or dark or girls.

Covered in garbage, stuffed in bags,
Abandoned at their doorstep.

Thinking the head barely poking above the ground
Was bone or wood, something to chew.

They are American so they know about ceremony
And tradition, about doing things right.

Or how her mother tried to bury her.

Feeling the strangeness of her empty arms.

Sees how she's passed from woman
To woman. She returns to twilight corners.

To the day of her birth, How it happens in some desolate hut
Outside village boundaries
Where mothers go to squeeze out life,

Watch body slither out from body,
Feel for penis or no penis,
Toss the baby to the heap of others,

Trudge home to lie down for their men again.",The sister here is telling my mother How she came to collect children because they were cripple,"'The Deliverer' by Tishani Doshi speaks on the prevalence of female infanticide in rural India and the lives of the women who help to commit it. The poem begins with the speaker stating that she and her mother are in a convent, looking for a child. This child, who was found buried and left for dead, is brought to America. Here she meets her adoptive parents, grows up, and then begins to look into her own story. The final lines describe the terrifying lives of women in rural India and the horrible choices they are forced to make."

This piece is dedicated to Tate's father, who was a co-pilot of a fighting jet. He died in combat in 1944 when Tate was barely a few months old. He did not see his father and grew up only with the memories implanted by others. Through this piece, he tries to show the love he has for his father. He delves through his deep emotions in order to unravel how he actually feels for him. His father did not think of his family nor of his infant child. He selfishly went to the battlefield and died. This poem is all about the loneliness, sadness, and angst of Tate."

In this poem, the speaker talks about how she gathers her imaginary friends like talismans and invites them for tarot card gossip. She imagines how they undress in her mind's studio. Their looks make her so unsettled that she can see a vagina folding itself like a mandala, a symbol of dream and self-fulfillment. The speaker uses their image in order to intensify her bodily desires. She lets the sensual tea steep till the bodily pot becomes black with the liquor. In this heightened state, she does not require anybody's assistance to please herself. Those imaginary characters are impregnated in her own mind. There is no need for any physical pain to seal her bond with them."

The poet narrates the story vividly, dramatically, and with almost a Dantesque concentration. A big bird, a swan with great wings has been represented as giving a sudden and staggering blow to the girl (Leda) bathing naked in a pond. The bird fluttering over her, caressing her thighs, holding her nape with his beak, and pressing her helpless (bare) breast upon his chest, must have been a nerve-shattering experience for the terrified girl. She was helpless in the clutches of the brute blood of their air, and her helplessness is signified by the 'loosening of her thighs', which is an expression rich in overtones of sexuality. In this way, an immortal god mated with a mortal girl. The event proved a fateful one as it set in motion a whole chain of events. The girl gave birth to Helen and the result was the Trojan War and the burning of the roof and 'topless' towers of Troy. She also gave birth to Clytemnestra and the result was the tragedy of Agamemnon. Clytemnestra was the queen of Agamemnon but she got so angry with him that she with the help of his children killed her own husband."

In this poem, the speaker describes the situation that makes one leave their dear country, home, and belongings. When the big shark-like countrymen hunt down others, bloodthirsty and ferocious, there is no other way out than to flee one's country. The boy once the speaker made love with, holds a gun bigger than his body, waiting for her or his family. Thus, there is only one option left for the speaker: running. Throughout this poem, the narrator describes horrific events that refugees have to endure on their journey out. For instance, women are sexually exploited by men of their father's age. On top of that, they are sexually exploited by the prison guard. Reiterating the statement, “no one leaves home” or “no one chooses refugee camps” (or such a life), the narrator wants to portray the helplessness of the refugees worldwide. "

The poem takes the reader through various ways in which the reader can rise above adversity that will almost certainly be thrown one's way at some point. Throughout the poem, the speaker gives the reader multiple scenarios, both positive and negative, along with a glimpse into how one should conduct oneself. The poem has an almost mathematical proof about it with its if-then scenario. Kipling leaves the “then” until the final two lines, revealing to the reader that if he or she is able to do all that was just mentioned, he or she will not only have the world at his or her fingertips, but he or she will also be a “Man.”"

This piece presents a set of images in each stanza. The first stanza begins with two sets of images. Simic depicts how the grandmothers wring the necks of chickens and old nuns pull the naughty schoolboys by the ear. Even a pickpocket's intricate movement captures his attention. He connects these daily acts to the art of dancing in the final stanza of the poem.

The poem begins with the speaker directing their words to a specific listener, someone who has passed away. The speaker and their family members did not know that this person was going to die that day or “that God was going to call your name.” But, the speaker explains how everyone on Earth loves this deceased person in the same way they did when they were alive. As the poem progresses, the speaker describes how everyone is devastated that this person has died, but they did not go to Heaven alone. Memories and love went with them, and one day they will all be reunited in Heaven at God's side."

The poem starts with a surprising comparison between a fork and a strange thing that's crawled “right out of hell.” It's creature-like, specifically like the foot of a bird. The fork-creature also looks like something that might be worn as a trophy around a cannibal's neck. As the poem continues, the speaker crafts an even stronger image of “you” using the work and one's fist becoming the beakless, blind head of a bird."

Up to the Moon is cast—

And closes from behind.

When the Mariner's trance is abated.'

As in a gentle weather:
'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high;
The dead men stood together.

All stood together on the deck,
For a charnel-dungeon fitter:
All fixed on me their stony eyes,
That in the Moon did glitter.

The pang, the curse, with which they died,
Had never passed away:
I could not draw my eyes from theirs,
Nor turn them up to pray.

And now this spell was snapt: once more
I viewed the ocean green,
And looked far forth, yet little saw
Of what had else been seen—

Like one, that on a lonesome road
Doth walk in fear and dread,
And having once turned round walks on,
And turns no more his head;
Because he knows, a frightful fiend
Doth close behind him tread.

But soon there breathed a wind on me,
Nor sound nor motion made:
Its path was not upon the sea,
In ripple or in shade.

It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek
Like a meadow-gale of spring—
It mingled strangely with my fears,
Yet it felt like a welcoming.

Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,
Yet she sailed softly too:
Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze—
On me alone it blew.

Is this mine own countree?

So smoothly it was strewn!
And on the bay the moonlight lay,
And the shadow of the Moon.

The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,

The moonlight steeped in silentness
The steady weathercock.

And the bay was white with silent light,
Till rising from the same,
Full many shapes, that shadows were,
In crimson colours came.

A little distance from the prow
Those crimson shadows were:
I turned my eyes upon the deck—
Oh, Christ! what saw I there!

Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,
And, by the holy rood!

Each one a lovely light;

Like music on my heart.

The Mariner wakes up beside the dead sailors and the ship moves steadily onward, eventually arriving at the Mariner's home. There, he weeps and prays that he isn't dreaming. He sees the angels leave the bodies of the dead soldiers and hears silent music. Finally, he sees a small boat with several people in it. He hopes the Hermit will be able to absolve him of his sin of killing the albatross."

The stanzas of this poem take the reader through a series of images that depict outwardly the inner emotional turmoil that Mariana is experiencing. Her emotions are transmuted onto the larger setting. The speaker describes a dark and abandoned farmhouse that is falling apart. It is in desperate need of repair but no one is there to tend to it. Just as Mariana's mind is slipping away from light, happiness, and hope for the future, so too are her surroundings. Towards the middle of the poem, a very important image shows itself, a poplar tree. It is the only thing to be seen on the flat and featureless landscape that surrounds the farmhouse. This tree, which stands upright in an otherwise flat field, is often interpreted as a phallic symbol. This is emphasized by the poplar tree's shadow that falls across Mariana's bed at night. The speaker does not reach a conclusion about Mariana's future nor does Mariana make any kind of transition away from mourning her lover. Rather, the poem continues to reiterate these dark symbols and emotions. It concludes with Mariana stating that she has become “dreary“."

I recall two windows and a cosmic peace
Of bare brown rooms and on whitewashed walls
Photographs of the passionate and pale Pearse.

I recall wet thatch and peeling jambs
And how all was best seen from below in the field;
I used to sit in the rushes with ledger-book and pencil
Compiling poems of passion for Cáit Killann.


Often she used linger on the sill of a window;
Hands by her side and brown legs akimbo;
In sun-red skirt and moon-black blazer;
Looking toward our strange world wide-eyed.

Our world was strange because it had no future;
She was America-bound at summer's end.
She had no choice but to leave her home -
The girl with the keys to Pearse's Cottage.

This poem takes the reader through a series of images that are described through a dog's eyes. He sees lamp posts as trees with moons and ascribes importance and unimportance to different things that a human might. He's willing to eat the cow or the policeman but would prefer the former. The dog follows his nose, understands the things that are larger than himself and smaller. He knows reality and sees it as his existence allows him to. In the middle of the poem, Ferlinghetti introduces politics and a discussion about free will through reference to a specific congressman that the dog is disturbed by. He isn't afraid of this person, as he knows the truth about his own nature, but he is bothered. Towards the end of the poem the language becomes more complex, the margins disappear and Ferlinghetti introduces themes of free will, God, religion, politics, and the meaning of life."
401,401,401,"With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children,
England mourns for her dead across the sea.
Flesh of her flesh they were, spirit of her spirit,
Fallen in the cause of the free.

Solemn the drums thrill; Death august and royal 
Sings sorrow up into immortal spheres,
There is music in the midst of desolation
And a glory that shines upon our tears.

They went with songs to the battle, they were young,
Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow.
They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted;
They fell with their faces to the foe.

They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old: 
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.
At the going down of the sun and in the morning
We will remember them.

They mingle not with their laughing comrades again; 
They sit no more at familiar tables of home;
They have no lot in our labour of the day-time;
They sleep beyond England's foam.

But where our desires are and our hopes profound, 
Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight,
To the innermost heart of their own land they are known
As the stars are known to the Night;

As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust, 
Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain;
As the stars that are starry in the time of our darkness, 
To the end, to the end, they remain.","England mourns for her dead across the sea. Flesh of her flesh they were,","'For the Fallen' by Laurence Binyon addresses the loss of lives in World War I and how they will live on forever in the stars. In the first lines of 'For the Fallen,' the speaker begins by personifying England. He depicts the country as a mother to all her citizens. She thanks them for the services they've given to her. She “mourns her dead across the sea.” They are lost to her shores, but she recognizes the sacrifice they've made. It soon becomes clear that they were fighting for freedom, specifically in the First World War. Despite how terrible these losses are, there is still music. It celebrates their bravery. The following stanzas depict what the soldiers were like who marched into battle. They were sharp, young, loyal, filled with patriotic duty, and firm in their stance against the enemy. They knew their chances of surviving the war were slim, but they fought on and faced down death until it took them. The speaker discusses how things have changed drastically for these men. They are never going to return home to their families and sit around the table again. They've been put to rest far from their native land. But, they will live on in their family member's memories and in the hearts of all those who benefit from their service. They will shine in the sky as eternal stars, outlasting those who did not die in the war."
402,402,402,"For me, the naked and the nude
(By lexicographers construed
As synonyms that should express
The same deficiency of dress
Or shelter) stand as wide apart
As love from lies, or truth from art.

Lovers without reproach will gaze
On bodies naked and ablaze;
The Hippocratic eye will see
In nakedness, anatomy;
And naked shines the Goddess when
She mounts her lion among men.

The nude are bold, the nude are sly
To hold each treasonable eye.
While draping by a showman's trick
Their dishabille in rhetoric,
They grin a mock-religious grin
Of scorn at those of naked skin.

The naked, therefore, who compete
Against the nude may know defeat;
Yet when they both together tread
The briary pastures of the dead,
By Gorgons with long whips pursued,
How naked go the sometimes nude!","The naked and the nude stand as wide apart As love from lies, or truth from art","The Naked and the Nude' by Robert Graves is a clever and complicated poem that depicts the difference, or lack thereof, between nakedness and nudity. The speaker addresses the two ways of being as wholly different from one another. They are as estranged as lies and love and art and truth. The poet uses several examples to describe how these two things are different, as seen through the eyes of doctors, lovers, and art. But, by the end of the poem, he comes to the conclusion that in reality they really aren't so different. Whether one is naked or nude the afterlife is always waiting."

Throughout interesting images that focus on the transformation of a landscape, the poet creates a semi-surrealistic, dreamlike narrative. It ends with the image of blind sailors on a boat at sea for many years. The poem leaves readers without any answers to their questions and will likely create a variety of impressions."
404,404,404,"Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?

Thou art more lovely and more temperate:

Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,

And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,

And often is his gold complexion dimmed,

And every fair from fair sometime declines,

By chance, or nature’s changing course untrimmed:

But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,

Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,

When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st,

 So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,

 So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.",'Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? Thou art,"The poem opens with the speaker putting forward a simple question: can he compare his lover to a summer’s day? Historically, the theme of summertime has always been used to evoke a certain amount of beauty, particularly in poetry. Summer has always been seen as the respite from the long, bitter winter, a growing period where the earth flourishes itself with flowers and with animals once more. Thus, to compare his lover to a summer’s day, the speaker considers their beloved to be tantamount to a rebirth, and even better than summer itself. As summer is occasionally short, too hot, and rough, summer is, in fact, not the height of beauty for this particular speaker. Instead, he attributes that quality to his beloved, whose beauty will never fade, even when ‘death brag thou waander’stin his shade‘, as he will immortalize his lover’s beauty in his verse."

With smell of steaks in passageways.
Six o’clock.
The burnt-out ends of smoky days.
And now a gusty shower wraps
The grimy scraps
Of withered leaves about your feet
And newspapers from vacant lots;
The showers beat
On broken blinds and chimney-pots,
And at the corner of the street
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.

And then the lighting of the lamps.


The morning comes to consciousness
Of faint stale smells of beer
From the sawdust-trampled street
With all its muddy feet that press
To early coffee-stands.

With the other masquerades
That time resumes,
One thinks of all the hands
That are raising dingy shades
In a thousand furnished rooms.


You tossed a blanket from the bed,
You lay upon your back, and waited;
You dozed, and watched the night revealing
The thousand sordid images
Of which your soul was constituted;
They flickered against the ceiling.
And when all the world came back
And the light crept up between the shutters
And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,
You had such a vision of the street
As the street hardly understands;
Sitting along the bed’s edge, where
You curled the papers from your hair,
Or clasped the yellow soles of feet
In the palms of both soiled hands.


His soul stretched tight across the skies
That fade behind a city block,
Or trampled by insistent feet
At four and five and six o’clock;
And short square fingers stuffing pipes,
And evening newspapers, and eyes
Assured of certain certainties,
The conscience of a blackened street
Impatient to assume the world.

I am moved by fancies that are curled
Around these images, and cling:
The notion of some infinitely gentle
Infinitely suffering thing.

Eliot contains a complex imagistic narrative on the dark and depressing nature of city life and the state of the human soul. The poem begins with the speaker describing a city just entering into the night. He pays close attention to the smell of steak in the air and the fact that there is a lot of grime on the ground. There are newspapers and many other miscellaneous pieces of trash. All of these blow around “your” feet. The first section ends with all the indoor lamps turning on. When the poem resumes in the second section it is morning again and the city is regaining consciousness. There is a smell of beer on the air and everyone is pulling up their dirty blinds, unhappy to face another day that is exactly like the last. The third section depicts “your” particular experience. This person had a night filled with sordid dreams straight from the soul. When “you” finally get up, it takes some time but “you” eventually make it back into “your” life. The last lines give the reader a little bit of hope that maybe the timeless, miserable way of living will not go on forever. "

In the first lines, the speaker, who a reader may assume is Bluebeard himself, addresses his wife. He speaks calmly but with a clear disappointment and solemnity. His wife went into the one place in the entire castle that he asked her not to. Now, in his irritation and disappointment, he shows her around the empty room, thus proving to her that there's nothing to fear. Unlike the original story, the room is empty. It doesn't contain the heads of his previous wives. She betrayed him for nothing. He calls her action greedy. She took the one thing from him he wanted to keep for himself. The poem concludes with Bluebeard telling the wife that she can have the whole “place”. He's going to find somewhere else that he can live without the threat of betrayal and the invasion of his personal physical and mental space. "

'To a Friend' by Amy Lowell, the poetic persona asks her friend only one thing, “always you will be my dream of you”. The line says it all. The poet adores the bond friendship much more than anything else in her life. She believes it is hard to find a friend and to keep the friendship is harder enough. In this world, it is not easy to find a person who can understand one's true self. If the poet finds one, she never wants to befriend that person. She knows, “The world is full of rude awakenings” but she also believes in “beauty through all wrongs”. It is the beauty of friendship which makes her life lyrical as a song."

The poem begins with the speaker setting the scene. He is on a beach and his feet are just touching the water. Night has fallen around him and the only light that remains is that which comes from the moon. He seems to be at a point of convergence where the wind, sea, and moon are all present. The main characters of the poem surface from the depths of the sea, they are white, pure, flowers. These flowers are representations of the speaker's unspoken words and unrealized dreams. The flowers exist no matter what humankind does to the planet, and will be there long after all human beings are gone."

'The Émigrée' by Carol Rumens is a poem about a child who emigrated to a new city. The child's feelings and realization after coming into a new culture and linguistic environment, form the basis of the poem. Moreover, the “sunlight” clear memory of her native place, presents how much she adored her old city. Apart from that, there is a constant conflict in her heart regarding the new city. She can't speak the language properly. However, the past seems to hold her back and resist her from getting into the new journey. At last, she strongly claims her cultural identity as if the shadow behind her in the daylight, is nothing but her old identity. Along with that, the sunlight reminds her of the value of her culture that is going to be washed away in near future."

Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair,
And the green freedom of a cockatoo
Upon a rug mingle to dissipate
The holy hush of ancient sacrifice.
She dreams a little, and she feels the dark
Encroachment of that old catastrophe,
As a calm darkens among water-lights.
The pungent oranges and bright, green wings
Seem things in some procession of the dead,
Winding across wide water, without sound.
The day is like wide water, without sound,
Stilled for the passing of her dreaming feet
Over the seas, to silent Palestine,
Dominion of the blood and sepulchre.


Why should she give her bounty to the dead?
What is divinity if it can come
Only in silent shadows and in dreams?
Shall she not find in comforts of the sun,
In pungent fruit and bright, green wings, or else
In any balm or beauty of the earth,
Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven?
Divinity must live within herself:
Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow;
Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued
Elations when the forest blooms; gusty
Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights;
All pleasures and all pains, remembering
The bough of summer and the winter branch.
These are the measures destined for her soul.


Jove in the clouds had his inhuman birth.
No mother suckled him, no sweet land gave
Large-mannered motions to his mythy mind.
He moved among us, as a muttering king,
Magnificent, would move among his hinds,
Until our blood, commingling, virginal,
With heaven, brought such requital to desire
The very hinds discerned it, in a star.
Shall our blood fail? Or shall it come to be
The blood of paradise? And shall the earth
Seem all of paradise that we shall know?
The sky will be much friendlier then than now,
A part of labor and a part of pain,
And next in glory to enduring love,
Not this dividing and indifferent blue.


She says, “I am content when wakened birds,
Before they fly, test the reality
Of misty fields, by their sweet questionings;
But when the birds are gone, and their warm fields
Return no more, where, then, is paradise?”
There is not any haunt of prophecy,
Nor any old chimera of the grave,
Neither the golden underground, nor isle
Melodious, where spirits gat them home,
Nor visionary south, nor cloudy palm
Remote on heaven’s hill, that has endured
As April’s green endures; or will endure
Like her remembrance of awakened birds,
Or her desire for June and evening, tipped
By the consummation of the swallow’s wings.


She says, “But in contentment I still feel
The need of some imperishable bliss.”
Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her,
Alone, shall come fulfilment to our dreams
And our desires. Although she strews the leaves
Of sure obliteration on our paths,
The path sick sorrow took, the many paths
Where triumph rang its brassy phrase, or love
Whispered a little out of tenderness,
She makes the willow shiver in the sun
For maidens who were wont to sit and gaze
Upon the grass, relinquished to their feet.
She causes boys to pile new plums and pears
On disregarded plate. The maidens taste
And stray impassioned in the littering leaves.


Is there no change of death in paradise?
Does ripe fruit never fall? Or do the boughs
Hang always heavy in that perfect sky,
Unchanging, yet so like our perishing earth,
With rivers like our own that seek for seas
They never find, the same receding shores
That never touch with inarticulate pang?
Why set the pear upon those river-banks
Or spice the shores with odors of the plum?
Alas, that they should wear our colors there,
The silken weavings of our afternoons,
And pick the strings of our insipid lutes!
Death is the mother of beauty, mystical,
Within whose burning bosom we devise
Our earthly mothers waiting, sleeplessly.


Supple and turbulent, a ring of men
Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn
Their boisterous devotion to the sun,
Not as a god, but as a god might be,
Naked among them, like a savage source.
Their chant shall be a chant of paradise,
Out of their blood, returning to the sky;
And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice,
The windy lake wherein their lord delights,
The trees, like serafin, and echoing hills,
That choir among themselves long afterward.
They shall know well the heavenly fellowship
Of men that perish and of summer morn.
And whence they came and whither they shall go
The dew upon their feet shall manifest.


She hears, upon that water without sound,
A voice that cries, “The tomb in Palestine
Is not the porch of spirits lingering.
It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay.”
We live in an old chaos of the sun,
Or old dependency of day and night,
Or island solitude, unsponsored, free,
Of that wide water, inescapable.
Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quail
Whistle about us their spontaneous cries;
Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness;
And, in the isolation of the sky,
At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make
Ambiguous undulations as they sink,
Downward to darkness, on extended wings.","The shiver of the sun, the shiver of the birds, the s","'Sunday Morning' by Wallace Stevens discusses the nature of the afterlife and the role of God and nature in the creation of paradise. The poem begins with the speaker describing a woman spending her Sunday morning sitting outside rather than going to church. She falls into a dream that makes her feel guilty about the death of Christ. The dream includes a journey to Palestine and Christ's tomb. Although she feels something, she is still skeptical about religion. She isn't ready to give up her life and all its pleasures to the Christian god. In the next stanza, the speaker compares Christ to the Greek and Roman god Jove. Jove is different because he only represents the sun, rather than actually being it. The speaker wonders over the desire of humans to create religion and whether or not paradise can exist. The next section returns to the perspective of the woman who is described as finding peace in the sight of birds waking, walking around, and taking off for a day of the flight. She believes that beauty is something to be loved and Death to be feared. The speaker pushes back against this opinion stating that beauty cannot exist without Death. In an effort to illustrate his point he describes the actions of pagan men who worship the sun because of its influence on the land rather than what powers it might wield as a god. The men are not burdened by the expectations of the Christian god, or any all-seeing, commanding power. They simply exist in the world, similar to how nature will exist in the final stanza. The last stanza contains another portion of the woman's dream of Christ's tomb. This time the vision is speaking to her and describing the tomb as nothing more than a burial place. It is not home to spirits. In conclusion, the speaker goes over everything he previously stated and ends with a wish to know nature without looking through a human lens."

'A Bard's Epitaph' by Robert Burns talks about the poet's imaginary grave in the first stanza. It draws the attention of the people who throng around it at times. Moreover, the lines written in the poet's grave remind of his contribution to Scottish literary tradition. There is a wise person who stands by the grave of the poet. Even the person drops a tear to see the “whim-inspired fool” who once pleased people with his rusting songs. Whereas in the last two stanzas, the poet talks about his mindless follies that stained his “name”. At last, the poet requests the readers to learn from his life. One should know that prudence, alertness, and self-control are the three ingredients that make one wise in life."

She nurses her baby and remembers what it was like to be in labor and feel her child being born but not having her in the world yet. As her child was born, it was like letting go of a loved one about to embark on a long ship voyage, she writes. It's sorrowful but something that one has to accept. Now, time has passed, and her body has healed. But, this only seems to inspire the speaker to retell stories of her child's birth with more urgency, trying to recapture what the experience was like."

Each like a corpse within its grave, until
Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow

Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill
(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)
With living hues and odours plain and hill:

Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;
Destroyer and preserver; hear, oh hear!

II
Thou on whose stream, mid the steep sky's commotion,
Loose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed,
Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,

Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread
On the blue surface of thine aëry surge,
Like the bright hair uplifted from the head

Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge
Of the horizon to the zenith's height,
The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge

Of the dying year, to which this closing night
Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre,
Vaulted with all thy congregated might

Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere
Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: oh hear!

III
Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams
The blue Mediterranean, where he lay,
Lull'd by the coil of his crystalline streams,

Beside a pumice isle in Baiae's bay,
And saw in sleep old palaces and towers
Quivering within the wave's intenser day,

All overgrown with azure moss and flowers
So sweet, the sense faints picturing them! Thou
For whose path the Atlantic's level powers

Cleave themselves into chasms, while far below
The sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear
The sapless foliage of the ocean, know

Thy voice, and suddenly grow gray with fear,
And tremble and despoil themselves: oh hear!

IV
If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;
If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;
A wave to pant beneath thy power, and share

The impulse of thy strength, only less free
Than thou, O uncontrollable! If even
I were as in my boyhood, and could be

The comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven,
As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speed
Scarce seem'd a vision; I would ne'er have striven

As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.
Oh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!
I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!

A heavy weight of hours has chain'd and bow'd
One too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.

V
Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is:
What if my leaves are falling like its own!
The tumult of thy mighty harmonies

Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone,
Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,
My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!

Drive my dead thoughts over the universe
Like wither'd leaves to quicken a new birth!
And, by the incantation of this verse,

Scatter, as from an unextinguish'd hearth
Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!
Be through my lips to unawaken'd earth

The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,
If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?","O wind, thou breath of autumn's being, Thou, from whose","'Ode to the West Wind' by Percy Bysshe Shelley focuses on the west wind, a powerful and destructive force, yet a necessary one. In the first lines, the speaker addresses the wind and describes how it creates deadly storms. it drives away the summer and brings with it the cold and darkness of winter. He imagines what it would be like to be a dead leaf lifted and blown around by the wind and he implores the wind to lift him “as a wave, a lead, a cloud!” The speaker sees the wind as a necessary evil, one that eventually means that spring is on the way."

This confusion pairs well with the odd inquiries posed by the “son,” as well as the odd responses of the “father,” and the mixture of bizarre proves to be a perfect circumstance to mirror the theme of ‘You Are Old, Father William’. That theme involves generation gaps—specifically how different generations can fail to understand one another."

Even knowing this invasion, humanity has proceeded to destroy the world, leaking waves of pollution into the atmosphere all while social inequality is rampant. Thomas moves through these ideas, looking at war and bombings as his first point of contention. Thomas follows this by looking at the factors that underline societal values, 'acumen', and a 'carnivorous' nature that places money and the economy as more important than human life. Further destroying the land, humanity has allowed 'deadly smoke' to pool over 'icecaps', global warming caused by relentless progress without caution. Especially considering the close links with the word 'inauguration' and the American political system, combined with the focus on 'bull markets' (the New York Stock Exchange quite literally featuring a symbolic representation of this 'bull' on Wall Street), it is justified to suggest this poem is directed at American society."

In the second stanza, the speaker refers to her beloved. She is “spectacularly bored” in this relationship. For this reason, she does not hide her feelings. She asks him to leave. Lastly, she humorously asks him whether he can return when she screams to have him back."

The poem begins with the speaker outlining how it would feel to look at Medusa if one was able to without turning to stone. He interprets her thoughts through her shadowed gaze as being those of anguish and death. As the poem continues the speaker describes how the snakes move on her head and their skins shed, transforming them endlessly throughout time. Medusa is on a rock in the water, looking down at the smaller creatures below her. It is their mistake, coming within range of her gaze, that allows the snakes to gleam their “brazen glare.”"

This does not impede her from talking around “it.” Whatever happened to her occurred in May, in days she now recalls fondly, and with a deep longing. She loved this time period for how it sat on the edge of life. Death was so far off the month seemed without end. In the last lines, the speaker reiterates what she conveyed in the first three. She also states that now that the event is in the past, she feels cold. This is a distinct change from the warmth of the sun in the previous lines."

Where God has built his blazing throne,
Nor yet alone in earth below,

Eternal wisdom still the same!

Flows murmuring through its hidden caves,

Fired with a new and livelier blush,
While all their burden of decay
The ebbing current steals away,

Forever quivering o’er his task,

Along its hollow glassy threads!

The poem begins with the speaker describing how one could look to heaven, the earth, and within the human body and still not come to a full understanding of God's power. He speaks of the “wondrous frame” of humankind and the “Eternal wisdom” of God that lives inside it. In the next stanza he goes on to describes how humanity is intrinsically linked to the natural world. The blowing of the winds and the flowing of the rivers bring in and out life and death. They lead to and from the human heart and the “flame” that is God's power. The speaker moves on to reference a “slave” who is toiling over a body of water. The mundanity of the scene is interrupted by a “crimson jet” overhead, reminding one that God's will and power are always at play. In the final stanzas, the speaker draws the reader's attention to the sights and sounds of earth and how wonderful they are to the human ear and eye. The poem concludes with a plea for all of humanity and it's construction. The speaker hopes that God will take the dust that is left behind after death and bring it to Heaven from where it originated."

And the great arras-hangings, made Of various faces, by are laid; That, for all furniture, you’ll find Only your picture in my mind.
Here thou are painted in the dress
Of an inhuman murderess; Examining upon our hearts Thy fertile shop of cruel arts: Engines more keen than ever yet Adorned a tyrant’s cabinet;
Of which the most tormenting are
Black eyes, red lips, and curlèd hair.
But, on the other side, th’art drawn Like to Aurora in the dawn;
When in the East she slumbering lies, And stretches out her milky thighs; While all the morning choir does sing, And manna falls, and roses spring; And, at thy feet, the wooing doves Sit pérfecting their harmless loves.
Like an enchantress here thou show’st, Vexing thy restless lover’s ghost; And, by a light obscure, dost rave Over his entrails, in the cave; Divining thence, with horrid care, How long thou shalt continue fair;
And (when informed) them throw’st away,
To be the greedy vulture’s prey.
But, against that, thou sit’st afloat Like Venus in her pearly boat.

Nor blows more wind than what may well Convoy the perfume to the smell.

This gallery is filled only with images of his true love, and he hopes that she will be impressed by it. The first painting that he shows off is that of Clora as a “murderess” using her looks to charm those around her. The second shows her as Aurora the goddess of the dawn. These two contrasting images depict the intensive spot that she holds in the speaker's heart. She is both a controlling and appealing woman. This is expanded on as the speaker shows the reader a portrait of Clora as Venus, as well as an “enchantress” who is telling the future from her lover's entrails. The poem concludes with the speaker saying that these are only a few of the thousands of paintings he has and that of all of them, the original is his favorite. He most cherishes an image of his love shows her as she was when he first saw her, simple, and kind."

In this poem, Rumi expresses his antithetical ideas and how he wants his loved ones to react after he passes away. He has a positive attitude throughout the poem, though he talks about his death. The poem contains many symbols that explain the speaker's thoughts on death. It is considered that death is nothing but an “arriving at eternal love.” For the speaker, death is a doorway to heaven and eternal life waiting behind the thin veil of oblivion. It helps one to be the closest with God. Besides, the poem reflects Islamic concepts and beliefs of eternal life. According to the speaker, death appears to be like a “sunset,” but actually, it is the “dawn.”"

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is observing a beautiful day. The landscape around him contains both the sea and mountains and he is able to take in both. He observes everything, listening to its voice which sounds like “Solitude's.” In the next section, he looks deeper into the sea and sees the bottom of the deep. It is untouched by any human presence. Once more the elements of the scene come together and show off the true beauty of the landscape. He is there at a pristine moment in time. The next sections go into the emotional state of the narrator. He is not enlivened by the sights he sees. Instead, he meditates on his own depression. He lists all the things he does not have but wishes he did. This has led him into a dark place in his mind he cannot get out of. He feels as if the world does not care for him— he is a man alone. The final section sees the speaker attempt to improve his own mood by enjoying the moment he is living in. He understands how time passes and that this moment, if not enjoyed will go to waste just like all the others he took for granted."

427,427,427,"There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around
That the colt from Old Regret had got away,
And had joined the wild bush horses - he was worth a thousand pound,
So all the cracks had gathered to the fray.
All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far
Had mustered at the homestead overnight,
For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are,
And the stock-horse snuffs the battle with delight.
There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup,
The old man with his hair as white as snow;
But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up —
He would go wherever horse and man could go.
And Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand,
No better horseman ever held the reins;
For never horse could throw him while the saddle girths would stand,
He learnt to ride while droving on the plains.
And one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast;
He was something like a racehorse undersized,
With a touch of Timor pony — three parts thoroughbred at least —
And such as are by mountain horsemen prized.
He was hard and tough and wiry — just the sort that won't say die —
There was courage in his quick impatient tread;
And he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye,
And the proud and lofty carriage of his head.
But still so slight and weedy, one would doubt his power to stay,
And the old man said, ""That horse will never do
For a long and tiring gallop - lad, you'd better stop away,
Those hills are far too rough for such as you.""
So he waited sad and wistful — only Clancy stood his friend —
""I think we ought to let him come,"" he said;
""I warrant he'll be with us when he's wanted at the end,
For both his horse and he are mountain bred.""
""He hails from Snowy River, up by Kosciusko's side,
Where the hills are twice as steep and twice as rough,
Where a horse's hoofs strike firelight from the flint stones every stride,
The man that holds his own is good enough.
And the Snowy River riders on the mountains make their home,
Where the river runs those giant hills between;
I have seen full many horsemen since I first commenced to roam,
But nowhere yet such horsemen have I seen.""
So he went; they found the horses by the big mimosa clump,
They raced away towards the mountain's brow,
And the old man gave his orders, ""Boys, go at them from the jump,
No use to try for fancy riding now.
And, Clancy, you must wheel them, try and wheel them to the right.
Ride boldly, lad, and never fear the spills,
For never yet was rider that could keep the mob in sight,
If once they gain the shelter of those hills.""
So Clancy rode to wheel them — he was racing on the wing
Where the best and boldest riders take their place,
And he raced his stockhorse past them, and he made the ranges ring
With the stockwhip, as he met them face to face.
Then they halted for a moment, while he swung the dreaded lash,
But they saw their well-loved mountain full in view,
And they charged beneath the stockwhip with a sharp and sudden dash,
And off into the mountain scrub they flew.
Then fast the horsemen followed, where the gorges deep and black
Resounded to the thunder of their tread,
And the stockwhips woke the echoes, and they fiercely answered back
From cliffs and crags that beetled overhead.
And upward, ever upward, the wild horses held their way,
Where Mountain Ash and Kurrajong grew wide;
And the old man muttered fiercely, ""We may bid the mob good day,
No man can hold them down the other side.""
When they reached the mountain's summit, even Clancy took a pull -
It well might make the boldest hold their breath;
The wild hop scrub grew thickly, and the hidden ground was full
Of wombat holes, and any slip was death.
But the man from Snowy River let the pony have his head,
And he swung his stockwhip round and gave a cheer,
And he raced him down the mountain like a torrent down its bed,
While the others stood and watched in very fear.
He sent the flint-stones flying, but the pony kept his feet,
He cleared the fallen timbers in his stride,
And the man from Snowy River never shifted in his seat —
It was grand to see that mountain horseman ride.
Through the stringy barks and saplings, on the rough and broken ground,
Down the hillside at a racing pace he went;
And he never drew the bridle till he landed safe and sound,
At the bottom of that terrible descent.
He was right among the horses as they climbed the farther hill
And the watchers on the mountain standing mute,
Saw him ply the stockwhip fiercely; he was right among them still,
As he raced across the clearing in pursuit.
Then they lost him for a moment, where two mountain gullies met
In the ranges - but a final glimpse reveals
On a dim and distant hillside the wild horses racing yet,
With the man from Snowy River at their heels.
And he ran them single-handed till their sides were white with foam.
He followed like a bloodhound on their track,
Till they halted cowed and beaten, then he turned their heads for home,
And alone and unassisted brought them back.
But his hardy mountain pony he could scarcely raise a trot,
He was blood from hip to shoulder from the spur;
But his pluck was still undaunted, and his courage fiery hot,
For never yet was mountain horse a cur.
And down by Kosciusko, where the pine-clad ridges raise
Their torn and rugged battlements on high,
Where the air is clear as crystal, and the white stars fairly blaze
At midnight in the cold and frosty sky,
And where around the Overflow the reed -beds sweep and sway
To the breezes, and the rolling plains are wide,
The man from Snowy River is a household word today,
And the stockmen tell the story of his ride.","The horseman from Snowy River is a household word today, and the stockmen tell","'The Man from Snowy River' by Banjo Paterson is a Bush Ballad, that tells the story of a young man who single-handedly pursues a prizewinning colt and brings back the mob of wild horses. 'The Man from Snowy River,' tells the story of a prizewinning racehorse that escapes from its paddock and lives with the wild horses. Following this, a number of horsemen go on a pursuit to bring back the colt. Unexpectedly, the brumbies descend a seemingly impassable steep slope. Even though other riders give up the pursuit, a young protagonist, the man from the snowy river goes down the “terrible descent” to recapture the colt on his “pony”. Without minding the danger that he catches the mob and brings back the horse and becomes the legend among the people of the country."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that whenever he wakes up, no matter how beautiful the day, or promising the engagements, he is unhappy. There is a “dark spot” inside his soul which cannot be filled by anyone— other than the woman he loves. She is transforming his life bit by bit. By this point, he has become overwhelmed by his love. It is bordering on obsession. He speaks on how he used to care about his own “fame.” This used to be the goal of the path he was walking on. That has completely changed at this point though. She has taken him over. In the final stanza, he speaks on how his life is passing him by and that the woman he loves is the only one who can break the spell he is under. Until they come together he will live with the “dark spot” inside his heart and soul."

She puts,"Red Roses by Anne Sexton is a story of child abuse told by a narrator, but with the vernacular, that represents the emotions and thoughts of the child undergoing the abuse. The word choice and imagery is so contrary to the negative phrasing a reader might expect in a story of a toddler being abused that the atmosphere of the work feels like a juxtaposition. This juxtaposition, as it happens, is one of the primary strengths of the work because it showcases the struggle of a child who loves his mother and wants to stay with her, but needs to make the situation right enough in his own mind to keep going with that love. Little Tommy, the toddler, wants to believe that things are well with his mother, though he seems to know better on a deeper level, and that concept is a driving force in the work—to the point that Sexton’s poem is sincerely haunting and heart-breaking."

The poem begins with the speaker describing how she is the only one still awake in the house. The “sire” and the “dame” are asleep. They cannot see what she's doing and even if they did, she'd reveal nothing about her intentions. There is someone she's waiting for and her lamp, that she tends assiduously, is there in the window guiding this person in. By the end of the poem it becomes clear that this visitor is nonhuman. He has a “Strange Power” and the ability to command her allegiance. He holds all the power in the relationship and she is determined to be true to him and keep his identity a secret from everyone. This is what's going to maintain their relationship. Although the full poem is quoted below, you can also read the poem here."

The poem is simple, with only eight lines it outlines quickly and clearly the first time the two met, the relationship they thought they had, and how that turned out not to be the case. Whoever the speaker and listener are, they did not truly know one another. It becomes clear that they had misunderstood who the other person was and built their relationship on false pretenses."

Auden is about the power of grief and the way that it influences people differently. For someone like the speaker who has suffered a loss, the world is transformed. But to everyone else, nothing changes. Time doesn't slow down, and no one cares what's happening. The indifference of the world plagues the speaker in this poem. They plead with the world to feel as they do, understand his grief, and even participate in it."

Her “summer house” which she imagines, is a place in which she and her lover were going to be happy. This place of carefree happiness is being sealed up, windows covered and the view gone. Their time has dwindled like the sand in an hourglass. The speaker remembers how fanciful and free her thoughts used to be and that now they have retreated to the back of her head. She speaks of the nature of their relationship and how there is no way to predict what the two of them are becoming and that they are akin to white whales, gone far out in the ocean. The speaker continues on to describe her own consciousness as a beachcomber searching through her memories for something worthwhile while seagulls circle above. The poem concludes with a reality check in which she states permanent facts about the world, repeating them to herself, forcing herself to acknowledge reality and leave behind her fantasy world."

The poem begins with the speaker asking that no matter what happens the love between himself and another is never be lost. He wants to be able to relish his lover's eyes and breath on his “cheek” every night. The speaker is worried about losing what he has because he imagines himself as a tree without adornments on a solitary shore. This is not how he wants to live the rest of his life. In the last two stanzas, the speaker directs his words to his lover. This person has become so important to him that they have taken on the role of “master.” He is a “dog,” following and indulging his lover's every desire."

The speaker starts the poem by asserting that their spirit isn't strong enough; they are weighed down by the inevitability of death. SO much so, it feels as though they are about to fall asleep at any time. They look at the states of godlike hardship, and they know that they are going to lose their life one day. The speaker makes other comparisons, suggesting that they are like an eagle that is too sick to fly, but that gazes at the sky. They also say that these thoughts make the speaker hone in on the struggle in their heart. This is compared to the way that the Elgin Marbles make the speaker feel awestruck and in pain. They are filled with both beauty and suffering. They make the speaker, he concludes, think of the sea and sun, but at the same time, they are shadows of something else entirely."

Throughout the short lines of 'The Wild Iris,' the speaker describes what it means to live, die, and be reborn again. They've gone through the cycle an endless number of times as a flower. It is a struggle that has a door at the end, a light at the end of the tunnel. They are well-versed in what it is like to be buried alive and exist without a voice and then rediscover that voice as one bends the earth. While the speaker is talking about a flower, there are obvious implications for humanity, and the human soul. It is also possible to read this poem as a depiction of a mental or emotional rebirth rather than a physical one."

She asks objects such as ‘flowers’, a ‘spider’ and even her own ‘body’ to stay, but in the end they always leave or change. The final stanza of the poem focuses on asking lovers to stay, to which they answer ‘always’. This ending can be interpreted both positivity, in that they stay with her, or as a lie – a broken promise repeated lover after lover."

The poem begins with the speaker describing the lead up to Christmas and how everything in a church is decorated for Advent. These images start the poem on a cozy and familiar note. The speaker's tone is calm and peaceful, he is simply taking in the Christmas imagery. Time progresses, and the speaker moves on to examine the village itself. There are a number of buildings which are also decorated with “paper” and buntings that read “Merry Christmas to you all.” The next lines move the poem into London. There, the speaker takes note of the shops which are also decorated. They are adorned with “silver bells and flowers. This contrasts somewhat with the simple decorations of the village. In the fifth stanza, he goes through a few of the people who are called to the church on Christmas Eve. They all come, even those who live in the “Dorchester Hotel.” Stanzas six and seven contain questions. They are used to seek out the truth of the Christian Christmas story, regarding the birth of Christ in a manger. It is clear from the speaker's tone that he is already a believer, he is just using the questions as a place to start off this last section of the poem. Throughout stanzas seven and eight he compares the things that people do on Christmas, such as giving bad gifts and spending time with family to what he thinks really matters. That is the birth of Christ and giving proper time and appreciation to the story."

The poem beings with the speaker stating that he does not have the amount, or type, of love that he desires. He wants to be loved without reserve or stipulation. He believes that if he can acquire the love of one particular unnamed person, that he will be without fear. The evil of the world will be unable to reach him. The speaker describes how all the pain that exists, whether within or without, could not touch him. He would be impervious to hurt of any kind. Love would provide him with an indestructible hope that would rise past any depression or darkness. The poem concludes with the speaker describing how even if the world was to completely come to an end, and alone with her he faced his death, he would not be afraid. As long as they have their hands clasped and are able to reassure one another with their presence, they could face an oncoming torrent of destruction. Unfortunately for the speaker, this is only a dream. From this piece, the reader cannot infer whether there is any possibility of this love becoming real."

It is an old poetic form, with roots in a religious ritual. The Book of Lamentations, for example, is one of the books of the Old Testament. In Irish, there are several great lamentations, such as “Lament for Owen Roe O'Neill,” “The Hag of Beare,” and “Lament for Art O'Leary.” The rhyme scheme of Lament for Thomas MacDonagh is Xaba bcXc Xbab and the meter is iambic tetrameter. The last word of the first line in each stanza rhymes with the middle word of the second line of each stanza: 1) cry/sky, 2) blows/snows, and 3) moor/poor. In stanzas two and three, Ledwidge repeats this pattern with the third and fourth lines: cup/upset, morn/horn. Ledwidge makes use of “eye rhyme,” in the poem, a form of writing where two words look as though they should rhyme, even though they do not. An example is “cow” and “low” in stanza three. In the first stanza “sweeter birds” contains elements of the word “bittern” (bi-, -ter) and the false rhymes of “wailing” and “rain.”"

The young speaker describes a failed effort to escape from the boarding school. It starts with the children jumping on a train and briefly riding it. They look outside and admire the landscape, noting how scarred and changed it is. When they get to a stopping point, the sheriff picks them up and returns them. This is something, the speaker alludes, that has happened before and will likely happen again. Back at the school, they do “shameful” work and consider their ancestors. Despite what they've suffered, there is still hope in their hearts, keeping them strong."

Rife with Christian imagery, and pulling much inspiration from apocalyptic writing, Yeats’ ‘The Second Coming’ tries to put into words what countless people of the time felt: that it was the end of the world as they knew it and that nothing else would ever be the same again. The First World War had shaken the foundations of knowledge for many, and scarred from the knowledge of the ‘war to end all wars’, they could no longer reconcile themselves with a time before the Great War.

Trees can sway or be still. Day or night can be what they wish.
What we desire, more than a season or weather, is the comfort
Of being strangers, at least to ourselves. This is the crux
Of the matter, which is why even now we seem to be waiting
For something whose appearance would be its vanishing—
The sound, say, of a few leaves falling, or just one leaf,
Or less. There is no end to what we can learn. The book out there
Tells us as much, and was never written with us in mind.","To stare at nothing is to learn by heart What all of us will be swept into,","'The Night, the Porch' by Mark Strand is a thoughtful and complex poem that discusses the nature of human existence and nature. The poem starts with contemplation of “nothing” and humanity's interaction with the natural world. As it progresses, the language gets more complicated. The speaker discusses how “us,” meaning humanity, want to see ourselves as strangers. This element of mystery is expanded as they discuss how the world was not “written with us in mind.”"

The poem begins with the speaker describing sex as something that is both an irritant and a constant. There is no escaping it. One is forced to endure it in cycles and as frustration grows, a “bubble” appears. This bubble represents the rapid way in which emotions can change, as well as their delicate nature. The speaker goes on to describe how the bubble grows around himself and his listener. Together they become enclosed in it. Trapped with one another in a strange prison of love and lust. The only thing they can do is give in to their “Bestial” intent. In the next lines, he states that whenever he has sex, it always seems as if it is leading somewhere great, but that's never the case. He always ends up disappointed and looking at a “sad scape,” or poor emotional landscape. His bad memories of the encounters only last so long. Then he is ready to throw off the “irritant” once more. The poem concludes with the speaker thinking about a bright, bare room that has been burnt clean and emptied by the sun. This place contrasts with the dark “ashen hills” of the previous stanza. It is to this “padlocked” room the speaker would like to travel. Unfortunately for him, and for all of humanity represented by his plight, there is no way into this utopia."

In fourteen hundred ninety-two
Columbus sailed the ocean blue.
He had three ships and left from Spain;
He sailed through sunshine, wind and rain.
He sailed by night; he sailed by day;
He used the stars to find his way.
A compass also helped him know
How to find the way to go.
Ninety sailors were on board;
Some men worked while others snored.
Then the workers went to sleep;
And others watched the ocean deep.
Day after day they looked for land;
They dreamed of trees and rocks and sand.
October 12 their dream came true,
You never saw a happier crew!
""Indians! Indians!"" Columbus cried;
His heart was filled with joyful pride.
But ""India"" the land was not;
It was the Bahamas, and it was hot.
The Arakawa natives were very nice;
They gave the sailors food and spice.
Columbus sailed on to find some gold
To bring back home, as he'd been told.
He made the trip again and again,
Trading gold to bring to Spain.
The first American? No, not quite.
But Columbus was brave, and he was bright.

In the poem 'The Camel's Hump,' Kipling draws similarities between lazy humans and a camel. The camel's hump has been taken into a negative light, calling it “uglier” to sight. Its hump is seen as a metaphor for being inactive and sluggish. Doing nothing is a sheer waste of time and energy. According to the poet, the person who sits back doing nothing productive is unpleasant to the sight, just like the “Cameelious hump.” The poet thus conveys the message to be active, involved in things, be innovative, and never stop to make oneself better and the best."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that the woman is “a mighty monarch's child”. This references a higher being, perhaps God, a king, or the power of the natural world, which one cannot control. They are together under a tree, in a natural setting. The speaker held “The maiden” to their “panting breast.” In the second stanza, the speaker tells the woman that he intends to “have” her, but doesn't want any part of the woman's father's kingdom. He does not want to be king, have land, or wear a crown. The poem concludes with the woman having her say. She tells her partner that this is impossible. The only time they can be together is when she breaks through “the sod.” Here it becomes clear how Holden is using the flower to symbolize the temporary, yet strong nature of their love. The woman blooms, and then dies. In fact, she states that she is already dead, emphasizing the impossibility of their relationship."

In the first lines of this poem, the speaker describes his nearly empty surroundings and how the wallpaper rises in his mind like the bars of a jail cell. These bars prevent him from being able to write, despite the piece of paper in front of him. They come from deep internal loneliness. The speaker dearly misses his daughter, who, the poem suggests, is now too old to spend time around him."

A brackish reach of shoal off Madaket—
The sea was still breaking violently and night Had steamed into our North Atlantic Fleet,
When the drowned sailor clutched the drag-net. Light Flashed from his matted head and marble feet, He grappled at the net
With the coiled, hurdling muscles of his thighs:
The corpse was bloodless, a botch of reds and whites, Its open, staring eyes
Were lustreless dead-lights
Or cabin-windows on a stranded hulk Heavy with sand. We weight the body, close Its eyes and heave it seaward whence it came, Where the heel-headed dogfish barks its nose On Ahab’s void and forehead; and the name Is blocked in yellow chalk.
Sailors, who pitch this portent at the sea Where dreadnaughts shall confess
Its hell-bent deity,
When you are powerless
To sand-bag this Atlantic bulwark, faced
By the earth-shaker, green, unwearied, chaste In his steel scales: ask for no Orphean lute
To pluck life back. The guns of the steeled fleet Recoil and then repeat
The hoarse salute.

Whenever winds are moving and their breath Heaves at the roped-in bulwarks of this pier, The terns and sea-gulls tremble at your death In these home waters. Sailor, can you hear The Pequod’s sea wings, beating landward, fall Headlong and break on our Atlantic wall Off ’Sconset, where the yawing S-boats splash The bellbuoy, with ballooning spinnakers, As the entangled, screeching mainsheet clears The blocks: off Madaket, where lubbers lash The heavy surf and throw their long lead squids For blue-fish? Sea-gulls blink their heavy lids Seaward. The winds’ wings beat upon the stones, Cousin, and scream for you and the claws rush At the sea’s throat and wring it in the slush Of this old Quaker graveyard where the bones Cry out in the long night for the hurt beast Bobbing by Ahab’s whaleboats in the East.

All you recovered from Poseidon died
With you, my cousin, and the harrowed brine Is fruitless on the blue beard of the god, Stretching beyond us to the castles in Spain, Nantucket’s westward haven. To Cape Cod Guns, cradled on the tide,
Blast the eelgrass about a waterclock
Of bilge and backwash, roil the salt and sand Lashing earth’s scaffold, rock
Our warships in the hand
Of the great God, where time’s contrition blues Whatever it was these Quaker sailors lost
In the mad scramble of their lives. They died When time was open-eyed,
Wooden and childish; only bones abide
There, in the nowhere, where their boats were tossed Sky-high, where mariners had fabled news Of IS, the whited monster. What it cost Them is their secret. In the sperm-whale’s slick I see the Quakers drown and hear their cry: “If God himself had not been on our side, If God himself had not been on our side, When the Atlantic rose against us, why, Then it had swallowed us up quick.”

This is the end of the whaleroad and the whale
Who spewed Nantucket bones on the thrashed swell And stirred the troubled waters to whirlpools To send the Pequod packing off to hell: This is the end of them, three-quarters fools, Snatching at straws to sail
Seaward and seaward on the turntail whale, Spouting out blood and water as it rolls, Sick as a dog to these Atlantic shoals:
Clamavimus, O depths. Let the sea-gulls wail
For water, for the deep where the high tide Mutters to its hurt self, mutters and ebbs. Waves wallow in their wash, go out and out, Leave only the death-rattle of the crabs, The beach increasing, its enormous snout Sucking the ocean’s side.
This is the end of running on the waves;
We are poured out like water. Who will dance
The mast-lashed master of Leviathans
Up from this field of Quakers in their unstoned graves?

When the whale’s viscera go and the roll Of its corruption overruns this world
Beyond tree-swept Nantucket and Woods Hole And Martha’s Vineyard, Sailor, will your sword Whistle and fall and sink into the fat?
In the great ash-pit of Jehoshaphat
The bones cry for the blood of the white whale, The fat flukes arch and whack about its ears, The death-lance churns into the sanctuary, tears The gun-blue swingle, heaving like a flail,
And hacks the coiling life out: it works and drags And rips the sperm-whale’s midriff into rags, Gobbets of blubber spill to wind and weather, Sailor, and gulls go round the stoven timbers Where the morning stars sing out together
And thunder shakes the white surf and dismembers The red flag hammered in the mast-head. Hide Our steel, Jonas Messias, in Thy side.

OUR LADY OF WALSINGHAM
There once the penitents took off their shoes And then walked barefoot the remaining mile; And the small trees, a stream and hedgerows file Slowly along the munching English lane, Like cows to the old shrine, until you lose Track of your dragging pain.
The stream flows down under the druid tree, Shiloah’s whirlpools gurgle and make glad The castle of God. Sailor, you were glad And whistled Sion by that stream. But see:
Our Lady, too small for her canopy,
Sits near the altar. There’s no comeliness At all or charm in that expressionless
Face with its heavy eyelids. As before,
This face, for centuries a memory,
Non est species, neque decor,
Expressionless, expresses God: it goes
Past castled Sion. She knows what God knows, Not Calvary’s Cross nor crib at Bethlehem Now, and the world shall come to Walsingham.

Throughout the seven sections of the poem, the poet depicts the power of the ocean and humanity's inability to exert any kind of control over it. This is seen through the life and death of Ahab's crew, the explosion at sea of a special naval vessel in the first lines, as well as the various images of the waves and wind, scattered throughout the lines. The poet also brings in images of a graveyard that acts as a memorial site for many of the men who died at sea. There are numerous allusions to God and religion throughout.

The first three stanzas follow this format, each year Koch's appreciation for the city he has arrived into changing, focusing on features of a different season and emotions in each stanza. It seems that it is within the third year of being in this new city that Koch finds a partner. Yet, while incredibly passionate, depicted through the metaphor of a lit match, their relationship eventually burns out. His partner ignites him, while he seems to slow them down with him 'somnambular' way of life. Although they were together for a 'year', it seems that they were not right for each other, eventually separating. Yet, the emotions and memories they shared live on, the final line revealing the innate connection between the past lovers."

In the first lines of this poem, the speaker, who is commonly considered to be Yeats himself, begins by describing a young girl. He's unwilling to turn himself towards the world's politics, engage with them, and ignore this symbolic woman. He discusses a man, a politician, and what it would be like to be young again.

Rather than fighting it, the speaker alludes, one should enter into it like a bird or a flower, with the “folding of the wings.” He speaks to “you” in the second half of the poem, encouraging “you” to take into consideration everything he's said and offering to light this listener's way into the next life."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that “they” are returning. The gods are tentative in their steps as if they are unsure how to proceed. They sway and have trouble walking. It is immediately clear they do not have some strength they used to. This is only emphasized in the next lines as the speaker remembers what they, and their “silver hounds” used to be like. They had a strength that was unmatched and a ferocity to be feared. 'The Return' concludes with the gods remaining in their “pallid” and sick form.

De la Mare paints the impression of the parting words a person will ever speak, “Goodbye.” His persona compares the void these words create by comparing it to the “last dismantled flower” in a weed-grown fence or noise so faint that it is barely audible. The speaker then describes the emptiness that remains after these words are spoken, like darkness hovering over the haunted eyes or candles burning out into nothingness. The feeling of obscurity is evident throughout the poem. In the end, de la Mare describes how the person's absence wreaks havoc in his mind by the line, “Toss on in vain the whispering trees of Eden.” Overall, he creates an intricate image of the emotional toll the last words of a person take and the silence and emptiness that follows after their abrupt departure."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that “Love” has left her and in it's wake is the inescapable sameness of the days. She no longer knows how to live her life and must force herself to eat and start her day. As soon as she is awake she is ready for night to fall, but when she finally gets in bed, she is unable to sleep. This pattern is repeating itself over and over. In the second stanza the speaker states how she no longer knows what she is supposed to do everyday, and that anything she does attempt to do, she gets bored of quickly. She feels as if there is no point to finishing anything she starts. Finally, the narrator describes how her neighbors are spying on her and hoping to find out what happened in her life. She feels a deep depression about the state of the world she is living in. She does not want to have to deal with “to-morrow and to-morrow.”"

It is unclear at first if there is a point to his travels or if he is just moving aimlessly through the landscape. He takes note of the moon, which is only half-full. This provides him with just enough light to see the land in the distance. It is not enough for him to make out any distinct features. This does not bother the speaker—making it likely he has taken this trip before. Thereafter, he makes it to land and is welcomed by the “slushy sand” in which he leaves his boat. He makes his way across fields until a farmhouse is visible in the distance. Upon reaching its window he taps on the glass and is rewarded with the spark of a match and the voice of his lover. The two can meet in secret in the final line."
461,461,461,"The calm, Cool face of the river
Asked me for a kiss."," The calm, cool face of the river Asked me for a kiss.</s","'Suicide's Note' by Langston Hughes is a short emotional poem that speaks very simply and peacefully on life, suicide, and death. The poem begins with the speaker using two short words to describe the atmosphere, “The calm.” This phrase speaks to the atmosphere the speaker experienced and that in the poem itself. The speaker describes how he stood before a river and looked down into its waters. 'Suicide's Note' concludes with the river's “Cool face,” asking the speaker “for a kiss.” It is unclear whether or not he accepted, but considering the title, he most likely did."
462,462,462,"Thou brightly-glittering star of even,
Thou gem upon the brow of Heaven
Oh! were this fluttering spirit free,
How quick 't would spread its wings to thee.

How calmly, brightly dost thou shine,
Like the pure lamp in Virtue's shrine!
Sure the fair world which thou may'st boast
Was never ransomed, never lost.

There, beings pure as Heaven's own air,
Their hopes, their joys together share;
While hovering angels touch the string,
And seraphs spread the sheltering wing.

There cloudless days and brilliant nights,
Illumed by Heaven's refulgent lights;
There seasons, years, unnoticed roll,
And unregretted by the soul.

Thou little sparkling star of even,
Thou gem upon an azure Heaven,
How swiftly will I soar to thee,
When this imprisoned soul is free!","''Thou brightly-glittering star of even, Thou gem","‘To a Star‘ by Lucretia Maria Davidson is a simple, impassioned poem that speaks about the nature of Heaven and the stars in the sky. 

The speaker of ‘To a Star’ spends the poem gazing into the night sky considering the place of the star on the brow of heaven. She imagines what it’s like to be in heaven, how time passes as well as how the angels play music and create shelter. The star resides in a place that she would very much, if her soul were free, like to be. She determines at the end of the poem that she’s going to head straight there when she can."
463,463,463,"The rain set early in to-night,
The sullen wind was soon awake,
It tore the elm-tops down for spite,
And did its worst to vex the lake:
I listened with heart fit to break.
When glided in Porphyria; straight
She shut the cold out and the storm,
And kneeled and made the cheerless grate
Blaze up, and all the cottage warm;
Which done, she rose, and from her form
Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl,
And laid her soiled gloves by, untied
Her hat and let the damp hair fall,
And, last, she sat down by my side
And called me. When no voice replied,
She put my arm about her waist,
And made her smooth white shoulder bare,
And all her yellow hair displaced,
And, stooping, made my cheek lie there,
And spread, o'er all, her yellow hair,
Murmuring how she loved me — she
Too weak, for all her heart's endeavour,
To set its struggling passion free
From pride, and vainer ties dissever,
And give herself to me for ever.
But passion sometimes would prevail,
Nor could to-night's gay feast restrain
A sudden thought of one so pale
For love of her, and all in vain:
So, she was come through wind and rain.
Be sure I looked up at her eyes
Happy and proud; at last I knew
Porphyria worshipped me; surprise
Made my heart swell, and still it grew
While I debated what to do.
That moment she was mine, mine, fair,
Perfectly pure and good: I found
A thing to do, and all her hair
In one long yellow string I wound
Three times her little throat around,
And strangled her. No pain felt she;
I am quite sure she felt no pain.
As a shut bud that holds a bee,
I warily oped her lids: again
Laughed the blue eyes without a stain.
And I untightened next the tress
About her neck; her cheek once more
Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss:
I propped her head up as before,
Only, this time my shoulder bore
Her head, which droops upon it still:
The smiling rosy little head,
So glad it has its utmost will,
That all it scorned at once is fled,
And I, its love, am gained instead!
Porphyria's love: she guessed not how
Her darling one wish would be heard.
And thus we sit together now,
And all night long we have not stirred,
And yet God has not said a word!",Porphyria's love: she guessed not how her darling one wish,"Robert Browning’s poem, ‘Porphyria’s Lover,’ opens up with a classic setting. It’s a stormy evening. The rain and the wind are harsh. The speaker is alone in a small cottage. Suddenly, a woman enters, bringing cheer and warmth in the midst of the dark and cold night. It seems like a classic love poem, but when the tone shifts and the speaker does the unthinkable, it leaves the reader questioning everything from the authority of the speaker to the reality of his descriptions. The woman’s voice is not heard, and the reader is forced to draw conclusions from the voice of a speaker who proves to be less than trustworthy."
464,464,464,"The bears are kept by hundreds within fences, are fed cracked
Eggs; the weakest are
Slaughtered and fed to the others after being scented
With the blood of deer brought to the pastures by Elizabeth’s
Men—the blood spills from deep pails with bottoms of slate.

The balding Queen had bear gardens in London and in the country.
The bear is baited: the nostrils
Are blown full with pepper, the Irish wolf dogs
Are starved, then, emptied, made crazy with fermented barley:

And the bear’s hind leg is chained to a stake, the bear
Is blinded and whipped, kneeling in his own blood and slaver, he is
Almost instantly worried by the dogs. At the very moment that
Elizabeth took Essex’s head, a giant brown bear
Stood in the gardens with dogs hanging from his fur. . .
He took away the sun, took
A wolfhound in his mouth, and tossed it into
The white lap of Elizabeth I—arrows and staves rained

On his chest, and standing, he, then, stood even taller, seeing
Into the Queen’s private boxes—he grinned
Into her battered eggshell face.
Another volley of arrows and poles, and opening his mouth
He showered
Blood all over Elizabeth and her Privy Council.

The very next evening, a cool evening, the Queen demanded
Thirteen bears and the justice of 113 dogs: she slept

All that Sunday night and much of the next morning.
Some said she was guilty of this and that.
The Protestant Queen gave the defeated bear
A grave in a Catholic cemetery. The marker said:
Peter, a Solstice Bear, a gift of the Tsarevitch to Elizabeth.

After a long winter she had the grave opened. The bear’s skeleton
Was cleared with lye, she placed it at her bedside,
Put a candle inside behind the sockets of the eyes, and, then
She spoke to it:

You were a Christmas bear—behind your eyes
I see the walls of a snow cave where you are a cub still smelling
Of your mother’s blood which has dried in your hair; you have
Troubled a Queen who was afraid
When seated in shade which, standing,
You had created! A Queen who often wakes with a dream
Of you at night—
Now, you’ll stand by my bed in your long white bones; alone, you
Will frighten away at night all visions of bear, and all day
You will be in this cold room—your constant grin,
You’ll stand in the long, white prodigy of your bones, and you are,

Every inch of you, a terrible vision, not bear, but virgin!",The balding Queen had bear gardens in London and in the country. The bear is bait,"'Elizabeth's War with the Christmas Bear' by Norman Dubie is an interesting and memorable poem about how Queen Elizabeth I survived an attack by a bear. The poem opens with a description of the horrible conditions the bear and dogs endured. Both were tormented and baited, ensuring they were violent. At one point, one of the bears, later named Peter (a gift from the Russian royal family), turns on the Queen and starts to make moves towards her box. The bear is shot down, and the Queen honors it with a burial. She later digs it up, has its bones bleached, and keeps it by her bed with candles in its eyes. It reminds her of herself in the end."

When he might captured the victor's cup.

In the first stanzas of this poem, the speaker admits that things are going to seem “low” at points in one's life. One might want to be happy but also have to deal with negative circumstances out of their control. On these occasions, he says, “rest if you must, but don't you quit.” As the lines progress, the speaker includes several vague descriptions of people who have struggled, quit without knowing how close they were to success. The poem ends on the same note in which it began, inspiring readers to stick through the fight even when “you're hardest hit.”"
467,467,467,"There it was I saw what I shall never forget
And never retrieve.
Monstrous and beautiful to human eyes, hard to
believe,
He lay, yet there he lay,
Asleep on the moss, his head on his polished cleft
small ebony hoves,
The child of the doe, the dappled child of the deer.

Surely his mother had never said, ""Lie here
Till I return,"" so spotty and plain to see
On the green moss lay he.
His eyes had opened; he considered me.

I would have given more than I care to say
To thrifty ears, might I have had him for my friend
One moment only of that forest day:


Might I have had the acceptance, not the love
Of those clear eyes;
Might I have been for him in the bough above
Or the root beneath his forest bed,
A part of the forest, seen without surprise.

Was it alarm, or was it the wind of my fear lest he
depart
That jerked him to his jointy knees,
And sent him crashing off, leaping and stumbling
On his new legs, between the stems of the white
trees?",I saw what I shall never forget And never retrieve. Monstrous and beautiful to human eyes,"'The Fawn' by Edna St. Vincent Millay tells of an encounter between a deer and a speaker who wants nothing more than to be accepted by the forest. The poem begins with the speaker vaguely describing an encounter she had with a deer. The importance of the memory is clear from the beginning. It is something she doesn't expect to ever happen again and this gives the tone a distinct sadness. In the next lines, she describes what it was like to come upon the deer. She was surprised to see him there, by himself in the moss. His mother was not around and she wondered why this is the case. In the last two stanzas, the speaker conveys her desire to be accepted by the deer and allowed to exist alongside him. She doesn't want to be loved, she just wants to be a part of the ecosystem. The poem concludes with a long question. The deer suddenly becomes alarmed and runs from the speaker. She is bothered by this turn of events because she can't figure out what she did wrong."

Merwin is a short, haunting poem in which the poet describes what darkness is and how it relates to his mother's losses. In the first lines of this poem, the poet describes blueberries at night, the taste of the experience, and what he learned from his mother. She told him directly that he's not “afraid of the dark.” Instead, he learned over time, people are afraid of deeper, all-consuming loss such as that which his mother experienced throughout her life. She lost almost all the important people in her life, defining for the poet what there truly is to fear. She knew that the dark wasn't what one should be afraid of."

In the first lines, the speaker begins by describing the sky as ink-filled. The dark clouds gathered and people began running for cover. Despite this fact, he feels a connection to the rain throughout his whole body. At the end of the text, this connection becomes spiritual. He speaks on his notebook, the impact of the rain on the storefronts, and its ability to cleanse one’s mind and body."

his voice was lost in the din

He picked on a boy who was shouting
and throttled him then and there
then garrotted the girl behind him
(the one with grotty hair)

Then sword in hand he hacked his way
between the chattering rows
'First come, first severed' he declared
'fingers, feet or toes'

He threw the sword at a latecomer
it struck with deadly aim
then pulling out a shotgun
he continued with his game

In the first lines of the poem, the teacher walks into the classroom to a familiar sight – his students not listening to him and creating a great deal of noise. He tells them that it's time to learn a lesson. Over the following stanzas, he brings out multiple weapons, killing everyone in his classroom. At one point, the “Head” looks into the classroom to see what's going on and nods understandably. The poem ends with the teacher telling his now quiet classroom that this is the “lesson” that they needed to learn."

Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.

And you O my soul where you stand,
Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,
Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,
Till the bridge you will need be form’d, till the ductile anchor hold,
Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.","A noiseless patient spider, I mark’d where on a little promontory it","A Noiseless Patient Spider” explores the relationship between the individual self and the larger world. The poem depicts a spider that is isolated in space but actively sending filaments ""out of itself,"" seeking connection as it builds its web. This spider becomes an extended metaphor for the speaker’s soul, which is likewise isolated and working to find a sense of connection. Ultimately, the poem suggests that in spite of the loneliness people might experience as individuals, the work of the soul is to constantly seek and make connections—however daunting such a task may be."

Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone

Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
And on the pedestal, these words appear:
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”","I met a traveller from an ancient land, Who said—“Two vast","'Ozymandias' by P. B. Shelley describes a traveler's reaction to the half-buried, worn-out statue of the great pharaoh, Ramses II. In this poem, the speaker describes meeting a traveler “from an antique land.” The title, 'Ozymandias,' notifies the reader that this land is most probably Egypt since Ozymandias was what the Greeks called Ramses II. He was a great and terrible pharaoh in ancient Egypt. The traveler tells a story to the speaker. In the story, he describes visiting Egypt. There, he saw a large and intimidating statue of Ramses in the desert. He can tell that the sculptor must have known his subject well because it is obvious from the statue's face that this man was a great leader, but one who could also be very vicious. He describes his sneer as having a “cold command.” Even though the leader was probably very great, it seems that the only thing that survives from his realm is this statue, which is half-buried and somewhat falling apart."

too wet to go out
and too cold to play ball.
so we sat in the house.
we did nothing at all.

so all we could do was to
sit!
sit!

and we did not like it.
not one little bit.

and then something went BUMP!
how that bump made us jump!
we looked!
then we saw him step in on the mat!

'why do you sit there like that?'
'i know it is wet
and the sun is not sunny.
but we can have
lots of good fun that is funny!'

'i know some good games we could play,'
said the cat.
'i know some new tricks,'
said the cat in the hat.
'a lot of good tricks.
i will show them to you.

he came down with a bump
from up there on the ball.

and our fish came down, too.
he fell into a pot!
he said, 'do i like this?
oh, no! i do not.

'no, i do not like it,
not one little bit!'

'now look what you did!'
said the fish to the cat.
'now look at this house!
look at this! look at that!
you sank our toy ship,
sank it deep in the cake.

and you bent our new rake.

i do NOT wish to go!

'so
so
so...
i will show you

and then he ran out.
and, then, fast as a fox,
the cat in the hat
came back in with a box.
a big red wood box.
it was shut with a hook.
'now look at this trick,'
said the cat.
'take a look!'

then he got up on top
with a tip of his hat.
'i call this game fun-in-a-box,'
said the cat.
'in this box are two things
i will show to you now.
you will like these two things,'
said the cat with a bow.

'i will pick up the hook.
you will see something new.
two things. and i call them
Thing One and Thing Two.
these Things will not bite you.
they want to have fun.'
then, out of the box
came Thing Two and Thing One!
and they ran to us fast.
they said, 'how do you do?
would you like to shake hands
with Thing One and Thing Two?'

and sally and i
did not know what to do.
so we had to shake hands
with Thing One and Thing Two.
we shook their two hands.
but our fish said, 'no! no!
those Things should not be
in this house! make them go!
they should not be here
when your mother is not!
put them out! put them out!'
said the fish in the pot.

'have no fear, little fish,'
said the cat in the hat.
'these Things are good Things.'
and he gave them a pat.
'they are tame. oh, so tame!
they have come here to play.
they will give you some fun
on this wet, wet, wet day.'

now, here is a game that they like,'
said the cat.
'they like to fly kites,'
said the cat in the hat.

'no! not in the house!'
said the fish in the pot.
'they should not fly kites
in a house! they should not.
oh, the things they will bump!
oh, the things they will hit!
oh, i do not like it!
not one little bit!'

then sally and i
saw them run down the hall.
we saw those two Things
bump their kites on the wall!
bump! thump! thump! bump!
down the wall in the hall.

thing two and thing one!
they ran up! they ran down!
on the string of one kite
we saw mother's new gown!
her gown with the dots
that are pink, white and red.
then we saw one kite bump
on the head of her bed!

then those things ran about
with big bumps, jumps and kicks
and with hops and big thumps
and all kinds of bad tricks.
and i said,
'i do NOT like the way that they play!
if mother could see this,
oh, what would she say!'

then our fish said, 'look! look!'
and our fish shook with fear.
'your mother is on her way home!
do you hear?
oh, what will she do to us?
what will she say?
oh, she will not like it
to find us this way!'

'so DO something! fast!' said the fish.
'do you hear!
i saw her. your mother!
your mother is near!
so, as fast as you can,
think of something to do!
you will have to get rid of
thing one and thing two!'

so, as fast as i could,
i went after my net.
and i said, 'with my net
i can get them i bet.
i bet, with my net,
i can get those things yet!'

then i let down my net.
it came down with a PLOP!
and i had them! at last!
those two things had to stop.
then i said to the cat,
'now you do as i say.
you pack up those Things
and you take them away!'

'oh dear!' said the cat.
'you did not like our game...
oh dear.
what a shame!
what a shame!
what a shame!'

then he shut up the things
in the box with the hook.
and the cat went away
with a sad kind of look.

'that is good,' said the fish.
'he has gone away. yes.
but your mother will come.
she will find this big mess!
and this mess is so big
and so deep and so tall,
we can not pick it up.
there is no way at all!'

and THEN!
who was back in the house?
why, the cat!
'have no fear of this mess,'
said the cat in the hat.
'i always pick up all my playthings
and so...
i will show you another
good trick that i know!'

then we saw him pick up all the things that were down.
he picked up the cake,
and the rake, and the gown,
and the milk, and the strings,
and the books, and the dish,
and the fan, and the cup,
and the ship, and the fish.
and he put them away.
then he said, 'that is that.'
and then he was gone
with a tip of his hat.

then our mother came in
and she said to us two,
'did you have any fun?
tell me. what did you do?'

and sally and i did not know
what to say.
should we tell her
the things that went on there that day?

should we tell her about it?
now, what SHOULD we do?
well...
what would YOU do
if your mother asked YOU?",i wish we had something to do. i wish we had something to do.,"The Cat in the Hat' by Dr. Seuss is a light-hearted children's book that describes the antics of the cat in the hat. The story takes place in a short period of time, starting out with the cat barging into Sally and her brother's home and showing off his balancing skills. As the fish predicted, the cat falls, making a huge mess of everything he was holding. As if to remedy the problem, he brings in Thing One and Thing Two, who only make the mess worse. Finally, in the end, the cat comes back with his huge cleaning machine and gets everything sorted right before the children's mother gets home. "
476,476,476,"I guess you think you know this story.
You don't. The real one's much more gory.
The phoney one, the one you know,
Was cooked up years and years ago,
And made to sound all soft and sappy
just to keep the children happy.
Mind you, they got the first bit right,
The bit where, in the dead of night,
The Ugly Sisters, jewels and all,
Departed for the Palace Ball,
While darling little Cinderella
Was locked up in a slimy cellar,
Where rats who wanted things to eat,
Began to nibble at her feet.

She bellowed 'Help!' and 'Let me out!
The Magic Fairy heard her shout.
Appearing in a blaze of light,
She said: 'My dear, are you all right?'
'All right?' cried Cindy .'Can't you see
'I feel as rotten as can be!'
She beat her fist against the wall,
And shouted, 'Get me to the Ball!
'There is a Disco at the Palace!
'The rest have gone and I am jealous!
'I want a dress! I want a coach!
'And earrings and a diamond brooch!
'And silver slippers, two of those!
'And lovely nylon panty hose!
'Done up like that I'll guarantee
'The handsome Prince will fall for me!'
The Fairy said, 'Hang on a tick.'
She gave her wand a mighty flick
And quickly, in no time at all,
Cindy was at the Palace Ball!

It made the Ugly Sisters wince
To see her dancing with the Prince.
She held him very tight and pressed
herself against his manly chest.
The Prince himself was turned to pulp,
All he could do was gasp and gulp.
Then midnight struck. She shouted,'Heck!
I've got to run to save my neck!'
The Prince cried, 'No! Alas! Alack!'
He grabbed her dress to hold her back.
As Cindy shouted, 'Let me go!'
The dress was ripped from head to toe.

She ran out in her underwear,
And lost one slipper on the stair.
The Prince was on it like a dart,
He pressed it to his pounding heart,
'The girl this slipper fits,' he cried,
'Tomorrow morn shall be my bride!
I'll visit every house in town
'Until I've tracked the maiden down!'
Then rather carelessly, I fear,
He placed it on a crate of beer.

At once, one of the Ugly Sisters,
(The one whose face was blotched with blisters)
Sneaked up and grabbed the dainty shoe,
And quickly flushed it down the loo.
Then in its place she calmly put
The slipper from her own left foot.
Ah ha, you see, the plot grows thicker,
And Cindy's luck starts looking sicker.

Next day, the Prince went charging down
To knock on all the doors in town.
In every house, the tension grew.
Who was the owner of the shoe?
The shoe was long and very wide.
(A normal foot got lost inside.)
Also it smelled a wee bit icky.
(The owner's feet were hot and sticky.)
Thousands of eager people came
To try it on, but all in vain.
Now came the Ugly Sisters' go.
One tried it on. The Prince screamed, 'No!'
But she screamed, 'Yes! It fits! Whoopee!
'So now you've got to marry me!'
The Prince went white from ear to ear.
He muttered, 'Let me out of here.'
'Oh no you don't! You made a vow!
'There's no way you can back out now!'
'Off with her head!'The Prince roared back.
They chopped it off with one big whack.
This pleased the Prince. He smiled and said,
'She's prettier without her head.'
Then up came Sister Number Two,
Who yelled, 'Now I will try the shoe!'
'Try this instead!' the Prince yelled back.
He swung his trusty sword and smack
Her head went crashing to the ground.
It bounced a bit and rolled around.
In the kitchen, peeling spuds,
Cinderella heard the thuds
Of bouncing heads upon the floor,
And poked her own head round the door.
'What's all the racket? 'Cindy cried.
'Mind your own bizz,' the Prince replied.
Poor Cindy's heart was torn to shreds.
My Prince! she thought. He chops off heads!
How could I marry anyone
Who does that sort of thing for fun?

The Prince cried, 'Who's this dirty slut?
'Off with her nut! Off with her nut!'
Just then, all in a blaze of light,
The Magic Fairy hove in sight,
Her Magic Wand went swoosh and swish!
'Cindy! 'she cried, 'come make a wish!
'Wish anything and have no doubt
'That I will make it come about!'
Cindy answered, 'Oh kind Fairy,
'This time I shall be more wary.
'No more Princes, no more money.
'I have had my taste of honey.
I'm wishing for a decent man.
'They're hard to find. D'you think you can?'
Within a minute, Cinderella
Was married to a lovely feller,
A simple jam maker by trade,
Who sold good home-made marmalade.
Their house was filled with smiles and laughter
And they were happy ever after.",Cinderella's fairy tale was a tale of a young girl who was locke,"Cinderella' by Roald Dahl retells the story of Cinderella and how rather than marrying the Prince, she ends up with a lovely man who makes jam. The poem begins with the speaker stating that the story which is about to follow is not the one the reader might expect. It is the true story of Cinderella, unedited. In the following stanzas, Cinderella makes her way to the ball via help from a Fairy. She meets the Prince and loses her dress and her shoe. Rather than try to fit their feet into the shoe, the ugly sisters flush it down the toilet and replace it with one of their own. When the Prince sees that the shoe fits the first ugly sister he beheads her and then proceeds to do the same to the other sister. Cinderella is turned off by the idea of a man who beheads people and wishes to be married to a “lovely feller.” Immediately her wish is granted and she lives happily ever after."

The poet has employed irony in the poem as he talks of the Death of Lincoln. 'Hush'd Be the Camps To-Day' by Walt Whitman reveals his intentions of writing a poem in memory of Abraham Lincoln. The poet begins by requesting the camps to be quiet in honor of their lost commander. He wants the soldiers to retire and drape the weapons, as the war is done. Despite the sorrow that was befallen by the death of Abraham Lincoln, he brings in a positive note when he says that his commander has no worries about victory or defeat. Further, he states that he doesn't have to worry about the dark times of the war. Considering all these he wants 'the poet' (a soldier or an appeal to himself) to sing a song as they slide down the body of Lincoln to bury. He prefers a soldier from the camp to sing a song, for he knows Lincoln better than anyone."
478,478,478,"HOW wisely Nature did decree,
With the same eyes to weep and see ;
That, having viewed the object vain,
They might be ready to complain !
And, since the self-deluding sight
In a false angle takes each height,
These tears, which better measure all,
Like watery lines and plummets fall.
Two tears, which sorrow long did weigh
Within the scales of either eye,
And then paid out in equal poise,
Are the true price of all my joys.
What in the world most fair appears,
Yea, even laughter, turns to tears ;
And all the jewels which we prize
Melt in these pendants of the eyes.
I have through every garden been,
Amongst the red, the white, the green,
And yet from all the flowers I saw,
No honey, but these tears could draw.
So the all-seeing sun each day
Distils the world with chymic ray ;
But finds the essence only showers,
Which straight in pity back he pours.
Yet happy they whom grief doth bless,
That weep the more, and see the less ;
And, to preserve their sight more true,
Bathe still their eyes in their own dew.
So Magdalen in tears more wise
Dissolved those captivating eyes,
Whose liquid chains could flowing meet
To fetter her Redeemer's feet.
Not full sails hasting loaden home,
Nor the chaste lady's pregnant womb,
Nor Cynthia teeming shows so fair
As two eyes swollen with weeping are.
The sparkling glance that shoots desire,
Drenched in these waves, does lose its fire ;
Yea oft the Thunderer pity takes,
And here the hissing lightning slakes.
The incense was to Heaven dear,
Not as a perfume, but a tear ;
And stars shew lovely in the night,
But as they seem the tears of light.
Ope then, mine eyes, your double sluice,
And practise so your noblest use ;
For others too can see, or sleep,
But only human eyes can weep.
Now, like two clouds dissolving, drop,
And at each tear in distance stop ;
Now, like two fountains, trickle down ;
Now, like two floods, o'erturn and drown :
Thus let your streams o'erflow your springs,
Till eyes and tears be the same things ;
And each the other's difference bears,
These weeping eyes, those seeing tears.",The swollen eyes of the shrewd shrewdness of the,"The poem, ‘Eyes and Tears‘ by Andrew Marvell is also metaphysical by virtue of its unusual imagery and its metaphors which are both ingenious and just. There is, for instance; the image of tears which better measure tings and which are therefore like the plumb-lines by means of which the depth of water is measured. Then there is the metaphysical image of two tears which have long been weighed by Sorrow within the scales of the eyes, and then been “paid out in equal poise”. Highly metaphysical is the conceit according to which the all-seeing sun each day extracts the essence of this world in the form of moisture which then returns to the earth in the shape of rain-drops which are here regarded as the tears of the sun. However, the Biblical image of Magdalen bathing the feet of Jesus Christ with her tears is not metaphysical but it is valuable in deepening the pathos of Eyes and Tears. There is a metaphysical conceit in the comparison of the copious human tears with broad rivers of overflowing their banks. There is a fanciful picture in the lines where the poet tells us that even the destructive lighting which belongs to Jove gets extinguished in his tears of pity. Then there are a number of images that are partly fanciful but mainly realistic. You can check this kind of image in the lines describing the beauty of eyes swollen with weeping. The beauty of such eyes, the readers are told, is greater than that of the sails of a ship on the homeward run, than that of a pregnant housewife, later than that of the full moon. Perfectly realistic but presented in a highly imaginative manner is the image of the lust of a man dissolving in his tears."

The poem begins with the speaker asking several questions regarding her partner's interpretation of sunrise. She doesn't feel that just because the sun has come up that he should leave their bed. She sees the sun as lacking the ability to control what they do. But, the man rises and starts his day, reengaging with the work that keeps his focus all the time. As the poem concludes, she compares herself to a mistress. She's always going to come after his business."
480,480,480,"I sing this song, full of sadness,
this song which is myself. I will tell, what I am able,
about what hardships I have faced—since I grew up,
recently or long ago, never more than now.
Always I suffer my misery of exile.
First my lord departed from my people,
over waves rolling; I had grief before dawn
thinking of the lands which held him, my people’s lord.
Then I set out, a friendless stranger, searching
for his retinue, because of my grievous need.
Relatives of this man began to plan
through secret thought that they would separate us,
that we as far apart as possible in the kingdom of the world
would live, wretchedly, and me longing.
My lord commanded me to take a grove for a house:
little of what is beloved to me did I possess in this country,
no loyal friends; for that is my mind’s sadness.
When I found the man who was my complete match,
he was unfortunate, sad of mind and heart,
with thoughts concealed, planning his crime
behind a joyful demeanor. Very often we vowed
that we would never be separated, not by death
or anything else; what was before is now changed,
is now as if it never were, that friendship
between us. Must I who desires you nearby
suffer, my dearly loved, this feud?
Commanded was I to dwell in a forest grove.
Under an oak tree, in a cave—the earth’s chest.
Old is this earth hall and I am filled with longing.
Here is a gloomy valley, treacherous hills,
bitter hedges, briars waxing, overgrown
in this house without joy. Very often my cruel departure
takes hold of me. Friends live on earth
lying in bed with their beloveds
while I in the time before dawn alone walk
under oak tree. In the earth’s chest
I sit many long summer days
weeping for the misery of exile
my many hardships; there I am never able
to rest from my mind’s grief
nor from all the longing that in this life takes hold of me.
It may be that he is always sorrowful,
his heart’s thoughts stern; perhaps he has
a joyful demeanor next to his grief,
its constant sorrowful tumult. Whether he is dependent on himself
for all of his worldly joy, or whether he is an outcast, very far
from his distant country, sitting
under stone cliffs frost-rimmed from storms,
friendless, water flowing before
his echoing home, my lover suffers
much grief of the mind. Too often he remembers
a house full of joy. Woe to those that must
of longing in life abide.","I sing this song, full of sadness, this song which is myself. I will tell,","'The Wife's Lament' by Anonymous is a multi-layered poem in which a speaker expresses her deep sorrow over her husband's departure. Depending on how one interprets the poem, that departure might refer to his death, his betrayal of her, or his travels to another country. There is evidence for all of these possible solutions to her vaguely defined grief. As the poem progresses, the speaker explains how deeply depressed she is by her circumstances. She's alone, without friends or family, and eventually forced to live in a hole or cave in the ground. “They,” likely the husband's kinsmen, are trying to keep her from finding her husband, whatever that means depending on the interpretation. Now, she has to spend the rest of her days with nothing but unhappiness on her mind. In the last lines, it appears that she's wishing the same sorrow on her husband."

comes to comfort me.
He stands apart
silent
and in his face I see
the patience of his trees

that promise no rain.

His eyes
the color of a crow’s feather in children’s mud,
yet filled with sharp mountain-top light.

Cummings is a very complex, yet strikingly powerful love poem that plays with the English language. Throughout the stanzas of this piece, Cummings repeats a general pattern of lines with parentheses, repeated structures, and words. It takes quite a while, at least four stanzas, to get into this pattern and start to understand what Cummings, or at least his speaker, was wanting to convey. He emphasizes throughout the stanzas the nature of “one” and how it is a representative of the strength and importance of his relationship with the intended listener of the poem. He uses bird and book-related images to convey his opinion that knowledge is better gained from love and nature than it is from the written word."

The poem begins with the speaker describing the scene on top of a hill beside a sign-post. It is cold, and the surrounding plant life is mostly dead. Here the speaker wonders which direction he should travel in and is confronted by two opposing voices, presumably within his own head. One mocks him for not knowing and becoming timid with age. The other reminds him that youth is not the only thing in life to be valued. The second voice takes control of the narrative in. It describes how one is going to age whether they want to or not. Eventually one will make their way to heaven where they will look down on the hard days on earth and miss them. They will long for the seasons of winter and spring and the uncertainty of daily life."

The poem begins with the speaker giving permission for her listener, a man she was in a relationship with, to go with another woman. She tells him he is more than welcome to gaze at her and smell her perfume. The speaker has no desire to reconcile with the man. This is all due to his choice to end the relationship. While the speaker was deeply hurt by this choice she now feels avenged. The woman he has chosen should not be trusted. The speaker knows the woman will soon leave him, causing him the same distress he caused her. When this happens her heart will finally be at peace."

Verbless Poetry As previously mentioned, one of the most striking elements of In the Station of a Metro is that it is written entirely without verbs. The poem is instead formed by combining two sentence fragments, each with a subject, but without an action, for that subject to perform. Needless to say, it can be very difficult to write without using action words, but this style does achieve one thing especially well: it captures a moment in time. In a sentence without action, nothing happens — in imagist poetry especially, this is a strength. In the case of this poem, it reads as an observation, as though the author has taken two photographs and paired them side by side."
486,486,486,"MANY ingenious lovely things are gone
That seemed sheer miracle to the multitude,
protected from the circle of the moon
That pitches common things about. There stood
Amid the ornamental bronze and stone
An ancient image made of olive wood --
And gone are Phidias' famous ivories
And all the golden grasshoppers and bees.
We too had many pretty toys when young:
A law indifferent to blame or praise,
To bribe or threat; habits that made old wrong
Melt down, as it were wax in the sun's rays;
Public opinion ripening for so long
We thought it would outlive all future days.
O what fine thought we had because we thought
That the worst rogues and rascals had died out.
All teeth were drawn, all ancient tricks unlearned,
And a great army but a showy thing;
What matter that no cannon had been turned
Into a ploughshare? Parliament and king
Thought that unless a little powder burned
The trumpeters might burst with trumpeting
And yet it lack all glory; and perchance
The guardsmen's drowsy chargers would not prance.
Now days are dragon-ridden, the nightmare
Rides upon sleep: a drunken soldiery
Can leave the mother, murdered at her door,
To crawl in her own blood, and go scot-free;
The night can sweat with terror as before
We pieced our thoughts into philosophy,
And planned to bring the world under a rule,
Who are but weasels fighting in a hole.
He who can read the signs nor sink unmanned
Into the half-deceit of some intoxicant
From shallow wits; who knows no work can stand,
Whether health, wealth or peace of mind were spent
On master-work of intellect or hand,
No honour leave its mighty monument,
Has but one comfort left: all triumph would
But break upon his ghostly solitude.
But is there any comfort to be found?
Man is in love and loves what vanishes,
What more is there to say? That country round
None dared admit, if Such a thought were his,
Incendiary or bigot could be found
To burn that stump on the Acropolis,
Or break in bits the famous ivories
Or traffic in the grasshoppers or bees.
When Loie Fuller's Chinese dancers enwound
A shining web, a floating ribbon of cloth,
It seemed that a dragon of air
Had fallen among dancers, had whirled them round
Or hurried them off on its own furious path;
So the platonic Year
Whirls out new right and wrong,
Whirls in the old instead;
All men are dancers and their tread
Goes to the barbarous clangour of a gong.
Some moralist or mythological poet
Compares the solitary soul to a swan;
I am satisfied with that,
Satisfied if a troubled mirror show it,
Before that brief gleam of its life be gone,
An image of its state;
The wings half spread for flight,
The breast thrust out in pride
Whether to play, or to ride
Those winds that clamour of approaching night.
A man in his own secret meditation
Is lost amid the labyrinth that he has made
In art or politics;
Some Platonist affirms that in the station
Where we should cast off body and trade
The ancient habit sticks,
And that if our works could
But vanish with our breath
That were a lucky death,
For triumph can but mar our solitude.
The swan has leaped into the desolate heaven:
That image can bring wildness, bring a rage
To end all things, to end
What my laborious life imagined, even
The half-imagined, the half-written page;
O but we dreamed to mend
Whatever mischief seemed
To afflict mankind, but now
That winds of winter blow
Learn that we were crack-pated when we dreamed.
We, who seven years ago
Talked of honour and of truth,
Shriek with pleasure if we show
The weasel's twist, the weasel's tooth.
Come let us mock at the great
That had such burdens on the mind
And toiled so hard and late
To leave some monument behind,
Nor thought of the levelling wind.
Come let us mock at the wise;
With all those calendars whereon
They fixed old aching eyes,
They never saw how seasons run,
And now but gape at the sun.
Come let us mock at the good
That fancied goodness might be gay,
And sick of solitude
Might proclaim a holiday:
Wind shrieked -- and where are they?
Mock mockers after that
That would not lift a hand maybe
To help good, wise or great
To bar that foul storm out, for we
Traffic in mockery.
Violence upon the roads: violence of horses;
Some few have handsome riders, are garlanded
On delicate sensitive ear or tossing mane,
But wearied running round and round in their courses
All break and vanish, and evil gathers head:
Herodias' daughters have returned again,
A sudden blast of dusty wind and after
Thunder of feet, tumult of images,
Their purpose in the labyrinth of the wind;
And should some crazy hand dare touch a daughter
All turn with amorous cries, or angry cries,
According to the wind, for all are blind.
But now wind drops, dust settles; thereupon
There lurches past, his great eyes without thought
Under the shadow of stupid straw-pale locks,

The poem, 'Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen' is about the subject of the temporariness of the world, war, violence, and politics depicted in the tone of idealism, frustration, pessimism, and lamentation. It speaks of how the most intelligent and beautiful things have gone from this world while war and violence are still constant in this world. Further, Yeats openly mocks at the great people, the wise, the good, and the mockers as well, who can never prevent negative things from happening in the world. Further, it gives a comprehensive image of violence that prevails in the world."

'Snow' is about several different experiences that occur at the same time. The speaker watches snow fall outside, admires some roses, eats a tangerine, and is warmed by a fire. It's also about the nature of experience itself, and how difficult it is to convey honestly when there is no one way to see or feel all the sensory impressions the world has to offer. As MacNeice puts it, everything insists on being “various,” making it hard to pin down."

And Island man wakes up
To the sound of blue surf
In his head
The steady breaking and wombing

Wild seabirds
And fisherman pulling out to sea

Comes back to sands
Of a grey metallic soar
To surge of wheels
To dull North Circular roar
Muffling muffling
His crumpled pillow waves

Another London day",The sun surfacing defiantly from the east of his small emeral,"'Island Man' by Grace Nichols tells of the difference between warm, hopeful island life and the cold, unfeeling world of London. The poem begins with the speaker to give a stream of consciousness depiction of an island and what it is like to wake up there. Everything is calm, the birds and waves are the only sounds one can hear. There are men pushing out their boats to fish, and the sun is defiant in its entry into the sky. In the third stanza, there is a transition, the man is forced to return to London and the grey world of the “North Circular” road. The cars fly past him, as does time. He has to drag himself from one day to the next, there is nothing defiant about this kind of life."

Holes, punched in the sky, which excited me partly because
Of their Latin names and partly because I had read in the textbooks

Had left them (some at least) long years before I was.

Forty-two years ago, will never arrive

In the first stanza of 'Star-Gazer', the speaker begins by recalling a time forty-two years ago when he was running from one side of a train car to another in order to see the light of the stars. He emphasizes their beauty, the power of their light, and the pleasure he takes from knowing anything about them. He goes on to describe their lifespans and allude to his own. The speaker knows that the light from some of the stars won't reach earth until after everyone has died."

Many poets will approach a theme such as immense grief or suffering with an abstract approach, one that captures the emotion by indirectly pointing out how difficult it is to properly express. In this poem, Longfellow speaks plainly about the death of a woman and uses his own feelings to propel the meaning of the poem, using only sparing metaphors to express them."

The poem begins with the speaker asking his lover to come and be with him forever. If she does this simple thing, they will be able to experience all the joy that the world has to offer. They will have all the best in life. He continues on to state that not only will they be happy in their love, but that he will create for her the most lovely of items. He will use the flowers in their new abode to craft pieces of clothing like hats and petticoats. The shepherd will also use the wool from their lambs to make her dresses. He clearly believes that these items of clothing will be enough, along with his love, to entice her to live with him. By the end of the piece, it is not clear whether or not she accepts his offer, but he seems to understand that it is up to her. He has done his best, and is awaiting her answer."

In changing this to the phonetically similar 'Juan's', Bogan is mocking the supposed drama of love, downplaying its importance by highlighting the more ridiculous parts. She argues that deep down everyone knows when love isn't working, things not feeling quite right. If this is true, how do people get so shocked and heartbroken at the end of love – she asks the question 'Who is it, then, that love deceives?'."

'Bermudas' by Andrew Marvell is a poem about a group of English pilgrims leaving their native land to the Bermuda islands. While they were on the boat sailing on the Bermuda sea, they could see the beautiful island of Bermuda. The poetic persona who narrates the pleasant aspects of the island, says that the island is “far kinder than our own?” It is to them a safe anode far from the religious harangue of their country. It lits their souls and provides them with a new hope. They can practice their religious rites and stay as they wish. There is no one to tell them what they should do or preach. It is a blissful place to start a new journey as they started long ago in their homeland."

O Life! by Walt Whitman is a poem where being capable of boosting the quality of “life” is presented through juxtaposed ideas. Specifically, the negatives of “life” are discussed as the forefront thoughts of the poem in striking juxtaposition to the “good” elements of “life” that are offered afterward for a strong contrast. Although there is far more negative said about “life” than positive, the poem still leaves the reader with the notion that while catching the “good” elements might be difficult since they are so rare in comparison to the “poor” details of “life,” embracing them can lead to a “life” where experience and possibility are enough to make “life” a “good” thing."

This speaker's exact location is not specified, making this poem applicable to anyone living anywhere in London at the time. The poem begins with a dark description of what is outside the speaker's home. The sky is described as “yellowed” and the houses so drab in their shape and form, as a line of fog. There is nothing in this landscape for one to marvel at or question the nature of. The speaker continues to speak of how the birds do not cast shadows as they fly through the city, the sun is unable to reach them through the thick layer of clouds, smog, and smoke that fills the air. It is like a huge canvas sheet has been placed over the top of the city keeping it in darkness. The poem concludes by relating the quick pace of those walking on the streets to the speed of the cars, carriages, and coaches passing. All appear identical and pause for nothing as they hurry along. The poem concludes by alluding to the state of the city, the lack of warmth and sun, being a punishment placed on the residents."

The poem’s main speaker—who seems to be addressing a crowd or audience of some sort—imitates the gung-ho, unflinching patriotism that was popular in the United States during and after World War I, but this speech is filled with shallow, rambling clichés and empty platitudes. As a result, the poem becomes a parody of patriotism itself, framing certain forms of national pride as misguided and thoughtless. More specifically, the poem suggests that mindless patriotism often leads to violence, since it can fuel enthusiasm for war."

The poem begins with the speaker asking the gods, as he does multiple times in the text, to give him something. This time it is a tobacco shop. This simple building and business represent something larger in the poem—a freedom and escape from the bustling modern world of endless commerce and industrial advancement. As the poem progresses Pound's speaker asks for other things, many of which would obviously be contained within his shop. In conclusion, the speaker who has begun to sound more and more like Pound himself, asks that the gods do something, anything, to remove him from his “damn'd profession of writing”."

At this time, the poem compares the interaction between the sun and Earth to the aftermath of dispassionate sex between a couple. It goes on to describe the harshness of the sun as dawn gives way to noon. Here, Love Cycle relates the earth's endurance of the sun's scorching rays to the forbearance of a woman dissatisfied by her partner. Towards the end, however, it speculates why she (Earth) remains in a relationship with him (the sun), and therefore why this natural phenomenon reoccurs. Love Cycle concludes by implicitly mentioning moonlight, a gentle reflection of the sun's rays. The subdued nature of the sun at night gives Earth free reign over her partner. Love Cycle points to this moment as the reason she stays."

The woman he envisions is kind, loving, and graceful. He utilizes nature imagery to create an almost nymph-like image in the mind of the reader. He imagines that this woman will enter his life and bring him nothing but joy and happiness. However, in the last stanza, the narrator admits that he knows it is possible that he will never meet this woman. He is also aware that it is possible they will cross paths but not end up together. While he dreams of one day finding his dream woman, he knows it is very possible that it will not happen."

All he knew were phrases like “Gettinguptime” and “timeyouwereofftime.” The clock meant nothing to him. So he waited, outside of time, and unbothered.

The poem begins with the speaker describing how he went down into the dungeons. He commanded the doors be opened and he looked in on the darkness. The speaker clearly has some authority here and maintains that as he addresses the warder. From this point on the majority of the narrative is focused around one “captive” held in the dungeon. This person is a young woman who appears pure, beautiful, and unconcerned by her situation. In warder is bothered by the woman's appearance. She is not as downtrodden as she should be. The woman speaks to the listener and the warder. She tells them that she is not unhappy, as she knows she won't be trapped in this place forever. Soon, she will be set free. When she is questioned about how this could be the case, she tells about her nightly visits. As she sleeps she is visited by Hope. It tells her that her short life will be rewarded in Heaven. This fact keeps her in good spirits. She does not see the point in crying or mourning as it will not save her or her imprisoned “kindred.” The following sections are used to describe the details of her dreams. They show her what her life will be like in heaven. There will be mute sounds that soothe her. All knowledge will be revealed and truths shown. The poem concludes with the speaker mourning the moments she returns to her waking life. They bring her a great deal of pain. The last lines show that the speaker has a new understanding of his captive. He has also seen that man's rule can be “overuled” by heaven. Explore more Emily Brontë poems."

What?","'The Collar' by George Herbert describes a speaker's desire to escape from his religious life and turn to one of greater freedom. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he will stand for his present life no longer. It is time for him to make a change and he intends to resurrect the parts of himself the lost in his youth. He will seek out real pleasures and no longer worry about what is right and wrong. As the poem continues, the extent of his confinement is revealed. He has crafted a prison for himself out of his own belief. The ropes will no longer keep him and he will utilize his fears to his own benefit. He will be a stronger man. The final lines bring the speaker back to his religious reality. The voice of God penetrates through his “rav[ing]” and calms his ardor. He will not do as he said he would; he has been taken back into the fold of the church."

Her nights in argument
Until her voice grew shrill.
What voice more sweet than hers When, young and beautiful, She rode to harriers?
This man had kept a school And rode our wingèd horse; This other his helper and friend Was coming into his force;
He might have won fame in the end, So sensitive his nature seemed, So daring and sweet his thought.
This other man I had dreamed
A drunken, vainglorious lout.
He had done most bitter wrong

In the casual comedy;

Too long a sacrifice
Can make a stone of the heart. O when may it suffice?

No, no, not night but death; Was it needless death after all?

Before the Rising, they were just ordinary people who worked in shops and offices. He remembers his childhood friend Constance Markievicz, who is “that woman”; the Irish language teacher Padraic Pearse, who “kept a school” called St. Enda's; the poet Thomas MacDonagh “helper and friend” to Pearse; and even Yeats's own rival in love John MacBride, “a drunken, vainglorious lout.” After reflecting on the rebels' constancy of purpose, as if their hearts were “enchanted to a stone,” the poet wonders whether the rebellion was worth it. The poem ends on a note of ambivalence and futility, reflecting Yeats's own reluctance to engage in political debate. The poem is divided into four stanzas, symbolizing the month of April, the fourth month. It is known for its famous refrain, “All changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty is born.”"

Through her poetic skills, she is able to build up a new poetic vision. The poet was also influenced by Charles Olson's essay “Projective Verse,” published in 1950, in which the entire focus remains on “the possibilities of breath” and the kinetics of a poem. However, just as she mediates or translates her personal experience into words, it shows her great poetic skills. It is only by virtue of her poetry that readers are able to familiarize themselves with the poet's experience, and obtain a different level of understanding. In What Were They Like?, Levertov combines the intellectual with the emotional experience, the personal with the public, to come up with what she calls an “inscape.” Levertov, rather than shedding light over the battlefield of the Vietnam War, shifts the readers' attention to the daily life of the Vietnamese. The way she makes use of irony, it makes their lot seem even more disastrous. Remember, the poet produces irony without using a war-like terminology to address the victims, but she employs simple words like “buds,” “lanterns,” “laughter,” “ornament,” and “singing” so that the attention of the readers can be transferred to the everydayness of reality, and turned to the value of all simple things that people like to share in their lives."

The poem begins with the speaker describing blackness as being both a “commitment” and a “title.” It is what one is referred to as, but is also a promise one makes to “perceive” one's “Glory.” It is necessary for all black people to know their own greatness and worth. The speaker continues on to say that in white culture it is easy to say that it is a great thing to be white, so easy in fact that many black people would say the same. She looks down on this perception and knows that unless that individual belief is changed, nothing else will. She also describes the fact that “Blackness” is like a calling card. It is something that reaches across great distances and unifies all those who even have a drop of black blood. The poem comes to its conclusion with the speaker raising her voice and demanding that all those, no matter how much black blood they have, accept their own race and heritage."

They were as repetitive and unchanging as “grey house[s]” on grey houses. In amongst the city of hours, there were streets which trailed off into a “field of green.” There used to be a way out of the maze of buildings, but it has long since been forgotten. The second stanza describes another period experienced by the speaker. This is one of longing and eternal disappointment. She describes these times as the “white crests” of mountains peeking through the clouds. They are “forbidden” to her as they are completely out of her reach. In the final stanza Hall's speaker turns to address time as a whole. She sees it as being a “tapestry of hours.” All of one's positive and negative experiences, as well as those in the future and those which one will never see, are all blended together. There is no way to separate the good from the bad, it is all connected."

The poem begins with the birth of a “girlchild” who is immediately given all the toys she will need to learn how to be a good mother and wife. She has a “GE stove” and a baby doll, which requires diaper changes. The girl is immediately being trained in her future subservient role. She enters puberty, and the insults of other children start to wear away at her. They say that she has “a great big nose and fat legs.” These judgments stay with this young woman for the rest of her life. The speaker makes sure to emphasize all of the beautiful qualities this woman possesses, but neither she nor her peers are able to see and appreciate them. All they can see are her supposed “faults.” In the second half of Barbie Doll, worn down by the words of others, the woman cuts off her nose and legs as an offering to the world that has tormented her. She dies and is buried with a reconstructed face and “turn-up nose.” In death, the speaker ironically states, she has found the happy ending all women desire."

Just because she’s quiet, doesn’t mean she needs company. The same request is applied later on in the poem. If she’s struggling to get upstairs, don’t pity her and bring her a rocking chair. She doesn’t want to be treated any differently than when she was young.

There are no other words to complete the thought. It stands alone, and is the word “loneliness”. The phrase “a leaf falls” can be found inside of the parenthesis. This creates an image of emptiness and solitude and reflects the written “loneliness” that runs parallel to it. This leaf falls by itself and is not with other leaves. The image of a leaf falling also implies death. The life of the leaf is over for the season. The cold of the winter is soon to come and the chill of the fall has rendered the leaf lifeless. Thus, it falls to the ground by itself. This image is one of loneliness. The phrase existing inside of the word “loneliness” allows the reader to feel the emptiness mention here. The poem also functions visually. The words inside the parenthesis look like a leaf as it sways back and forth in the wind as it falls to the ground. Thus, this is more than just a poem. It is also a work of art made from a few words. The visual qualities of the text allow the reader to experience not only the imagery created by the description of the leaf falling to the ground in loneliness but also to experience the imagery created by the words and the way they are arranged."

But Petrarch evolved a new pattern of his own. He made the new sonnets the way to express human feelings. Both Dante and Petrarch idealized love but Petrarch to the earthly plane, vibrating the warm heartbeats of the lover. With the newly evolved Renaissance, the intense love for beauty, both celestial and earthly inculcated into men's minds. As Petrarch was influenced by Renaissance Humanism, his sonnets spoke about the glory of human love. The sonnets are composed of an octave followed by a sestet giving it a sort of revelation.

In the first lines of 'Before the Birth of One of Her Children,' the speaker begins by noting that everything in the world will eventually come to an end. This includes those she loves and the child she's carrying inside her. There is nothing strong enough to stand up against the specter of death. She notes the fact that her husband is probably going to die soon and how she doesn't know whether she's going to die in childbirth. It's a mystery whether she's going to make it through the pregnancy. She's writing this poem as a goodbye to her husband, who she may never get to properly say goodbye to. She hopes that she lives, but she wants him to know that even if she doesn't, she's still his. The speaker also wants her husband to know that she's fine with him remarrying but hopes he still takes care of her children if the new mother is cruel. Finally, she asks that her husband kiss this paper every once in a while to acknowledge the fact that she once loved him (if, of course, she does end up dying)."

In the first lines of this piece, the speaker sets the scene. It is June, and the reader is thrust into a still house in which there is a still room. All alone in the room is a canary trapped in a cage. As the sun sets it sings out to the last of the light and warmth. In contrast to the caged bid, there is a free bird on the lilac bush. It heard everything and after pausing, replies. There is some kind of correspondence between the two and the reader is left to wonder about their positions as “free” and “prisoner.”"

Specifically, his sternness is addressed through fitting examples, standard lowercase letters, and a lack of punctuation, but that is contrasted with the variation seen in the syllables of ‘From Not Him,’ as well as his limited “respect” and the “wiggl[ing of] his toes.” This contrast can be interpreted as a representation of people in general since often people are a blend of stern and flexible, and this simple tale told from the perspective of a child helps to solidify that concept.

Then, in the third stanza, it hits its prime where it is stretched to its will width and much calmer. This leads it into its final stage when it flows into the ocean and eternity. In this last stanza, the metaphorical life cycle of the river is completed and it ends up as a symbol for eternity, a religious allusion to God and Heaven."

One should not be unaware of their origin, meaning history. At the inauguration, Williams wanted to show the people of America how their history reflected the zeal for the betterment of the nation. The speaker of the poem, an old and wide voice portraying the poet, expresses their days are about to end. They have achieved what they meant to achieve. Now, the future of America lies in the hands of the children. How one brings up one's child leads to nation-building. Hence, the speaker advises everyone to invest in their budding generation to achieve optimum growth, both socially and economically."

Go out and track the badger to his den,
And put a sack within the hole, and lie
Till the old grunting badger passes by.
He comes an hears - they let the strongest loose.
The old fox gears the noise and drops the goose.
The poacher shoots and hurries from the cry,
And the old hare half wounded buzzes by.
They get a forked stick to bear him down
And clap the dogs and take him to the town,
And bait him all the day with many dogs,

Though scarcely half as big, demure and small,
He fights with dogs for hours and beats them all.
The heavy mastiff, savage in the fray,

The bulldog knows his match and waxes cold,
The badger grins and never leaves his hold.
He drives the crowd and follows at their heels

But sticks and cudgels quickly stop the chase.
He turns again and drives the noisy crowd

He drives away and beats them every one,

The poem is written in iambic pentameter with a consistent rhyming pattern, using couplets (AABBCC…) although rhyme in contemporary poetry is often used to denote humor or joy, it was more frequently used in classical poetry, even in more somber poetry as is the case with this poem. This is somewhat bleak and chronicles the story of animals being used in badger baiting. A cruel blood sport where a badger is pulled from its home and repeatedly attacked by large dogs is a practice that, whilst illegal, is still occasionally practiced today."

The poem begins with the speaker describing how she finds joy and peace in equal measure out in nature. She likes to go and “lie a little while” underneath a specific tree. From her spot there she sees the sky above her, looking down and protecting her. She is also able to enjoy the feeling of the dappled sunlight on her skin and take in the lace-like patterns it produces. In the second half of the poem, she describes the way the “Wind” sneaks up on her and whispers “pretty things” in her ear. Everywhere around her there is a force of nature ready to comfort her if she needs it."

The poet's misery of being in love clear in the contradictory images present. In this poem 'I Find no Peace,' the speaker expresses his misery of being in love through absolutely contradictory ideas. The title which is also the first line begins with his inability to rest despite having no war to fight. His conflicting emotions are present in the way he is optimistic and afraid, ablaze and frozen, soaring yet unable to take off, desires death yet demands strength. He says he has nothing, yet he holds the whole world. Further, he feels there are no locks strong enough to bind or imprison him, yet bound by love in an inescapable prison. Ultimately, he feels that he has no control over his life or death. Also, in love, he sees without his eyes and complains without a tongue. Towards the end of the poem, the speaker seems to be happy despite the paradoxical elements of love."

In this poem, Hass beautifully depicts an autumn afternoon by using precise images. This poem is not a personal recapitulation of a day. Rather, it is more about the colors of nature and how it displays the internal emotions of the speaker. He is seen cooking for his loved ones. In the first stanza, he describes the natural landscape. Then, the poet goes on to describe the surroundings and the room where the food is served."

In this poem, the poet starts to talk about his mother's sadness that he tries to understand. Somehow he cannot understand what pained his mother when she was alive. Later he tells readers that it was the thoughts of death or dying that made his mother sad. Thereafter, the poet contemplates what it feels like to be dead. Interestingly, it appears a “form of gratitude” to him. Lastly, the speaker of the poem wants to be a hummingbird. Besides, he wishes to imitate its “nectar-questing song” along with his mother in heaven."

It was a small part of,"Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird' by Wallace Stevens uses the blackbird as a way to describe the relations between humankind, nature, and emotions. The poem begins with a number of short stanzas, cantos, or sections which place the blackbird as an integral part of the world. It outlasts other creatures in the snow, stands in as a muse for the speaker, and appears in a number of different forms. The bird is made up of more than its simple physiology. It contains beauty, innuendos, and eccentricities which separate it from other creatures. 'Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird' concludes with the speaker returning to a snowy day in which he can look out at the landscape as see his muse and guardian, within a cedar tree, looking down over his home. The bird is a force on which he can depend. It will always be there, in one form or another, to watch over him."

'Song' begins with the speaker asking his listener, who is either his own inner being, or a lover of one variety of another, to “stay at home.” This person seems frail to the speaker, as if she cannot live beyond the walls of a home. He asks that she not “wander” as some do, as it is an unhappy and unfulfilling life. He spends an amount of time describing just how unpleasant the lives of wanderers are and how they are never happy, always listless, and continually doubtful of their choices. This is not a life he wants for either himself or his lover. In the final lines, he repeats his previous sentiments and compares his “heart” to that of a bird who might be preyed on by a hawk."

Where once you sang, the gardens you shall mourn,
And the tall house with empty windows where

'Lot's Wife' by Anna Akhmatova presents the sad story of Lot's wife in an innovative manner. It seems the poet is actually sensitive about the story in which the poor wife of Lot turned into a statue of salt. Her lonely statue still stands on the “black mountain”. Men trailed by, overlooking it. But the poetic persona can hear the voices from the past. Someone is telling the lady to “look back”. The native people of “Sodom” blessed the marriage of Lot and the lady. However, fate was not in her favor. Her happy moments of married life turned into a lifelong burden of suffering. Inside the statue, the voice seems to be trapped. The poet can hear it. She says, “Yet in my heart I never will deny her,/ who suffered because she chose to turn.” The last line does not sound like regret. It celebrates the feminine perseverance in her heart."

The speaker begins this piece by describing the room in which she is trapped and her curse, like the Lady of Shalott, to sit before a loom and weave only the shadows she sees in her mirror. As the poem continues it becomes clear that the speaker deeply resents knowing what the world can be, and being unable to see it. She wants at least to be able to weave something of interest, or have some control over the life, like Penelope, but that is not to be. She is, or seems to be, eternally trapped within this room with her “web” darkening, and her mirror of shadows."

In this poem, Hall's speaker begins with reference to a number of “golden” things such as the pale gold walls, centers of daisies, and yellow roses. These are meant to symbolize the precious memories the speaker wove with his beloved. Then, he talks about affectionate gestures like “caressing and dozing” to show how they made love. Hall refers to a “golden room” as a metaphor for their love. The room of his glorious past would remain intact even after their death. In the end, the poet says that they left similar golden rooms or remnants within one another. The yellowish aura of the rooms is so bright and wholesome that it would never dim."

In doing so, the speaker frames the Civil War—and, in turn, war in general—as a “ruthless force” capable of stopping the country in its tracks. War, the poem implies, affects everything."

Forgetting, or never
Regretting, its roses—
Its old agitations

Lying, it fancies
A holier odor
About it, of pansies—
A rosemary odor,
Commingled with pansies—
With rue and the beautiful
Puritan pansies.

Bathing in many
A dream of the truth
And the beauty of Annie—
Drowned in a bath
Of the tresses of Annie.

She fondly caressed,

To sleep on her breast—
Deeply to sleep
From the heaven of her breast.

To keep me from harm—
To the queen of the angels
To shield me from harm.

That you shudder to look at me,
Thinking me dead:—

Than all of the many

This long poem written in the praise of “Annie” presents how the poet felt before his recovery from his mental agony. It was a phase when the poet was like a living dead. If one looked at him they might think him to be a dead person. But when that lady came into his life, he started to recover gradually. For her selfless love and care, he has recovered from that mental ailment. For this reason, Poe expresses his gratitude to his friend, “Annie” to be with him when he needed her the most."

She opens the gate of her heart and finds herself with her lover. He touches her with his soft, warm hands. But, she can feel nothing except a solitary feeling. She introspects on death and the real value of life. Finally, she gets an answer from a text she read a while ago.

In the first section of the poem, the speaker begins by describing a creature, the swan, which is only named in the sixth line of the poem. The swan is living amongst a “bronze,” autumn landscape that contains numerous beech trees dipping their branches into a body of water. The swan is described as having a red-tipped head and wings and being able to glide through the water like a sailing ship. It is creating “furrows” in the water as it moves, impacting all the surrounding life. In the final stanzas, the speaker states that the swan is headed off into the distance where there are a number of “great towers,” presumably a city. The speaker admits that if he could he would join the bird in its journey and relish the pleasure of watching the hills in the distance make way for them."

The young speaker begins by comparing her front yard to the life she's living and her backyard and the adjoining alley to the kind of life she wants to experience. She's jealous of the freedom the charity children have. It's something she'd like for herself, even if it does come with implications of future crimes and bad behavior.

The poem takes the reader through a series of violent images that depict an abusive relationship between a male/female newlywed couple. Although the narrative is not clearly defined, there are certain poignant moments that inform the reader of the dynamic between the two. The woman does what she can to control her husband's anger. She tries to make herself as perfect as possible or face the “werewolf” that she married."

The poem is brief, swiftly taking the reader into the world of the speaker and the fear and terror of the new world that has found himself in. Living in a ghetto in Nazi Germany the speaker has seen his last butterfly. It rose up and out of sight, away from the darkness all around him."

It describes the various mischievous acts of Mr. Nobody. In the first stanza of this poem, the speaker notes that there is a “funny little man” who is as quiet as a mouse who lives within every home. It is this Mr. Nobody who is responsible for broken plates, leaving doors open, putting damp wood on the fire, bringing mud into the house, misplacing the morning paper, and leaving the blinds open. These simple mistakes, acts of mischief, and messes are all everyday occurrences that are sources of trouble for children. The poem takes a clever approach to the idea of a child shifting the blame for breaking a plate over to “Mr. Nobody.”"

In trenches, crouching for the crumps to burst,
While squeaking rats scampered across the slime

In the first stanza, the subaltern confides in the speaker about the “bloody time” he is having in the war. The speaker observes him almost lovingly, detailing his beauty which appears in sharp contrast to the undeniable horror and bleakness around them. In the second stanza, the moment of genuine connection shared by the two men is broken by the speaker's “stale philosophies” and the subaltern dismisses his words and feelings as “tripe.”"

The poem begins with the speaker praising God and his ability to improve the speaker's own state of being. It is clear from the start of 'Unprofitableness' that the narrator has a very low opinion of himself. Even by the end of the poem, when God's light has made him infinitely better, he still isn't good enough to bequeath one leaf or flower to a wreath in heaven."
546,546,546,"Are you content, you pretty three-years’ wife?
Are you content and satisfied to live
On what your loving husband loves to give,
And give to him your life?

Are you content with work, — to toil alone,
To clean things dirty and to soil things clean;
To be a kitchen-maid, be called a queen, —
Queen of a cook-stove throne?

Are you content to reign in that small space --
A wooden palace and a yard-fenced land --
With other queens abundant on each hand,
Each fastened in her place?

Are you content to rear your children so?
Untaught yourself, untrained, perplexed, distressed,
Are you so sure your way is always best?
That you can always know?

Have you forgotten how you used to long
In days of ardent girlhood, to be great,
To help the groaning world, to serve the state,
To be so wise — so strong?

And are you quite convinced this is the way,
The only way a woman’s duty lies --
Knowing all women so have shut their eyes?
Seeing the world to-day?

Having no dream of life in fuller store?
Of growing to be more than that you are?
Doing the things you know do better far,
Yet doing others - more?

Losing no love, but finding as you grew
That as you entered upon nobler life
You so became a richer, sweeter wife,
A wiser mother too?

What holds you? Ah, my dear, it is your throne,
Your paltry queenship in that narrow place,
Your antique labours, your restricted space,
Your working all alone!

But selfish, slavish service hour by hour --
A life with no beyond!","Are you content and satisfied to live On what your loving husband loves to give, And give to","Each stanza, aside from the last, of this poem, begins with a question. The speaker is hoping, through her incessant questioning and probing, to reveal to the “young wife” that her life is not exactly what it seems. She is not the “queen” of a kingdom like she is treated. She is only in charge of a confining house and a stove. The speaker continues to ask the woman if she did not have a better life in mind for herself when she was younger. One in which she could do something meaningful. She also states that until she has become a fuller person, the young wife will not be able to raise her children to the best of her abilities. To the Young Wife concludes by stating that setting out from home to better oneself does not result in a loss of love but the improvement of oneself as a person. This pursuit of passion will allow the young wife to be a better wife and mother. The last lines make clear that it is not her vows which hold her in the home but the unending service she provides to the home. She is able to set herself free."
547,547,547,"Like as a huntsman after weary chase,
Seeing the game from him escap'd away,
Sits down to rest him in some shady place,
With panting hounds beguiled of their prey:
So after long pursuit and vain assay,
When I all weary had the chase forsook,
The gentle deer return'd the self-same way,
Thinking to quench her thirst at the next brook.
There she beholding me with milder look,
Sought not to fly, but fearless still did bide:
Till I in hand her yet half trembling took,
And with her own goodwill her firmly tied.
Strange thing, me seem'd, to see a beast so wild,
So goodly won, with her own will beguil'd.","Like as a huntsman after weary chase, Seeing the game from him","In this sonnet, titled ‘Amoretti LXVII: Like as a Huntsman,’ Edmund Spenser draws a parallel between a huntsman and his pursuit of prey and his own pursuit of love. The poem explores themes of desire, perseverance, and the surprising nature of love. The huntsman, exhausted from his fruitless chase, finds respite in a shady spot, accompanied by his panting hounds, who have been deprived of their prey. Similarly, the speaker of the poem has engaged in a long and futile pursuit of his beloved, only to abandon it in weariness. However, just as the deer that was being pursued by the huntsman unexpectedly returns to the same location, the speaker’s love interest comes back to him, seemingly with the intention of quenching her thirst at a nearby brook. The deer, upon seeing the speaker, does not attempt to flee but rather remains fearless and steadfast in his presence. The speaker then approaches the deer, who is trembling but does not resist, and he firmly binds her at her own consent. The speaker finds it strange and remarkable to witness a wild animal willingly and beautifully won over."

The first part of the poem lists out a few different people, from a nun to hermit and student. Each lives in a different place and experiences different confides. This life, even if it seems confining to someone else, isn't. It's not really a prison, the poet says. The poem concludes with the poet discussing his own “prison,” the sonnet form. It's something that he finds peace in and he takes pleasure from the fact that a few others may as well."

She Dwelt among the Untrodden Ways has three quatrains with simple language (mainly words of one syllable), and it has an ABAB rhyme scheme. Furthermore, Wordsworth’s poem can be read as an elegiac poem, with graceful descriptions and a mourning tone. Thus, She Dwelt among the Untrodden Ways’s main theme is death, a death that is described and grieved for throughout the entire poem."
550,550,550,"I MIND me in the days departed,
How often underneath the sun
With childish bounds I used to run
To a garden long deserted.
The beds and walks were vanish'd quite;
And wheresoe'er had struck the spade,
The greenest grasses Nature laid,
To sanctify her right.
I call'd the place my wilderness,
For no one enter'd there but I.
The sheep look'd in, the grass to espy,
And pass'd it ne'ertheless.
The trees were interwoven wild,
And spread their boughs enough about
To keep both sheep and shepherd out,
But not a happy child.
Adventurous joy it was for me!
I crept beneath the boughs, and found
A circle smooth of mossy ground
Beneath a poplar-tree.
Old garden rose-trees hedged it in,
Bedropt with roses waxen-white,
Well satisfied with dew and light,
And careless to be seen.
Long years ago, it might befall,
When all the garden flowers were trim,
The grave old gardener prided him
On these the most of all.
Some Lady, stately overmuch,
Here moving with a silken noise,
Has blush'd beside them at the voice
That liken'd her to such.
Or these, to make a diadem,
She often may have pluck'd and twined;
Half-smiling as it came to mind,
That few would look at them.
O, little thought that Lady proud,
A child would watch her fair white rose,
When buried lay her whiter brows,
And silk was changed for shroud!—
Nor thought that gardener (full of scorns
For men unlearn'd and simple phrase)
A child would bring it all its praise,
By creeping through the thorns!
To me upon my low moss seat,
Though never a dream the roses sent
Of science or love's compliment,
I ween they smelt as sweet.
It did not move my grief to see
The trace of human step departed:
Because the garden was deserted,
The blither place for me!
Friends, blame me not! a narrow ken
Hath childhood 'twixt the sun and sward:
We draw the moral afterward—
We feel the gladness then.
And gladdest hours for me did glide
In silence at the rose-tree wall:
A thrush made gladness musical
Upon the other side.
Nor he nor I did e'er incline
To peck or pluck the blossoms white:—
How should I know but that they might
Lead lives as glad as mine?
To make my hermit-home complete,
I brought clear water from the spring
Praised in its own low murmuring,
And cresses glossy wet.
And so, I thought, my likeness grew
(Without the melancholy tale)
To 'gentle hermit of the dale,'
And Angelina too.
For oft I read within my nook
Such minstrel stories; till the breeze
Made sounds poetic in the trees,
And then I shut the book.
If I shut this wherein I write,
I hear no more the wind athwart
Those trees, nor feel that childish heart
Delighting in delight.
My childhood from my life is parted,
My footstep from the moss which drew
Its fairy circle round: anew
The garden is deserted.
Another thrush may there rehearse
The madrigals which sweetest are;
No more for me!—myself afar
Do sing a sadder verse.
Ah me! ah me! when erst I lay
In that child's-nest so greenly wrought,
I laugh'd unto myself and thought,
'The time will pass away.'
And still I laugh'd, and did not fear
But that, whene'er was pass'd away
The childish time, some happier play
My womanhood would cheer.
I knew the time would pass away;
And yet, beside the rose-tree wall,
Dear God, how seldom, if at all,
Did I look up to pray!
The time is past: and now that grows
The cypress high among the trees,
And I behold white sepulchres
As well as the white rose,—
When wiser, meeker thoughts are given,
And I have learnt to lift my face,
Reminded how earth's greenest place
The colour draws from heaven,—
It something saith for earthly pain,
But more for heavenly promise free,
That I who was, would shrink to be
That happy child again.","A young girl whose childhood was a long one, a garden long deserte","'The Deserted Garden' by Elizabeth Barrett Browning is a beautiful poem in which the speaker looks back on her childhood. The majority of this poem is spent meditating on the times the speaker spent as a young girl within a deserted garden. There, she contemplated what happened before it fell into disrepair, read books, listened to the thrush sing, and enjoyed her own childhood. Now, she looks back on that time with longing, wishing that she could feel the pleasures of youthful freedom again and regretting that her womanhood did not turn out as happily as she thought it would when she was resting in the mossy grove surrounded by white roses. Now, she's closer to death than she is to the child she used to be. But, she takes comfort from the fact that she'll be headed to Heaven, the place from which nature gets its greenest colors."
551,551,551,"I feel the spring far off, far off,
The faint, far scent of bud and leaf—
Oh, how can spring take heart to come
To a world in grief,
Deep grief?
The sun turns north, the days grow long,
Later the evening star grows bright—
How can the daylight linger on
For men to fight,
Still fight?
The grass is waking in the ground,
Soon it will rise and blow in waves—
How can it have the heart to sway
Over the graves,
New graves?
Under the boughs where lovers walked
The apple-blooms will shed their breath—
But what of all the lovers now
Parted by Death,
Grey Death?","The faint, far scent of bud and leaf is a sigh of relief.","This piece is a series of questions asked by a narrator who is confused about how spring can continue to come, the sun can continue to shine, and plants bloom under the shadow of war. The poem begins with the speaker's sensing of spring far off in the distance, but coming all the same. She asks how “Spring can take heart to come / To a world in grief.” She repeats this pattern in the rest of the stanzas questioning how daylight can persist while men “Still fight,” how grass can grow and wind can blow over “New graves,” and lastly, how apple-blooms can bud where lovers, now parted by death, once walked. In totality, this piece is meant to show that while war is powerful and it seems like it should stop the whole world in its tracks, it cannot. Fighting, and the problems of humans, cannot stop the seasons from changing, grass from growing, or trees from flowering."
552,552,552,"He drowsed and was aware of silence heaped
Round him, unshaken as the steadfast walls;
Aqueous like floating rays of amber light, 
Soaring and quivering in the wings of sleep.
Silence and safety; and his mortal shore
Lipped by the inward, moonless waves of death.
 
Someone was holding water to his mouth.
He swallowed, unresisting; moaned and dropped
Through crimson gloom to darkness; and forgot
The opiate throb and ache that was his wound.
Water—calm, sliding green above the weir;
Water—a sky-lit alley for his boat, 
Bird-voiced, and bordered with reflected flowers
And shaken hues of summer: drifting down, 
He dipped contented oars, and sighed, and slept.
 
Night, with a gust of wind, was in the ward,
Blowing the curtain to a gummering curve.
Night. He was blind; he could not see the stars
Glinting among the wraiths of wandering cloud;
Queer blots of colour, purple, scarlet, green,
Flickered and faded in his drowning eyes.
 
Rain—he could hear it rustling through the dark;
Fragrance and passionless music woven as one;
Warm rain on drooping roses; pattering showers
That soak the woods; not the harsh rain that sweeps
Behind the thunder, but a trickling peace, 
Gently and slowly washing life away.

He stirred, shifting his body; then the pain
Leaped like a prowling beast, and gripped and tore
His groping dreams with grinding claws and fangs.
But someone was beside him; soon he lay
Shuddering because that evil thing had passed.
And death, who'd stepped toward him, paused and stared. 
 
Light many lamps and gather round his bed.
Lend him your eyes, warm blood, and will to live.
Speak to him; rouse him; you may save him yet.
He's young; he hated war; how should he die
When cruel old campaigners win safe through?
 
But death replied: “I choose him.” So he went,
And there was silence in the summer night;
Silence and safety; and the veils of sleep.
Then, far away, the thudding of the guns.","Aqueous like floating rays of amber light, Soaring and quivering","'The Death Bed' by Siegfried Sassoon tells of the suffering and eventual peaceful death of a soldier mortally wounded in World War I. The poem begins with the speaker describing the terrible condition a young soldier is in. The only moments he gets any relief from the pain are those induced by opiates. When asleep, he can drift through his mind on a river. It is a peaceful symbol for death and the afterlife that the young man seems to welcome. As the poem progresses the contrast between his sleeping and waking worlds is further emphasized. When he moves, he is in incredible agony as if a beast jumped on his body and was trying to tear him apart. Eventually, death comes to his side, and decides it is time for him to go. From there, the two depart, and silence falls again over the hospital ward. The last line reminds the reader that the war rages on right outside the hospital. You read the full poem here."

It is clear from the beginning that this speaker is deep within a depressive state, she speaks clearly on the misery that is within her heart and the fact that it is only intensified by the woods themselves. The plants and creatures she will encounter there do nothing to soothe her, but instead, bring back powerful memories of her experiences in the past. The second stanza elaborates on these emotions and the speaker asks of the wood that she is allowed to sit within its darkest corner. Not only does she wish to inflict further emotional distress on herself by entering the woods, but she also wants to find the darkest part. In addition to this request, she asks that she can find the strength to not “swoon” when she is there. The third stanza is made up of the speaker's description of how she will act when she is there. She will be as a stone, cold and unmoving, but she will not be alone. The final two lines of the piece are a question asked by the speaker, hoping that God can somehow bring back the time in which she and her lover walked in the wood together. This is the first time in which the poem the source of her depression is made clear."

The poem starts with the usual description of the usual coming of the woman to the well. The poet's use of the verb “came” suggests that the poet was already there to observe it. This old woman's presence gave the poet joy and happiness, as he used to watch her every time. However, in the sestet, the poet moves inside the house, and also from day to night. This shows that Heaney is so familiar with the old woman that he knew all about her. The final line of the poem suggests that the old woman to be his “muse” meaning she gave him the “inspiration”. He “drinks the water as if receiving inspiration” to express his memories and life experiences as a young boy living on a farm in Ireland."

'Attack' by Siegfried Sassoon is a haunting poem that discusses the reality of war and what happens when a soldier is out on the battlefield. Sassoon transitions between describing the battlefield physically, to describing the soldiers physically and eventually conclude with the feelings of the soldiers. Sassoon builds suspense with every line and uses imagery, personification, and enjambment to capture the reader's attention and as accurately as possible describe the true horrors of being a soldier at war."

While the tone throughout the poem is quite melancholy, the speaker also seems to be realistic when it comes to love, comparing the cycles in nature to the cycle of romance.

Using a simple image from nature, he projects the gender differences and the momentariness of emotions that exist in the human world. The 'Big Poppy' on the outset is a simple poem about the poppy flower and the bumble bee's attraction towards the sexuality emanating from the poppy flower. The personified Poppy flower and the Bumblebee demonstrate the sexual attraction between them. The exchange between the flower and the Bee deals with the temporariness of the relationship. The poet's choice of words and tone clarifies that there is no tender love present. However, in the end, the flower's extravagance becomes a villain bringing it to its doom."

The poem begins with a direct address to a “Sweet” lady who had admirable qualities during her youth. She was so blind due to her beauty that she could not understand the feelings of a genuine lover. She hurt her and metaphorically trod upon his “heart.” The poet says it was rather the person's fault who came in her way. At the end, when her physical beauty fades away, she is going to regret her decision. Then she would realize the importance of true love that is not time's fool, a fleeting feeling."

Throughout this short poem, Berryman's speaker describes Henry's depression as a weight on his heart that he can't get rid of. Even when it fades for a moment, it always comes back when Henry hears, sees, or smells something triggering. The speaker adds another layer to Henry's confusion as he describes the man's perception of himself as a killer. Although he's wrong, Henry continually has to check to make sure that he hasn't killed anyone and chopped up their body. "

Its earlier title was 'Sir, No Man's Enemy'. It was published in the poetic volume, Poems (1930. It was the last poem in the volume. At the time of its composition, Auden was a psychologist poet. Under the influence of Sigmund Freud, George Groddeck, Homer Lane, John Layard, and D.H. Lawrence, he believed that man's 'psychological ills' were 'greater' than this 'political' ones. His belief can be stated as follows: Sexual love is the main urge in man. It draws man and woman together. If it is allowed a free play, it bursts forth as the Life-force, called Id in man. But there is another force too in man. It is the death instinct, which reflects itself as the fear of death. It lies vested in the faculty of mind and is called the Super-ego. So the belief under which the present poem was composed can be summed up as follows: Modern human culture and civilization have systematically repressed sexual love in man and in society for ages and ages. The result is that society is ruled by morals and laws of the Super-ego which is the Death-force to sexual love. In effect, society is ruled by Death-force, and man and society are 'sick', or rather, inhibited by death-wish. Let me tell you here that society and individuals are sick because men and their culture have repressed vital human forces (in themselves). The Super-ego has nearly defeated the 'id' (i.e. Life-force). Cure demands a change of heart, a change in the individuals. The power of the super-ego must be overthrown and the languishing 'id' released from its fetters.'"

The speaker emphasizes that she is not resigned to death even if she knows it will happen to everyone. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker begins by telling readers that she has not resigned herself to the fact that all people, thinkers, and lovers included, eventually end up in the darkness of the earth. All of these people go into the dark with only a little remaining to be remembered. The witty, the intelligent, kind, and all those who have ever done well on earth will end up in the dark, with their body, memories, and spirits, feeding the roses. The poet's speaker continues to resist this fact. She is “not resigned,” meaning she is not giving up when it comes to the idea of death."

It comes in a variety of forms, from “Shadow” in the fourth line, to “light…hidden” and “obscure things.” There are continual references to something dark or obscure. This changes the tone of the text, making it more mysterious and even dangerous. It is not clear why Neruda made this choice, but clearly, there is something about the situation that edges him towards the darker side of things. Another detail of note, Neruda uses the second person. He is directly speaking to one person. Considering the fact that the collection in which the poem as included, Love Sonnets, is dedicated to Neruda's wife. This should lead one to believe that Matilde Urrutia is the intended listener."

Stafford's descriptive language helps readers imagine a sweet love story between the speaker and Ruth in this poem. The use of words like “relics” and “monuments” makes the poem seem like a special tribute to the girl. In the first stanza, the speaker says that Ruth glanced back at him. It clearly shows that she also felt for the speaker. He also highlights the reason for their parting and wishes her to be safe in heaven. Overall, this poem reflects how the speaker misses her to this very day and wishes if he would have had spent some more “seconds” with her."

Instead of having her child repeat the childhood that Melnick had, she tries to be a better parent. The poem has many delicate moments, Melnick displaying touching instances of parental love. Twelve starts by focusing on what the poet was doing when she 'was your age'. This then moves down to a comparison with the peaceful slumber of her daughter, protected from the world. Melnick moves through more examples, including being letting 'boys' 'claw her carcass' for a 'quarter'. The poet vows to give her daughter a better life, not wanting her to 'know what I know'."

She believes that in a past life she was once 'some tribal warrior' or 'a Loyalist hiding in the woods', hiding their child from sight. She imagines that the cover of rainfall would be the perfect weather to stop them from being heard as they ran away, with the footsteps becoming lost in the downpour. Spidel connects with this far away identity, seeing herself as a descendant of this historic woman. They both listen for the rain, still in the darkness while waiting for the first signs of its coming. As the rain arrives, Spidel can finally see how the woman escapes, a sense of joy flooding from present to past."

The poem uses an extended metaphor to describe the ever-changing nature of the speaker's relationship. The relationship is described as turbulent in one moment and beautiful and calm in the next. It is something that brings the speaker a great deal of pain and joy. It is “timeless” and “changing.” This suggests the speaker believes that the relationship is going to continue to change in the future. This isn't something she's dreading but something that she has embraced. You can listen to the full poem here.

'Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art' by John Keats begins with the speaker stating that he wants to be “stedfast” like a star. John Keats envies its sure and stable position from which it can see the earth in all its glory. From this description of the poem he moves then to the image of him, nestled in bed against the breast of his 'fair love'. The implication is clearly that he would like to preserve this moment forever, just as the star remains fixed in its eternal spot. Moreover, the poet immediately goes back on the first statement and gives the reader several reasons why he does not want this. The most important of these is that the stars are alone. They do not have anything to occupy their minds besides the troubles of humans down below nor do they have true companions. Hence they are alone and cold in the dark. As the poem continues, the speaker describes how he wants to take on a star's steadfast position so that he might stay with his lover. He is happiest with his head “Pillow'd” on her breast and intends to live there in his emotions for the rest of time."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that the two are doing everything they can to “keep” one another past the natural ending of this moment and their greater love affair. They both know that the emotions they are experiencing are limited. At some point, the moment is going to end and they are going to have to go back to the real world. In the next section, the speaker describes the highs and lows of their “moment.” They feel an unlimited passion for one another. Sometimes though it is tinted by anger, false promises, and feelings of revenge. These equally passionate emotions define their relationship as much as the positive ones do. "

‘Warm Summer Sun’ by Mark Twain is a poem that expresses the process of aging and life, all the way to life’s final moments. The wording involved in this representation of life shows that the journey does come with hardships, but it is a beautiful concept. The quickness of the poem mimics, as well, the rapid speed that life can take, so underneath the wonder expressed regarding life, there is also the caution to hold to it fully since it can prove fleeting. From beginning to end, though, the beauty of life remains a grounding theme to this poem."

The poem begins with the speaker describing how she is grieving but is unable to show it. She is restricted by her position, whether that be as Queen of England, as the poet was, or as a woman, from showing her true emotions. She is always two things at once: talkative and mute, cold and hot, in love and full of hate. The speaker has an inner self she is unable to acknowledge. In the second stanza she mourns the fact that even though this person is gone, she is unable to stop feeling for him. She can't get a hold of the cares in her life enough so that she may control them. They run from her, and continuously haunt her as she tries to find some peace. In the final stanza, she asks that she no longer be kept in this liminal place between love and hate. She wishes that her lover either scorn her, or act gentler towards her as her current state of being is untenable. By the end, she has come to the conclusion that there is no way her for to rid herself of her cares. They will stay with her until her death."

Oh! Surrey twilight! importunate band!
Oh! strongly adorable tennis-girl's hand!

Around us are Rovers and Austins afar,
Above us the intimate roof of the car,
And here on my right is the girl of my choice,
With the tilt of her nose and the chime of her voice.

And the scent of her wrap, and the words never said,
And the ominous, ominous dancing ahead.
We sat in the car park till twenty to one
And now I'm engaged to Miss Joan Hunter Dunn.","Miss Joan Hunter Dunn, Miss J.Hunter Dunn, Furnish'","'A Subaltern's Love Song' by John Betjeman is a humorous, upbeat poem that tells of the real-life love the poet had for Miss Joan Hunter Dunn. The poem begins with the speaker exclaiming over how much he cares for Dunn, and the joy he gets from playing tennis with her. She always wins, and while this sometimes makes him sad, it more than often makes him “glad.” She wins skillfully and “gaily.” After playing tennis on this particular day, the two go around the house and have drinks while watching the news. They are staying in a large house which is clearly owned by Dunn's family. After this, they get ready to go out. They're going to a dance at a Golf Club, and are getting into their best clothes. The speaker struggles with his tie, and then describes the surroundings of the house. There are a number of trophies in Dunn's room, and clothes on the floor. He ends up waiting for her at the bottom of the stairs and they drive together to the club. The speaker is very excited by the prospect of the evening, but even more so by the fact that he is with Dunn. Rather than go inside though, it appears that the two stay in the car talking. This leads to the last line, announcing that they got engaged."

through the perfume aisles at Saks, she held me up
by my arm, hissing, “Stand up,”
through clenched teeth, her eyes
bright as a dog’s
cornered in the light.
She said it over and over,
as if she were Jesus,
and I were dead. She had been
solid as a tree,
a fur around her neck, a
light-skinned matron whose car was parked, who walked on swirling
marble and passed through
brass openings—in 1945.
There was not even a black
elevator operator at Saks.
The saleswoman had brought velvet
leggings to lace me in, and cooed,
as if in the service of all grandmothers.
My grandmother had smiled, but not
hungrily, not like my mother
who hated them, but wanted to please,
and they had smiled back, as if
they were wearing wooden collars.
When my legs gave out, my grandmother
dragged me up and held me like God
holds saints by the
roots of the hair. I begged her
to believe I couldn’t help it. Stumbling,
her face white
with sweat, she pushed me through the crowd, rushing
away from those eyes
that saw through
her clothes, under
her skin, all the way down
to the transparent
genes confessing.","My grandmother dragged me through the perfume aisles at Saks, she held me u","'The Weakness' by Toi Derricotte describes an old woman and her granddaughter's hesitations in public due to their skin color. The speaker of this poem shares her childhood experience of going to the Saks departmental store. She hesitates to share the details except for her grandmother's reaction on that day. Her grandmother dragged her through the perfume aisles and repeatedly told her to get up in utter humiliation. The speaker could not disobey her order, yet she clung to her problems. Then, she was dressed into tight leggings and dragged away from the store. What her grandmother felt on that day is described in this poem."
580,580,580,"A voice said, Look me in the stars
And tell me truly, men of earth,
If all the soul-and-body scars
Were not too much to pay for birth.","A voice said, Look me in the stars and tell me truly, men of earth, If","A Question Analysis A voice said, Look me in the stars And tell me truly, men of earth, If all the soul-and-body scars Were not too much to pay for birth. No need to do a verse-by-verse analysis of 'A Question' — this is the entire poem. And despite its small size, it says a lot. At its face value, the poem can be read and understood fairly easily. How might one weigh the tragedies of life against its potential and its opportunities? If the human soul originates in a place where there is no pain — God, Heaven, or whatever it is you believe in, if you do believe in those concepts — then how can the silence of nonexistence compare to the pains of life? It's a highly philosophical and very abstract question. Who the voice in the stars in is unidentified; were the “m” in “me” capitalized, we could safely assume the voice is God, but it seems likely this is intentionally kept ambiguous. Still, to assume it is God or a God-like figure would make sense as a concept, but the point of the poem is, as the title suggests, the question itself. Are all the soul-and-body scars too much to pay for the life that deals them? And, in a much darker image, what if the answer to the question is “no?” As a commentary on life, we can see the narrator wondering to themselves what it is they get from living that makes it worth the pain, and the fact that the poem ends there indicates what a difficult question it is to answer. The poem also suggests that this suffering is destiny — discussing pain as an “entry fee” for living suggests that no matter who you are or where you're born, it is likely that you will find yourself questioning whether living is quite worth the pain associated. On the other hand, this makes perfect sense as an analysis — everyone experiences pain at some point or the other. Personal loss, grief, tragedy; in a sense, these are destiny, and that seems to be what this poem is getting at. And in those moments of suffering, we have to be able to remember the best parts of our life and remember that there is light that makes our lives worth living, and that makes our suffering worth enduring."

For blissful dreams may then arise,
Revealing to my charmed sight

Instead of solitude and woe.

The narrator — presumably Anne Brontë herself — expresses a very specific emotion that the nighttime brings out. It is a strange combination of solitude, loneliness, and comfort, coupled with what appears to be heartsickness. It is a complicated poem, for all its simplicity, because of how intensely it examines the emotion."

Cummings is a complex poem that depicts the life and death of “anyone” and “noone”. In the first stanza of the poem, the speaker introduces a man named “anyone” who lived in an ordinary town filled with the chiming of bells. He moved through life honestly, always aware of everything he'd left undone, and happy to celebrate the things he had accomplished. Despite his seemingly good nature, noone in the two “both little and small” cared for “anyone” at all. They cared only for themselves and continued to plant and harvest in that way. The speaker goes on to introduce “noone” a woman who lived in the same area and loved anyone. The relationship was at first interesting for the children, but they soon forgot about it despite the growing love noone had for anyone. Noone was well aware of everything anyone was feeling. Anyone eventually died as did noone. The townspeople who'd been concerned with their own lives, took the time to bury them next to one another. The poem concludes with an emphasis on the cyclical nature of life and the birth of the next generation of townspeople."

The poem begins with the speaker declaring that he's no longer going to fight his fate. He's going to sit back and wait for it to come to him. He knows, as he repeats throughout the entire poem, that there is nothing he can do to change the future. He should just accept it and know that good things are coming. He's lived a good life, he implies, and will therefore be rewarded."

The poem begins with the speaker telling of Christopher's illness and how his parents put him to bed. He was suffering from what sounds like a cold but his parents get very upset, imagining that it was something worse. They consult with a number of doctors who make the situation out to be even more complicated and nonsensical than it already is. By the end of the poem, it is clear that Christopher is all better and is planning the next thing he's going to do to “amuse” his parents."

She tells the reader and her intended listener that what she is talking about is not “poetry” or “art”. It is not made entirely clear who she is speaking about, but it is likely the people who make art and poetry. She does not want her people mistreated. Their “horizons,” representing hope and the future, are not going to be hacked away on her watch. She plans to chronicle whatever happens to them, just as their graves will. In the last stanza, she tries to make sense of what, presumably writing and art are for “[her] people”. They are vices similar to the desire to win trophies and be around horses. They are related to food and music, as well as dancing and power. Her people are more like scientists than artists."

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins by stating that there are times when they need to shoot a hippopotamus. This is a surprising line that is supposed to inspire the reader to continue through the next three lines to find out what situations the speaker finds themselves in. Rather than illuminating the kind of life they lead further, the speaker says that they have to use “platinum” bullets because “lead” ones are only going to flatten on the animal's hide. This is an example of a hyperbolic statement that's created in order to make the poem more humorous."

She feels like they are no different. They are one. There are no such materialistic things that can be compared with their feelings for one another. The poet has a thirst for the love of his husband and his heart has the thing the poet longs for. In fact, by writing this verse Anne Bradstreet wants to immortalize her love for her husband. As poetry is something that outlives men, their love will remain forever in these lines of the poem. 'One day I wrote her name upon the strand' by Edmund Spenser also says the same thing at its end."

'No Problem' by Benjamin Zephaniah says that the poet is not a problem in a white-dominated society. It's their problem that they can't accept the poet as he is. His color isn't the actual problem, it's the mindset that sees the only color. That divides humans according to their speaking style, origin, and bodily characteristics. The poet goes beyond such discriminatory thoughts and welcomes an air of individual freedom in his poem. He proclaims himself as a “versatile” person who wanted to teach the things he knew. But, “they” rejected the overall person for his 'black” identity. The poet doesn't mind it and shows his love for the country without any disgrace to her. He doesn't even hate white men. That's why some of the “best friends” of the poet “are white”. "

Eventually, the woman comes to the window, and the whole mood of the poem changes. She apologizes for not having set out the milk cans the night before.

590,590,590,"To him who in the love of Nature holds Communion with her visible forms, she speaks A various language; for his gayer hours She has a voice of gladness, and a smile And eloquence of beauty, and she glides Into his darker musings, with a mild And healing sympathy, that steals away Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts Of the last bitter hour come like a blight Over thy spirit, and sad images Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall, And breathless darkness, and the narrow house, Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;— Go forth, under the open sky, and list To Nature’s teachings, while from all around—
Earth and her waters, and the depths of air—
Comes a still voice—
Yet a few days, and thee The all-beholding sun shall see no more In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground, Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears, Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again,
And, lost each human trace, surrendering up Thine individual being, shalt thou go To mix for ever with the elements, To be a brother to the insensible rock And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould. Yet not to thine eternal resting-place Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down With patriarchs of the infant world—with kings, The powerful of the earth—the wise, the good, Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past, All in one mighty sepulchre. The hills Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun,—the vales Stretching in pensive quietness between; The venerable woods—rivers that move In majesty, and the complaining brooks That make the meadows green; and, poured round all, Old Ocean’s gray and melancholy waste,— Are but the solemn decorations all Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun, The planets, all the infinite host of heaven, Are shining on the sad abodes of death, Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread The globe are but a handful to the tribes That slumber in its bosom.—Take the wings Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness, Or lose thyself in the continuous woods Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound, Save his own dashings—yet the dead are there: And millions in those solitudes, since first The flight of years began, have laid them down In their last sleep—the dead reign there alone.
So shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw In silence from the living, and no friend Take note of thy departure? All that breathe Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh
When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care Plod on, and each one as before will chase His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave Their mirth and their employments, and shall come
And make their bed with thee. As the long train Of ages glide away, the sons of men, The youth in life’s green spring, and he who goes In the full strength of years, matron and maid, The speechless babe, and the gray-headed man— Shall one by one be gathered to thy side, By those, who in their turn shall follow them.

He spends time describing the long history of death and the many wise and important men and women who already reside there. You, the speaker says, will rest alongside them at peace with the world. The earth, which once nurtured you, will reclaim your body. The speaker explains how the world of the dead vastly outnumbers the world of the living and that it is better to live accepting death rather than fighting against it. This is the only way to enter into death well."

In the first stanza of 'Harlem Shadows,' the speaker begins by describing, using a first-person perspective, the sounds of a woman's footsteps. She's called “a lass” and described as moving through the “Negro Harlem.” It's dark out, and the speaker can also see other women walking. They're prostitutes, headed to “barter at desire's call.” The women work all night, without a chance to rest their feet. The poet paints a dark picture of this occupation and a sympathetic one of the women who are having to make money this way. The poet also makes it clear that these are Black women he's talking about. They are contrasted with the snowflakes and “earth's white breast.” The poem concludes when the speaker addresses the world and his “poor heart.” He describes how poverty and sorrow have been forced onto the feet of his race."

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker talks to a deceased fly that he's found crushed in a book. He interprets its death as accidental, as though someone closed the book on it without meaning to. Despite this, he marvels over the fly's wings and the imprint it left of its life. As the poem progresses, he turns to talk about human life and death and how everyone is going to get crushed in the book of death eventually. But, unlike the fly, humanity won't leave behind something as beautiful as the shimmer of the fly's wings on the book pages."
593,593,593,"A snake came to my water-trough
On a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,
To drink there.
In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob tree
I came down the steps with my pitcher
And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the trough
before me.
He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom
And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over
the edge of the stone trough
And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,
And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small clearness,
He sipped with his straight mouth,
Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,
Silently.
Someone was before me at my water-trough,
And I, like a second-comer, waiting.
He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,
And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,
And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused
a moment,
And stooped and drank a little more,
Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels
of the earth
On the day of Sicilian July, with Etna smoking.
The voice of my education said to me
He must be killed,
For in Sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold
are venomous.
And voices in me said, If you were a man
You would take a stick and break him now, and finish him off.
But must I confess how I liked him,
How glad I was he had come like a guest in quiet, to drink
at my water-trough
And depart peaceful, pacified, and thankless,
Into the burning bowels of this earth?
Was it cowardice, that I dared not kill him?
Was it perversity, that I longed to talk to him?
Was it humility, to feel so honoured?
I felt so honoured.
And yet those voices:
If you were not afraid, you would kill him!
And truly I was afraid, I was most afraid,
But even so, honoured still more
That he should seek my hospitality
From out the dark door of the secret earth.
He drank enough
And lifted his head, dreamily, as one who has drunken,
And flickered his tongue like a forked night on the air, so black,
Seeming to lick his lips,
And looked around like a god, unseeing, into the air,
And slowly turned his head,
And slowly, very slowly, as if thrice adream,
Proceeded to draw his slow length curving round
And climb again the broken bank of my wall-face.
And as he put his head into that dreadful hole,
And as he slowly drew up, snake-easing his shoulders,
and entered farther,
A sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into
that horrid black hole,
Deliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing
himself after,
Overcame me now his back was turned.
I looked round, I put down my pitcher,
I picked up a clumsy log
And threw it at the water-trough with a clatter.
I think it did not hit him,
But suddenly that part of him that was left behind convulsed
in an undignified haste,
Writhed like lightning, and was gone
Into the black hole, the earth-lipped fissure in the wall-front,
At which, in the intense still noon, I stared with fascination.
And immediately I regretted it.
I thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act!
I despised myself and the voices of my accursed human education.
And I thought of the albatross,
And I wished he would come back, my snake.
For he seemed to me again like a king,
Like a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld,
Now due to be crowned again.
And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords
Of life.
And I have something to expiate:
A pettiness.","A snake came to my water-trough On a hot, hot day, and I","'Snake' by D.H. Lawrence describes a speaker's various interactions with a snake that came to drink at his water-trough. The poem begins with the speaker describing coming upon the snake in his pyjamas. He was unprepared to see it but immediately happy it was there. Although pleased to see the animal, and more than willing to wait his turn, his inner voice was talking to him. The “voice of his education” was telling him to kill the snake—that he was only refraining from doing so because he was a coward. The speaker admits that he was frightened of the snake, but did not want to drive it away. He liked looking at it and felt honored that it had come to him. Finally, the snake stopped drinking and wriggled through a hole in the wall. The speaker didn't like to watch this happen and threw a log at the wall. This only causes the snake to disappear faster and makes the speaker feel regret for his petty action. This is something he says he has to atone for at the end of 'Snake.' Although Snake is quoted in full below, you can also read the poem at here."

The poem begins with the speaker sitting in a marketplace getting a henna tattoo from an “unknown girl,” this girl, like the speaker, is never named or described in greater detail. The speaker looks down at the peacock that has been “iced” onto her hand and then around at the shops. She feels a connection to the market stalls and mannequins in the shop windows with their western-style wigs. She wants to remember this moment, hold onto it, and force to it become part of herself. She looks forward in time and sees herself returning home with the henna tattoo, picking off the dark brown lines and watching the light brown markings fade over the next days. She will have a temporary connection to this place for which she will always yearn."

The poem begins with the speaker reflecting on the words of his child, or a child in his care. The child claims to be “rising five” rather than four years old. He is looking into the future, towards increased age, as a positive. This is something that scares the speaker and sends him into layers of contemplation about his environment and what it means to live. He looks around him and sees the landscape is gracefully changing. It is no longer winter, but “rising spring.” He broadens his view further, up to the sky, and sees that the sun is setting. The day no longer exists, it is “rising night.” In the final stanza, he reflects on how one considers the process of aging while young, and how that changes with marriage and parenthood. By the end of the poem he sees living not as life but as “rising death.”"

The song describes in sparse detail the lives of a joker and a thief. They are outside the walls of society and they know it. The former expresses concern over their life and what value there is in what they accomplish. Dylan's thief immediately calms him down and directs this short storyline towards its conclusion. The two riders are arriving at a walled castle of some kind. There, in a suspenseful atmosphere, something is going to happen."
598,598,598,"Ere on my bed my limbs I lay,
It hath not been my use to pray
With moving lips or bended knees;
But silently, by slow degrees,
My spirit I to Love compose,
In humble trust mine eye-lids close,
With reverential resignation
No wish conceived, no thought exprest,
Only a sense of supplication;
A sense o'er all my soul imprest
That I am weak, yet not unblest,
Since in me, round me, every where
Eternal strength and Wisdom are.

But yester-night I prayed aloud
In anguish and in agony,
Up-starting from the fiendish crowd
Of shapes and thoughts that tortured me:
A lurid light, a trampling throng,
Sense of intolerable wrong,
And whom I scorned, those only strong!
Thirst of revenge, the powerless will
Still baffled, and yet burning still!
Desire with loathing strangely mixed
On wild or hateful objects fixed.
Fantastic passions! maddening brawl!
And shame and terror over all!
Deeds to be hid which were not hid,
Which all confused I could not know
Whether I suffered, or I did:
For all seemed guilt, remorse or woe,
My own or others still the same
Life-stifling fear, soul-stifling shame.

So two nights passed: the night's dismay
Saddened and stunned the coming day.
Sleep, the wide blessing, seemed to me
Distemper's worst calamity.
The third night, when my own loud scream
Had waked me from the fiendish dream,
O'ercome with sufferings strange and wild,
I wept as I had been a child;
And having thus by tears subdued
My anguish to a milder mood,
Such punishments, I said, were due
To natures deepliest stained with sin,—
For aye entempesting anew
The unfathomable hell within,
The horror of their deeds to view,
To know and loathe, yet wish and do!
Such griefs with such men well agree,
But wherefore, wherefore fall on me?
To be loved is all I need,
And whom I love, I love indeed.","I lay on my bed my limbs I lay, It hath not been my","'The Pains of Sleep' by Samuel Taylor Coleridge describes a period in a speaker's life in which he is besieged by terrible imagery. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he has been lying in his bed for an extended period of time, unable to move. He does the only type of prayer he knows how, and turns his soul over from “reverential resignation” to “Love.” This action should cleanse his restlessness and purify the thoughts he's been having. As the poem continues on the speaker describes what the last two nights of his life have been like. He has seen a variety of terrible images that wake him screaming from sleep. All of these sights represent the horrors that mankind is capable of, and by default, the speaker himself. By the end of the piece, he is asking, almost desperately, why it is that he is the one who has to bear the responsibility of these images."

The poem begins with the speaker describing how her fingers resemble those of her father and her palms resemble her mother's. This is a fact that is deeply important to the speaker. It is this connection that allows her to feel that she is still a part of a cohesive family. These parts of her hands keep her family together even after they have split up. Her parents are no longer together, there is a lot of physical and emotional distance between them, but she keeps them connected through a “marriage” of fingers and palms. The speaker even goes so far as to create a marriage ceremony of sorts amongst all her fingers and her palms. Through this act, she is hoping to solidity their marital connection and family bonds. The poem concludes with the speaker considering a future child she could have with her partner and the history that will then be in that child's hands. She is ready to embark on this future, even though her own parents were unsuccessful."

Welcome to the silly, comforting poem.

It is not the sunrise,
which is a red rinse,
which is flaring all over the eastern sky;

it is not the rain falling out of the purse of God;

it is not the blue helmet of the sky afterward,

or the trees, or the beetle burrowing into the earth;

it is not the mockingbird who, in his own cadence,
will go on sizzling and clapping
from the branches of the catalpa that are thick with blossoms,
that are billowing and shining,
that are shaking in the wind.

2.

You still recall, sometimes, the old barn on your
great-grandfather's farm, a place you visited once,
and went into, all alone, while the grownups sat and
talked in the house.
It was empty, or almost. Wisps of hay covered the floor,
and some wasps sang at the windows, and maybe there was
a strange fluttering bird high above, disturbed, hoo-ing
a little and staring down from a messy ledge with wild,
binocular eyes.
Mostly, though, it smelled of milk, and the patience of
animals; the give-offs of the body were still in the air,
a vague ammonia, not unpleasant.
Mostly, though, it was restful and secret, the roof high
up and arched, the boards unpainted and plain.
You could have stayed there forever, a small child in a corner,
on the last raft of hay, dazzled by so much space that seemed
empty, but wasn't.
Then--you still remember--you felt the rap of hunger--it was
noon--and you turned from that twilight dream and hurried back
to the house, where the table was set, where an uncle patted you
on the shoulder for welcome, and there was your place at the table.

3.

Nothing lasts.
There is a graveyard where everything I am talking about is,
now.

I stood there once, on the green grass, scattering flowers.

4.

Nothing is so delicate or so finely hinged as the wings
of the green moth
against the lantern
against its heat
against the beak of the crow
in the early morning.

Yet the moth has trim, and feistiness, and not a drop
of self-pity.

Not in this world.

5.

My mother
was the blue wisteria,
my mother
was the mossy stream out behind the house,
my mother, alas, alas,
did not always love her life,
heavier than iron it was
as she carried it in her arms, from room to room,
oh, unforgettable!

I bury her
in a box
in the earth
and turn away.
My father
was a demon of frustrated dreams,
was a breaker of trust,
was a poor, thin boy with bad luck.
He followed God, there being no one else
he could talk to;
he swaggered before God, there being no one else
who would listen.
Listen,
this was his life.
I bury it in the earth.
I sweep the closets.
I leave the house.

6.

I mention them now,
I will not mention them again.

It is not lack of love
nor lack of sorrow.
But the iron thing they carried, I will not carry.

I give them--one, two, three, four--the kiss of courtesy,
of sweet thanks,
of anger, of good luck in the deep earth.
May they sleep well. May they soften.

But I will not give them the kiss of complicity.
I will not give them the responsibility for my life.

7.

Did you know that the ant has a tongue
with which to gather in all that it can
of sweetness?

Did you know that?

8.

The poem is not the world.
It isn't even the first page of the world.

But the poem wants to flower, like a flower.
It knows that much.

It wants to open itself,
like the door of a little temple,
so that you might step inside and be cooled and refreshed,
and less yourself than part of everything.

9.

The voice of the child crying out of the mouth of the
grown woman
is a misery and a disappointment.
The voice of the child howling out of the tall, bearded,
muscular man
is a misery, and a terror.

10.

Therefore, tell me:
what will engage you?
What will open the dark fields of your mind,
like a lover
at first touching?

11.

Anyway,
there was no barn.
No child in the barn.

No uncle no table no kitchen.

Only a long lovely field full of bobolinks.

12.

When loneliness comes stalking, go into the fields, consider
the orderliness of the world. Notice
something you have never noticed before,

like the tambourine sound of the snow-cricket
whose pale green body is no longer than your thumb.

Stare hard at the hummingbird, in the summer rain,
shaking the water-sparks from its wings.

Let grief be your sister, she will whether or no.
Rise up from the stump of sorrow, and be green also,
like the diligent leaves.

A lifetime isn't long enough for the beauty of this world
and the responsibilities of your life.

Scatter your flowers over the graves, and walk away.
Be good-natured and untidy in your exuberance.

In the glare of your mind, be modest.
And beholden to what is tactile, and thrilling.

Live with the beetle, and the wind.

This is the dark and nourishing bread of the poem."," The poem is not the world, but the world.</s","'Flare' by Mary Oliver is a beautiful poem that asks the reader to leave the past behind and live in the more important present. Throughout the twelve parts of 'Flare,' Mary Oliver's speaker, who is likely the poet herself, describes memories and images of the past. These are things which brought sorrow and pleasure. All of them are buried in a graveyard, one that she visited and then never went back to again. This is the proper way to deal with the past, she thinks. But it's not the way her “mother” or “father” did. They experienced sorrow throughout their lives and lived far too much in their lost dreams and regrets. This isn't how the poet, or, she thinks, the reader wants to live. She encourages everyone to seek out beauty in the natural world, embrace it, and allow it to bring one joy when sorrow seems like the easiest emotion to live in. Life is far too short, she concludes, to live in darkness."

Auden is all about taking risks in life and having an action-oriented mind. In this poem, Auden talks about how sometimes people should embrace uncertainty in life. His speaker refers to the very presence of danger in each step of life. It is crucial for his friend if he wants to do great things in his life. The way things are supposed to be done might not change, but the fear of doing something uniquely should be eliminated. People who constantly worry about the outcomes and take everything too seriously might not be able to live to the fullest. They fail to recognize the chances and restrain themselves due to their cautiousness. Furthermore, Auden comments upon society “consenting” to live as mere sheep. People tend to follow the flock or the way others lead their lives. They never take a route of their own. The speaker counsels against this mindset throughout the poem."

In modern times, people are obliged to be romantic as it does not come from the heart. Hence, the poet thinks otherwise. Everyone knows the rules that can be observed throughout the world. So modern lovers “have to be romantic” for the sake of pedantic customs. However, the speaker or the poet's persona says her love is “old and sure.” It's not new or frantic. Yet the speaker still feels the same vibes that she felt during the first few days of her relationship. For this reason, she says that the emotion lying at the deepest core of the heart makes her feel romantic, not Valentine's Day."

I admit: the same flow of gutter-sugar to the brain...


No one to see me off -- Ah!
I would like to be seen off; it must be the same agonizing woman
Who does not want to understand me, and who exposes me in public,
So that I can turn away, choked with the cold bile,
And feel myself loved absoltely; the bitch.


These carriages, that have heavy brown and black bread
Up their sides! But look out for the moment of cowardice,
It’s Charon’s rowing-boat that lurches and fouls my hand
As I climb on -- exile, Limboist.


...The way these people get on with thir lives; I bow down
With my few deeds and my lotus scars.
Last minutes...last greenish-yellow minutes
Of the lost and rotten hours...faro, and old winters dimmed,
On which the dark -- Yes, the black sugar-crust is forming, London.


I’m leaving! Nothing can hold me!
The trains, watered and greased, scream to be off.
Hullo -- I’m already sticking out my elbows for a piece of territory,
I occupy my place as though I can’t get enough of it
-- And with what casual, haughty, and specific gestures, incidentally.


Tradesmen, Pigs, regenerative trains -- I shall be saved!
I shall go to the centre of Europe; gliding,
As children skate on the diamond lid of the lake
Never touching gound -- Xenophile, on the blue-plated meadows.


Oh I shall live off myself, rainclothes, documents,
The great train simmers....Life is large, large!
...I shall live off your loaf of shadows, London;
I admit it, at the last.","I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving","Farewell to Kurdistan' by Rosemary Tonks is a sensorial poem that describes London and a speaker's departure from it. The poem takes the reader through a series of images associated with travel, specifically from a London train platform. The speaker depicts the space as dirty, smelly, and loud. It is somewhere she doesn't want to be, but at the same time is longing to be so that she may leave her current life behind. She alludes to her past but gives no concrete details about it. The train arrives, the platform goes into chaos, and she departs. The next sections of the poem speak about her excitement at being on the train and her desire to see other people and places."

grinding its teeth in a plastic sleeve, the chainsaw swung
nose-down from a hook in the darkroom
under the hatch in the floor. When offered the can
it knocked back a quarter-pint of engine oil
and juices ran from its joints and threads,
oozed across the guide-bar and the maker’s name,
into the dry links.

From the summerhouse, still holding one last gulp
of last year’s heat behind its double doors, and hung
with the weightless wreckage of wasps and flies,
moth-balled in spider’s wool…
from there, I trailed the day-glo orange power-line
the length of the lawn and the garden path,
fed it out like powder from a keg, then walked
back to the socket and flicked the switch, then walked again
and coupled the saw to the flex – clipped them together.
Then dropped the safety catch and gunned the trigger.
No gearing up or getting to speeds, just an instant rage,
the rush of metal lashing out at air, connected to the main.
The chainsaw with its perfect disregard, its mood
to tangle with cloth, or jewellery, or hair.
The chainsaw with its bloody desire, its sweet tooth
for the flesh of the face and the bones underneath,
its grand plan to kick back against nail or knot
and rear up into the brain.
I let it flare, lifted it into the sun
and felt the hundred beats per second drumming in its heart,
and felt the drive-wheel gargle in its throat.

The pampas grass with its ludicrous feathers
and plumes. The pampas grass, taking the warmth and light
from cuttings and bulbs, sunning itself,
stealing the show with its footstools, cushions and tufts
and its twelve-foot spears.

Probably all that was needed here was a good pull or shove
or a pitchfork to lever it out at its base.
Overkill. I touched the blur of the blade
against the nearmost tip of a reed – it didn’t exist.
I dabbed at a stalk that swooned, docked a couple of heads, dismissed the top third of its canes with a sideways sweep
at shoulder height – this was a game.
I lifted the fringe of undergrowth, carved at the trunk –
plant-juice spat from the pipes and tubes
and dust flew out as I ripped into pockets of dark, secret
warmth.
To clear a space to work
I raked whatever was severed or felled or torn
towards the dead zone under the outhouse wall, to be fired.
Then cut and raked, cut and raked, till what was left
was a flat stump the size of a manhole cover or barrel lid
that wouldn’t be dug with a spade or prized from the earth. Wanting to finish things off I took up the saw
and drove it vertically downwards into the upper roots,
but the blade became choked with soil or fouled with weeds,
or what was sliced or split somehow closed and mended
behind, like cutting at water or air with a knife.
I poured barbecue fluid into the patch
and threw in a match – it flamed for a minute, smoked for a minute more, and went
out. I left it at that.

In the weeks that came new shoots like asparagus tips
sprang up from its nest and by June
it was riding high in its saddle, wearing a new crown.
Corn in Egypt. I looked on
from the upstairs window like the midday moon.

to try to forget.

The poem begins with the speaker going into detail about a chainsaw. He's preparing it for a task, and like a caged animal it is ready to let its anger loose on whatever source the speaker chooses. Armitage makes use of personification throughout this poem, using it to describe the chainsaw as a snarling dangerous animal, but also its victim, the pampas grass. This large plant is located somewhere in the speaker's yard and he's determined to use his very angry chainsaw to destroy it. At first, things seem to be going well. He attacks the plant with the machine and it is felled easily. It is compared throughout these stanzas to something weak, floral, and in the end feminine. It presents a striking contrast against the chainsaw which is all testosterone and unmanaged rage. Things take a turn towards the end of the poem when the only thing left is the base of the plant. The speaker can't get it ripped out of the ground so he sets it on fire. Unfortunately for him, the plant survives and by June it has regrown and nature has asserted its dominance once more over humankind."

Nurkse begins by focusing on the moments after the birth of Nurkse's child, holding his Only Child after her birth. He realizes she knows nothing, having just come from the place 'where there was no world', not even knowing 'what a voice was'. He cradles her as he looks at the newborn. The second stanza moves in the child having a voice, asking Nurkse to watch her while 'cartwheel, the skip, the tumble' happen. This second stanza child is demanding, finding her voice, and asking for her father's attention. The third stanza examines a scene in which father and daughter are on a seesaw, with Nurkse writing that she 'has power' to lift him off the ground. This is a metaphor for how influential his daughter has become in his life, able to lift him and control him, despite her 'tiny weight'. The poem is a tribute to parenthood."

The first line tells the reader, quite simply, that God made the fly in “his wisdom”. This sarcastic phrase is followed up by its second half in the second line. It adds that God “forgot” to tell humanity why he made this particularly annoying creature. Nash assumed, correctly, that the reader is going to understand the joke in these lines."

Towards him, then she turns away
Her small head, making warm display
Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway

And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword
Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad

His coming: he raises up my face to him

Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:
And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down

Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown

They go on to describe a honeysuckle plant seeking out her lover, a bird's marriage bed, and a shed. They speak on the movement of a farmer and a rabbit caught in a snare.

How easily the biggest coal block split
If you got the grain and hammer angled right.

The sound of that relaxed alluring blow,
Its co-opted and obliterated echo,
Taught me to hit, taught me to loosen,

Taught me between the hammer and the block
To face the music. Teach me now to listen,
To strike it rich behind the linear black.

Keeps coming at me, the first stone
Aimed at a great-grandmother's turncoat brow.

Inherited on my mother's side

The china cups were very white and big—
An unchipped set with sugar bowl and jug.
The kettle whistled. Sandwich and tea scone

When all the others were away at Mass
I was all hers as we peeled potatoes.
They broke the silence, let fall one by one
Like solder weeping off the soldering iron:
Cold comforts set between us, things to share
Gleaming in a bucket of clean water.
And again let fall. Little pleasant splashes
From each other's work would bring us to our senses.

So while the parish priest at her bedside
Went hammer and tongs at the prayers for the dying
And some were responding and some crying
I remembered her head bent towards my head,
Her breath in mine, our fluent dipping knives—
Never closer the whole rest of our lives.

Fear of affectation made her affect
Inadequacy whenever it came to
Pronouncing words 'beyond her'. Bertold Brek.
She'd manage something hampered and askew
Every time, as if she might betray
The hampered and inadequate by too
Well-adjusted a vocabulary.
With more challenge than pride, she'd tell me, 'You
Know all them things.' So I governed my tongue
In front of her, a genuinely well-
Adjusted adequate betrayal
Of what I knew better. I'd naw and aye
And decently relapse into the wrong
Grammar which kept us allied and at bay.

The cool that came off sheets just off the line
Made me think the damp must still be in them
But when I took my corners of the linen
And pulled against her, first straight down the hem
And then diagonally, then flapped and shook
The fabric like a sail in a cross-wind,
They made a dried-out undulating thwack.
So we'd stretch and fold and end up hand to hand
For a split second as if nothing had happened
For nothing had that had not always happened
Beforehand, day by day, just touch and go,
Coming close again by holding back
In moves where I was x and she was o
Inscribed in sheets she'd sewn from ripped-out flour sacks.

The ceremonies during Holy Week

And rubrics for the blessing of the font.
As the hind longs for the streams, so my soul. . .
Dippings. Towellings. The water breathed on.
The water mixed with chrism and with oil.
Cruet tinkle. Formal incensation

Almost than in all their life together.

She could not hear but we were overjoyed.
He called her good and girl. Then she was dead,

Into us to keep, it penetrated
Clearances that suddenly stood open.
High cries were felled and a pure change happened.

Utterly empty, utterly a source

Accurate cut, the crack, the sigh
And collapse of what luxuriated
Through the shocked tips and wreckage of it all.

Dylan's song describes how the things happening around the world pains a speaker deeply. This speaker belongs to the century when discrimination according to color and origin existed, basic human rights were denied, and above all the harrowing air of war was raging everywhere. In such a critical situation, a speaker asks several questions to his fellow human beings. It seems everyone knows the answer to his simple questions, yet they are ignoring reality. For example, he alludes to the World Wars in the first stanza and asks how long this problematic situation is going to exist. In the following stanzas, he taps on the issues of racism, confinement, ignorance, freedom, death, and distress."

He comes across as having a bad experience with love that has punished him with feelings of remorse and pain come across in this poem. With this pain, Hardy personified Love so that he can take out the pain on the personification of Love. “Love” appears to him as an unkind man who once showed him the positive sides of it. But, now as he has lost his wife, it is giving him extreme distress. He tells love to leave at once and relieve him from the pain he is suffering after the loss of his dear one."

Can judge of love, thou feel’st a lover’s case,

To me that feel the like, thy state descries.
Then, even of fellowship, O Moon, tell me,
Is constant love deemed there but want of wit?
Are beauties there as proud as here they be?
Do they above love to be loved, and yet
Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess?
Do they call virtue there ungratefulness?"," The poem is a poem of love, and a poem of sorrow.</s","Sonnet 31 Analysis With how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb'st the skies! How silently, and with how wan a face! What, may it be that even in heav'nly place That busy archer his sharp arrows tries! Sure, if that long-with love-acquainted eyes Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case, I read it in thy looks; thy languish'd grace To me, that feel the like, thy state descries. The octet depicts the lyrical voice's perception of the moon. The poem starts by describing how the moon rises in the sky at night. The lyrical voice personifies the moon (“O Moon, thou climb'st the skies!) and projects his/ own sorrows in the moon (“With how sad steps”). The lyrical voice describes the moon carefully, as an individual being: “How silently, and with how wan face!”. There is a repetition of the word “how” in order to emphasize the lyrical voice's attention to the object that he is describing. The lyrical voice questions about the moon's sadness, and figures that it must be because of “What, may it be that even in heav'nly place /That busy archer his sharp arrows tries” (cupid). The lyrical voice's connection of his feelings to those of the moon is an example of a “pathetic fallacy”, where elements of nature appear to have human emotions. The lyrical voice suggests that the moon is struggling with sentimental problems, as he can see them from experiencing them himself: Sure, if that long-with love-acquainted eyes /Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case”. This furthers the personification and the “phatetic fallacy” mentioned before. The lyrical voice can “read it in thy looks” and the moon appears to be, again, weak (“thy languish'd grace”). This portrait of the moon shows the lyrical voice's assurance about the moon being lovesick. Once again, the lyrical voice compares the moon's state to his, making a direct relationship between the moon's suffering and his (“To me, that feel the like, thy state descries”). Notice how the unusual syntax accentuates the words of suffering that the lyrical voice is expressing. Then, ev'n of fellowship, O Moon, tell me, Is constant love deem'd there but want of wit? Are beauties there as proud as here they be? Do they above love to be lov'd, and yet Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess? Do they call virtue there ungratefulness? The sestet presents a series of questions that are crucial to the lyrical voice. The focus of the poem shifts from the description of the moon to the lyrical voice's reflections about love. This is the typical volta, turn, that occurs in the Petrarchan sonnet. The lyrical voice asks the moon (“Then, ev'n of fellowship, O Moon, tell me”) whether, in the sky, love is treated as “want of wit”. Moreover, he asks if women are as proud as they are on earth (“Are beauties there as proud as here they be?”). This series of questions project problems that the lyrical voice is dealing with. The lyrical voice in 'Sonnet 31′ still has more questions. He wants to know whether the things above like to be loved. Notice the internal rhyme in the fourth line. Moreover, he wants to know if the beloved ones like the ones who are in love with them (“Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess? “). Again, the lyrical voice is questioning and thinking about his own sentimental struggles and his relationship with Stella. The final line continues with the questions and the complaints that the lyrical voice has expressed in the sestet. The lyrical voice asks whether “above” love is despised to (“Do they call virtue there ungratefulness?”). He feels that love is a virtue, but it sounds like his beloved one, Stella, doesn't feel the same way about the lyrical voice's display of virtue and constant love. The tone of the sestet shows that the lyrical voice is deeply wounded and the rhetorical questions accentuate this pain."

In the first part of the poem, the poet outlines all the wildlife and how each living creature is reacting to spring. He uses examples of personification and anaphora to emphasize how the entire world seems to be shedding the winter and embracing spring. But, as he reveals in the concluding couplet, the season is not uplifting him in the same way. His sorrow is only growing worse because of the beauty and joy he sees around him."

Passage to India begins with a description of the new marvel of the modern world and how they are part of God's plan. These works, the Suez Canal, the great American Railway, and the transatlantic cable allowed men and women to know one another in a new way. He sees India as a mysterious and fabled place that once visited, will allow the rejuvenation of his soul. He will return to the birthplace of mankind and be renewed for the rest of his life. The Passage to India is not easy, many have died on the way. That scares the speaker, but not so much so as to deter him from undertaking the voyage. The pull of exploration is like a current running through the human race and he is a part of it and wants to feel the connectivity of the earth. The speaker also takes the time to mourn the downfall of men, like Columbus, who ended their lives unhappily. He imagines that he is on this important journey with his soul and that the two of them are circumnavigating the earth together. After asking himself if he is ready to go further on his journey, the reply is an eventual yes and he commands the anchor to be lifted. While the voyage might seem like a terrifying one, he is protected by God."

The speaker begins 'His Return to London' by stating that he is on a journey from the west to the east. This is a trip that he is relishing. It is taking him from somewhere dark and dreary, to somewhere bright and pregnant with possibility. In fact, London is so special to him, that he sees it as a place of nativity. It is important to him, just like one's spiritual or religious beliefs would be. In the next lines, he celebrates the fact that there are so many different kinds of people in the country. At the same time, he speaks directly to the citizens telling them that London is his home, but something happened that sent him into banishment. Now, he has been called back to his country. He is ready to remain there permanently until he dies. He feels that this will not be too long from now, and hopes that he can be buried in the London ground."

622,622,622,"Throughout the afternoon I watched them there,
Snow-fairies falling, falling from the sky,
Whirling fantastic in the misty air,
Contending fierce for space supremacy.
And they flew down a mightier force at night,
As though in heaven there was revolt and riot,
And they, frail things had taken panic flight
Down to the calm earth seeking peace and quiet.
I went to bed and rose at early dawn
To see them huddled together in a heap,
Each merged into the other upon the lawn,
Worn out by the sharp struggle, fast asleep.
The sun shone brightly on them half the day,
By night they stealthily had stol’n away.

And suddenly my thoughts then turned to you
Who came to me upon a winter’s night,
When snow-sprites round my attic window flew,
Your hair disheveled, eyes aglow with light.
My heart was like the weather when you came,
The wanton winds were blowing loud and long;
But you, with joy and passion all aflame,
You danced and sang a lilting summer song.
I made room for you in my little bed,
Took covers from the closet fresh and warm,
A downful pillow for your scented head,
And lay down with you resting in my arm.

The first of the two sonnets focuses on a snowfall, something he compares to “snow-fairies” fighting for supremacy in the sky and then resting peacefully on the ground. He uses personification throughout the piece, until the end when they've “gone,” or melted away. In the second sonnet, the speaker picks his line of thought immediately back up with the word “And.” It appears that the first sonnet has led him to the thoughts he has in the second. He imagines “you,” an unknown listener and the speaker's lover, coming to him and bringing warmth and summer into his home. Together, the two go to bed. When he wakes up, this person is gone as if they left with the dawn as a dream."
623,623,623,"First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1932
This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper.
So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear
itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to
convert retreat into advance... In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our
common difficulties. They concern, thank God, only material things...
More important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of
existence, and an equally great number toil with little return. Only a foolish optimist
can deny the dark realities of the moment.
Yet our distress comes from no failure of substance... Plenty is at our
doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply. Primarily
this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed, through
their own stubbornness and their own incompetence... This nation asks for action,
and action now.
Our greatest primary task is to put people to work... It can be accomplished in
part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would treat
the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment,
accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our
natural resources...
...These measures, or such other measures as the Congress may build out of
its experience and wisdom, I shall seek, within my constitutional authority, to bring to
speedy adoption.
But in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these two courses,
and in the event that the national emergency is still critical... I shall ask the Congress
for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis—broad Executive power to wage
a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we
were in fact invaded by a foreign foe...","This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So,","This phrase, “nothing to fear but fear itself”, is a reference to the sensation of fear that is the worst enemy of humankind. It keeps one aback and troubles one’s soul. The worst form of fear is the gloomy thoughts that create an eerie atmosphere inside one’s mind. Through this phrase, the speaker, FDR, refers to this mental framework that should not be encouraged. As it has a disastrous effect on one’s courage and the nation’s progress as a whole. However, the phrase is paraphrased here and FDR included this rhetorically charged phrase in a different manner."

In the first part of the poem, Spender uses two refrains and several other lines to describe the death of a soldier who lost his life while fighting. His death was incredibly important to the poet's speaker. He emphasizes the watch the man had on his wrist as well. In the second septet, or set of seven lines, the speaker describes this one man's death, and the presence of his body brings sorrow to all those who observed it. The man is split from his comrades by the bullet and now proceeds on a lonely path toward death. In the final section of the poem, the speaker alludes to a friend that the deceased soldier left behind. This man is also marked forever by his friend's loss."

'The Harvest Moon' by Ted Hughes describes the appearance of the harvest moon in the sky as a “flame-red” object. Thereafter, the poet captures its movement across the sky and uses different literary devices to compare its changing beauty. He uses the images of “balloon” and “doubloon” for this purpose. The instruments mentioned in the first stanza of the poem captures the sound present in nature. After that, there is a reference to the people's activity during the harvest moon. They are pious about the autumnal full moon. Moreover, the third stanza, presents how the cows and sheep react while watching the moon. In the last stanza, the poet presents the main idea of the poem by personifying the “gold fields”."

The next lines of the poem make clear that it is time for a change. The residents of the Colonies have had enough, and are ready to fight, hand-to-hand if necessary, for what they want. In the last two stanzas of the poem, the speaker describes the dedication of the monument for which the poem was written. He asks God to spare the statue from any of the damages “Time” or “Nature” could inflict upon it as the generations to come to need to understand its importance."

The poem begins with the speaker asking his first question. He wants to know if the reader is aware of the fact that one” heart feels the most grief “at the fall of the leaf.” It is the days of autumn, particularly those which are edging on towards winter which is the hardest to live through. They are marked by an inescapable decay that makes its way through every living thing. In the second section, the speaker moves on to discuss the emotional and mental impacts of the changing season. One's mind will decay alongside one's body. It will be in vain to try to prevent this from happening or make any attempt to outlast it. He also states that this period of time will force one to watch their “joys” suffer. In the final set of five lines death is described as being preferable to the long decay of autumn. By the time the pain sets in, one will be ready to face death. It will be the more “comely” option between the two."

'King Lear' is a play about family and misery, duty and birthright, and how one's opinion can lead to tragedy. It is one of Shakespeare's most revered plays, played constantly over the years to crowds of packed audiences; and it is no secret why the play itself is one of Keat's favourites.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that while imprisoned in his cell his love comes to him and improves his situation. He imagines that his lover, Althea, visits him and takes his confinement away. His imaginings free him from the gates and grates which surround him. In the next section, he recalls moments of happiness drinking with others. These times brought him, and his friends, a freedom which was greater than that known by fish in the sea. They drink to the health of their king, a fact which contributed to the poet's imprisonment in the first place. In the last sections, he describes his ability to sing more shrilly than a “linnet.” This bird's song is not as sweet or loud as his is. His words will glorify the king and provide him with a freedom greater than that known by the winds which turn up a flood. The final lines return to the speaker's lover and he states that their love makes him freer than the angels which “soar” in the sky."

firetruck
moving
tense
unheeded
to gong clangs
siren howls
and wheels rumbling
through the dark city.",Among the rain and lights i saw the figure 5 in gold on a red fire,"The first thing, and also last thing, Williams focuses on within this poem is the atmosphere. The keywords from this descriptive field are 'rain', 'lights', 'rumbling', and 'dark city'. The description of the scene, although short, is a sensory overload. Williams hastens to fit in as many sights and sounds as he can during the 31 lines. By setting the poem within this rainy, dark city, the poem takes on an air of nostalgia. By not identifying the city, the reader can self-identify with the poem, reading it into a location of their choosing. Without the appearance of the firetruck, the scene is actually a little depressing. The focus on the 'rain' and 'dark' culminate into a dingy and washed-out image. The sudden appearance of the truck breathes life into the poem, searing itself on the memory of the reader. The lack of sound within the city is also evident by the appearance of the truck. The onomatopoeic 'siren howls' and 'wheels rumbling' culminate together to slice through the silence of the city. This moment, although only a flash is one that sensorially captivates the reader. The flash of 'red' and 'gold', searing as an image accompanying the loudness of the firetruck. This moment is temporary, yet very impactful. Perhaps here Williams is reflecting on the idea of memory, with this seemingly insignificant moment creating such a powerful image. This is supported by the odd elements which William writes, especially that of the number '5' seared onto his brain. It does not always have to be magnificent which is solidified in memory. Speed Movement is one of the key facets of 'The Great Figure.' The slow steadiness of the 'rain' and 'light' beginning the poem is contrasted against the sudden disruption of the firetruck. Interestingly, 'moving' is one of the only words in the poem that has a line to itself, elevating its importance. The fleeting nature of the firetruck can be linked to the transitory nature of time. This moment of explosive action speeds past us and then is gone. The firetruck comes into, and out of, sight in the blink of an eye. Williams could be suggesting that the fleeting nature of life needs to be focused on. Moments happen and then they are gone, most lost to forgetting. Perhaps William urges the reader to be more present, find the extraordinary within the ordinary."

The speaker begins by describing the purity of the moon's light and how on certain nights it is more meaningful than others. The night of this poem's telling is one such night. The light emerges from behind an apple tree, crosses the ocean, pauses for a moment on the sand of the shore, relishing in the solidity of the earth, and then begins to climb. The moonlight moves up a cliff face and then comes into contact with humanity. It is forced to travel through gash-like “quarries” and across the vast piles of waste humankind has discarded. It finally reaches the population of the earth and rests of the eyelids of all the sleepers, hoping to “amend” the actions of humanity. The purity of light is being wielded as a weapon for the good of the earth."

From thee I've heat and light,
Thy absence makes my night.
But ah! my Friend, it now grows very long,
The sadness weighty, and the darkness strong:
My tears (its dew) dwell on my cheeks,
And still my heart thy dawning seeks,
And to thee mournfully it cries,
That if too long I wait,
Ev'n thou may'st come too late,
And not restore my life, but close my eyes.
Rate this poem:","Observe the weary birds e're night be done, How they woul","'Orinda to Lucasia' by Katherine Philips describes the importance and intensity of the relationship she holds with her close friend, Anne Owens. The poem begins with the speaker describing what the world is like when it waits for the sun to rise. The night seems endless and the sun late to arrive in the sky. This intense wanting of light inspires the birds to cry out to the sky and the flowers to droop in sadness. Even the brook which should be fierce is mourning for the sun. The second stanza is directly related to the first as the speaker compares her friendship with Anne Owens to the sun. Owens, referred to as Lucasia in this text, is as critical to her survival as heat and light are to birds and flowers. For an unstated reason, the speaker and her friend are separated at this point and she knows she won't survive much longer without her. Even though it might be fruitless, she will continue to cry out, like the desperate birds of the first stanza, for Lucasia to return to her."

As the very title of the poem suggests itself that it is about the nostalgic feeling of childhood. The poet, comparing her childhood with the adulthood, says that her childhood was honest and innocent. Love in her childhood was neither complicated nor violently emotional. Remembering her childhood, the poet says that she could live her life as she wished.

On the contrary, her adulthood introduces her to the stony world which asks for meanings of everything. She says where her childhood was full of glittering life; her adulthood taught her about the clarity of life. She says where in her childhood she never felt to understand the meaning of love and other things, her adulthood taught her the reality of life, but she says she doesn’t need such clarity."

In the short lines of this poem, the speaker makes the argument that they deserve to be free and “stand” on the “land” as much as “you” do. They have thus far been denied equal rights but it's time for things to change. Incremental change, he adds, or the promise of change in the future is not enough. He and all those in the Black community (or anyone who has been disenfranchised for that matter) want and deserve the same rights as those in power."

Along the wharves by the,"'Shadwell Stair' by Wilfred Owen describes a haunted track of docks in London and the emotional turmoil of the ghost that frequents them. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is in fact a ghost, and spends his nights walking the “wharves” and “slaughter-house” around Shadwell Stair. He considers himself to be “the shadow” that walks and lives there. He continues on to state that while he may be a ghost, he is not without physical form. He still feels things, and his skin is cold to the touch. Additionally, he says that his eyes are like the reflections of lights in the water of the Thames. In the second half of the poem, the peaceful imagery has come to an end, and the speaker describes the turmoil he feels as night ends. He has walked until the stars are gone and conclude his wanderings by laying down beside another ghost. Explore more Wilfred Owen poems."

The poem begins with the speaker, a customer, asking a vendor what he is selling. This person gives him details regarding the turbans, rich mirrors, and daggers, as well as beautifully stitched tunics he has for sale. The text progresses quickly to the next stall where the same, or possibly a new, customer inquiries about the “lentils, rice” and spices being sold. Again, they receive an appealing description of the items. In the third stanza, the speaker becomes interested in what the “goldsmith” is making. This stanza is more in-depth as the goldsmith focuses on three different ways he treats gold. He is seeking to show off his products and his skill. He can hammer something thin enough for the leg of a pigeon, or forge something sturdy enough for a king. In the fourth stanza, the speaker inquires about three different types of instruments and fruits. These products almost all originate from the Indian subcontinent and are added into the piece in order to further praise the Indian culture. The final stanza describes in greater detail than any of the previous stanzas what the materials for sale are going to be used for. In this section, the speaker asks “flower-girls” what they are weaving. They respond by describing the creation of a crown for a bridegroom and a shroud for someone recently deceased.

She goes on to list out a number of features, experiences, and forces of the world she loves the most.

She begins We Alone with a strong statement and one that makes the reader stop and ponders the power of the human race. With these lines of We Alone, the speaker communicates to the reader that these musings are a possibility if only everyone would agree to act. The speaker claims that it “could be our revolution” to end the struggle for money and power and begin to value moments of connections with nature and other human beings. The speaker finally expresses a final thought on all that humankind values. She reveals that the revolution could finally happen when people would learn “to love what is plentiful as much as what is scarce”. Thus the speaker presents the idea that human love is what is behind the way the world works. Because we love power and material wealth, we place value on what is rare. However, if we could together agree to love all that nature has to offer, whether scarce or plentiful, we would surely enjoy a more thorough life. Although the reality of this kind of shift taking place is nearly impossible, the words do cause the reader to venture into self reflection and to ponder what true value is. The reader is moved to question his own motives and values as they determine the course of his life.

Williams takes the season and plays with the “pageantry” of everything associated with it. There are people working, all to the benefit of themselves. In the next lines, he draws a reader's attention to another part of the scene. The young man, Icarus, has flown too close to the sun and is now drowning in the bay.

Starting from the inside of the wolf's fang which is purple as heather. The inside of the heather looks like the wolf's fur. The inside of the wolf's fur is reminiscent of the old and grotesque forest resembling the wolf's foot. Its foot, in turn, calls for a comparison to the stony horizon (marks the path of the wolf that it has to tread along until it chances upon its prey in a doe), for the wolf's foot is as hard as stone (Thanks to the long walks!). The stony horizon besides looking like the foot also looks like the tongue of the wolf. Its tongue is as hard as stone (this is one hungry wolf!). The wolf's tongue salivating looks much like the doe's tears. And the doe's tears are hard like the frozen swamp (wolf sure won't fall for tears and won't give up on treating itself to a doe dinner!). The frozen swamp, suggestive of the wolf's inconsiderate and cold attitude, has in it the doe's tears. The blood only next to the attitude of the wolf is chilled. It is chilled by the snow wind as the wolf marches through its habitat for food. As its walk progresses, the wolf looks at the North star hoping it would guide him to his next prey. As he looks at the star one could see his eyes gleam like the star. It may be just a reflection of the star on the eyes of the wolf or it could be the passion of the wolf accelerated by its appetite.

We people on the pavement looked at him:
He was a gentleman from sole to crown,
Clean favored and imperially slim.

And he was always quietly arrayed,
And he was always human when he talked,
But still he fluttered pulses when he said,
""Good-morning,"" and he glittered when he walked.

And he was rich--yes, richer than a king--
And admirably schooled in every grace:
In fine, we thought that he was everything
To make us wish that we were in his place.

And went without the meat and cursed the bread;

Went home and put a bullet through his head.

The fact that the rhythm and rhyme are so consistent throughout makes the revelation at the end of stanza four all the more shocking. There is almost a conversational tone to the poem. The frequent use of ‘and’ adds to this effect, loading detail upon detail as the speaker tells the sorry tale of Richard Cory."

And she’s looking and calling for you.","The red crashing game of a fight?

The speaker directly addresses the young men of her country, trying to goad them into showing their strength and bravery by joining the armed forces. She refers to war as a “game,” one that's important for them to participate in and see if they can win."

It at once stresses how slow time passes, and how quickly the seasons can change. This focus on the progression of time demonstrates that although some moments are slow and some are fast, time never stops moving. The poem interacts with characters from the city, focusing on activities that the 'junkies' and 'ghetto musicians' do to pass the time within spring. For a poem which is addressing Spring, there is very little imagery of nature, instead of focusing more on the city and its occupants. There is certain melancholia within the poem, the people described being unable to change or escape their circumstances, stuck in a cycle of waiting for the next season forever. "

The first stanza is the longest part of the poem and it is not a coincidence. It is a metaphor for the commandant's predominant personality traits and this is why it dominates so much of the poem's content. In the third stanza, the scene with his child represents a far smaller portion of the poem and this is a metaphor for his spark of humanity. The form of this piece is very clever as it creates a grim image, creates a glimmer of hope in the second and third stanzas, and then ends on a dour note emphasizing the futility of the situation."

We stopped there at an altar of rock and rested,
watching the dog shrink over the hill before continuing ourselves,
finding the slope steeper than expected.
A blade of wind from the east
and the broken stone giving under our feet
with the sound of a crowd sighing.
Half way up and I turned to look at you,
your bent head the colour of the rocks,
your breath reaching me, short and sharp and solitary,
and again I felt the tipping in the scales of us,
the intersection of our ages.
The dog returns having caught nothing but his own tongue
and you are with me again, so together we climbed to the top
and shared the shock of a country unrolled before us,
the hedged fields breaking on the edge of Wales.
Pulling a camera from my pocket I placed it on the trig point
and leant my cheek against the stone to find you in its frame,
before joining you and waiting for the shutter’s blink

us standing on the edge of the world, together against the view

This poem begins with a clear setting and location, December 27th, on Skirrid Hill. The two characters in the poem, the son, who is the speaker, and the father, in an attempt to become closer, are repeating an activity they must have once found enjoyable, climbing Skirrid Hill. The men do not seem to commune as they progress up the mountain but are consumed in their worlds. The climb is treacherous, but no one is hurt, the ground is steeper than they expected, but they make it to a resting spot. An altar that is “split…by a father's grief / at the loss of his son to man.” This is the reader's first hint as to why the two have grown apart. The son is aging, becoming his own man and the father does not know how to communicate with him anymore. As they continue to climb up the hill the son looks back at his father and can feel how he is breathing and connect those feelings to his own. This is a clue that the two are becoming more similar and this is what is taking them apart. They eventually make it to the top of the mountain and pose for a photo the son sets up. The son is seeking evidence or some kind of proof that they were here, that they did try to fix things. He hopes at this moment that they have made some kind of progress in improving their relationship, but that doesn't seem to be the case. "

The poem begins with the speaker telling the rose that she is sick. This sickness is caused by the “invisible worm.” The phallic-shaped worm comes to the rose at night in the middle of “the howling storm.” There is a real sense of danger and dread in these lines that only builds as the poem progresses and Blake makes use of enjambment. In the second stanza of ‘The Sick Rose,’ the worm finds the rose’s bed. The rose is afflicted with the worm’s “dark secret love” and has its life destroyed. The worm, which clearly represents a phallus, kills the rose—the woman’s, virginity."

The poem is a reaction piece, written by a speaker that is filled with anger over the atrocities committed by the Nazis, and more specifically man, during the holocaust. She speaks about her anger, and how it fills her daily; that death does not care about what’s happening and does not take those who really deserve it.

She spends the rest of the poem passing judgment on these men, deciding that they should no longer be worshiped like “temples” or have any agency in their own lives, all in an attempt to stop something like this from happening again. The speaker ends the poem by hoping that God has not heard all she has said allowed, perhaps fearing she is becoming like the men she condemns."

This poem is divided into two parts. In the first part, the speaker shares one of his childhood memories. One day, he was in his native place in Kentucky. There he stood by a road in utter darkness. The sky was dark due to the absence of the moon as well as the stars. He only heard the sound of geese migrating northwards. In the next part, the speaker asks readers to tell him a story. Before they can start, he defines what should be the theme of the tale. It must encompass the theme of distances. In modernity, there is nothing left to be talked about. That's why he tells them to share a story that can rejuvenate his weary mind. It should be a story of delight, not filled with the ravages of modern time."

The second stanza brings in a Spanish galleon and the gemstones this particular type of ship would've carried. These two different periods in history are juxtaposed with one another as well as with the final.

The poet begins by listing things that we must bring on the journey, building immersion into the metaphor before actually launching into it. This journey, it is revealed, is to self-satisfaction, happiness, and avoiding the 'abyss' of depression. It is not an easy journey to take, with Dunn's narrative weaving in and out of metaphor and the literal, the confusion adding a layer to the journey itself."

After gripping it in his hand, he looks around and comes across “crabs” and “dogfish” lying dead on the shore. The scene depicts the cruelty of the sea that topples lives. In the second stanza, the poet thinks about the jaw that he is holding. The jaw was active at a time but now it's of no use. Here on the shore, it lies with shells, skulls, claws, and other useless things.

Damp stools, and half-split open hassocks,
Here where the vicar never looks

Lean and alone I spend my days
Behind this Church of England baize.
I share my dark forgotten room
With two oil-lamps and half a broom.
The cleaner never bothers me,
So here I eat my frugal tea.

My jam is polish for the floor.

For congregations and for priests,
And so may Whitsun. All the same,

With ears of corn around the font.

To burrow through a loaf of bread.

And gnaw the marrows hanging there.

Come into church my food to share

Ate through the altar's sheaf of oats.

The poem comes from the perspective of a church mouse. This creature lives every day of the year within the confines of the church. He's often alone and starving, but he does not move anywhere else. He likes the church and is devoted to living there. He speaks about the different feasts that humans get to engage in and how they don't benefit him at all. But, there is one feast that is different. That is the Harvest Festival. When the church is filled with corn, wheat, gourds, and more, he's able to nibble and munch on these items until he's full. But, there's a catch. At this time of year, the church is invaded by other creatures, mice, and rats, that want to take advantage of this plethora of food. The speaker is clearly irritated by this fact and reminds the reader that he never goes into the fields of other mice and eats their food. They are well sustained all through the year and he isn't. The mice that come into the church once a year are compared to the human beings that do the same. He judges these mice for their selective attendance and is at the same time alluding to that same feature in human churchgoers."

The poet begins by describing a boat on the water. It moves with the tide, beautifully and powerfully at first (in the morning). Then, when the speaker comes back later, the water is gone and the boat is still there. The soul, as symbolized through the boat, remains, but the passion, symbolized through the water, is gone.

The speaker begins the text by trying to convey how beautiful the birds in the parrot house are. It's hard for him to find the right images to describe their colors and what they make him think of. There is an interesting transition in the middle of the poem when the speaker moves from admiring the parrots to using personification to describe them. The poet uses human-specific interactions and emotions to describe the parrots in less than complimentary detail. The poem concludes with the poet noting that although the parrots looked beautiful, many negative things were going on."

At the beginning of the poem, readers can visualize the trash pickers carefully picking up all the trash one by one, checking inside each trashcan, and talking with each other while listing the things they find. It is astounding that some people see things thought of as “trash” in a completely different light by others who pick up that castaway stuff. Old nails, old paper, crooked skillets, and more like objects find new importance having been picked up. Trash offers glimpses into someone's existence and simultaneously speaks a lot about the old owner. It also hints at the condition of the new owner who picks it up. Reading the last stanza, one can understand that the poem is not simply about trash pickers picking up trash. It has deeper layers where the poet observes the things well-off people leave behind, the lasting effect it has upon people and the earth, and how the poor people who pick up those trash stuff weave dreams around those rejected items."

The speaker of the poem knows, the long-lost “Freedom” has come again. Moreover, the Earl would end the tyrannical rule and bring happiness to all. Lastly, the poet compares him to Christ.

The speaker addresses a specific listener throughout this poem, someone who is likely their romantic partner. Or, at the very least, someone very close to them. They describe briefly the struggles that they went through to ensure that they created a future that was safe and clear for themselves and for their listener. The bulk of the poem is used to define the love between the two. It's a love that's existed since the beginning of time, the speaker says, and one that's going to last through any trials they might face. It's on this note that the poem ends."

According to him, it must be something new, something set upon real places, people, and events. It should not have inhibitions to address unpleasant subjects. Further, he wants Modern poetry to focus on the acts of the mind itself and expects it to help people find satisfaction in their lives itself. It further describes the new demands made on poetry by the complicated and skeptical age. The poet concludes by stating the possible subjects for poetry."

A private is singled out by Wilfred Owen, and a Sergeant, for having blood on his suit, although later he admits to Owen that the blood was his own. The poem begins directly with the conversation between a soldier and Owen's speaker. It seems he is the instructor of the parade. He is angry with a spot of blood on the soldier's uniform. Suddenly, the sergeant comes into the conversation and rebukes him for the misbehavior. The offender is confined in a camp as punishment. In the following stanzas, the poet features what the sergeant tells the speaker. He clarifies that blood is “dirt” to them. It hinders them from doing the main task they are entitled to do, which is spilling more blood. To do this task, they must be tidy enough, not bearing the stains of their past activities. Owen, pointing out that it is no excuse, is told by the soldier that the world itself doesn't like them being so alive, and that true justice will occur when they are all dead."

Over a course of fourteen lines, Helen Hunt Jackson covers the negative effects that dreams have on our lives. She specifically targets how dreams often revive the sorrowful memories of our past and in a way, make us relive the event that we were trying desperately to forget. A driving point in her poem is that we will carry sadness with us until we die. The poem ‘Dreams’ is rich with imagery, and imagery is the strongest device Jackson uses to highlight the main point of her poem. Despite the fact that the poem is entitled Dreams, it does not focus on the general essence of dreams. Jackson explicitly only targets the negative effects that dreams often have when we are compelled to remember our past through them.

Dreams are generally seen as positive, motivating tools that most people look forward to. Dreams are a synonym for goals and aspirations. However, in her poem, Jackson describes dreams as experiences that highlight depression and gloom. The title Dreams can be perceived as an oxymoron, because Jackson means for it to contradict itself. The entire poem can be seen as satirical in nature, because the content contrasts strongly with the selected title, almost in a mocking tone."

to an elephant's graveyard of cars,
a motorway pile-up in the corner of the field.

the commas and apostrophes

young as the buzzards above us

smashed black holes in the windows,
sat in the drivers' seats, going nowhere,
operated on engines,
dock-leaves and nettles running in their pistons
or just walked among them,
reading aloud from the names of the dead:

Volvo, Ford, Vauxhall,
Their primary colours rusting to red.
Where we lost ourselves in the hours before dark,
year on year, until that day
when life put on the brakes
and pitched you, without notice,
through the windscreen of your youth.

a poppy sown in the unripe corn.

I came back once, to find the cars smaller
or the undergrowth grown,
whichever, the whole diminished to steel and stone.
Just cars in a quarry,
their dashboards undone and the needles
of the speedos settled at zero.
As I climbed back out I disturbed a buzzard
that flew from its branch like a rag
shaken out in the wind,
before spiralling upwards
above the shuffling trees
and on over the fields —
the spittle sheep, the ink-dot cows,
a tractor writing with its wheels,
and on over the lanes, where a boy
meandered between the hedges,
trailing a stick, kicking a stone,
trying once more to find his way home.","The hummock of a grave, the headstone of trees, the wind-","Border Country' by Owen Sheers is a moving poem about childhood and how growing up can change one's perceptions about everything.

There, he used to play with his friends and explore their limited freedom. The poem also alludes to the loss of a friend's father, deep emotional trauma, and what it means to grow up and leave one's childhood behind. "

There is no time for them to strike camp, and there are also no kitchens for them to cook in. The speaker implies that they are being attacked and are forced to flee in their own lands. He is hoping to draw the reader's attention to the aggressive nature of the British forces. These lines also suggest that the rebellion is not as organized as it could be. In the second quatrain, the speaker notes that the soldiers do everything they can to fight off the British. Although they are disorganized, they continually try new tactics. These are not ultimately successful as the final lines discuss the slaughter of these men at Vinegar Hill. The poem ends on a hopeful note, suggesting that the men, or others like them, would in the future once more take up the cause and fight back against the oppressive British regime. "

He describes the way in which he believes that no matter what death brings, the soul will never be destroyed. Because of this, it is important to do all one can in life to make one's situation, and that of others, better.

He follows it up with a series of amusing and imaginative questions about angels, emphasizing the importance of having an individual relationship with religion. Collins’ concluding image of an angel dancing in the club suggests that heaven is found not in medieval thought experiments but in the beauty of ordinary life. Instead, he starts proposing more imaginative, even silly, questions about angels. These range from how they change color to what happens when they fall through clouds. He pushes back against the controlling nature of Christian tradition by imagining a single angel dancing in a jazz club, grounding his belief in the present moment."

The poem begins with the speaker professing his love for the listener by listing off her attributes. He has, in the past, seen her as being virtuous, gentle, and sweet. She was full of life and beauty that he loved and appreciated. Something has happened now though and she has become “merciless.” In the next section of the poem, the speaker describes following her into her garden and seeing her beautiful flowers. On top of the beauty is something poor-smelling, rue. The poem concludes with the speaker declaring the woman dead. It is unclear if she has in fact died or if he is so upset by the change in her that he has decided she is dead. Explore more poems from William Dunbar."

Strange,"Climbing her metaphorical hill, The Long Hill by Sara Teasdale focuses on the uncertainty about when one 'peaks' in life. Teasdale cannot see ahead or behind her, and is therefore disappointed to realize that she 'passed the crest' of her life 'a while ago'. The poet suggests that there is a moment in life when we all reach our 'peak', with everything else just 'going down'. Teasdale's attitude to life is depressing, but hauntingly realistic."

'Air Raid' has a rapid-fire opening. The poem immediately takes us to the war setting, where aircraft are literally reigning death on civilians. It doesn't mellow out in the second stanza. In fact, the poem brings us closer to the war using a mundane scenario of friends about to greet each other before one of them is sliced in half. Regardless, 'Air Raid' attempts to dissolve tension at its end by including dark humor. As the speaker says, the dead friend has other worries now than his friendly greeting."

Outside the window, they see an old woman, which bares incredibly resemblance to Teasdale herself. Teasdale looks at the features of the woman without love, her body seems to have withered away from lack of care. Although there are similarities between Teasdale and the old maid, Teasdale has had love in her life and is therefore healthy. The poem emphasizes the importance of love, suggesting it can physically make people healthier and happier. Knowing she has been in love, Teasdale is glad to realize that she will 'never be' this woman who looks so physically similar to her."

Besides, it aptly portrays human aspirations, pains, and hopes."

Lawrence begins by directly questioning the reader's authority on right and 'wrong'. The start of the poem is strange, Lawrence's use of the direct address seemingly angry and pointed. Considering this is a poem about love, it is only right that Lawrence draws upon further strong emotions, dictating to the reader that he will be telling the story, no one else. How he decides to live his life is up to him, 'I am not wrong'. Lawrence takes us on a journey around three cities, 'Syracuse', 'Venice', and 'Tuscany' in order to compare the differing Pomegranates that he finds in each of the locations. This symbol of the pomegranate can be understood as a metaphor for love, Lawrence connecting the red heart and the deep red color of the pomegranate. The final image of the poem focuses on how Lawrence 'prefer[s] my heart to be broken', as in line with a pomegranate, a fissure allows for one to see 'within the crack'."

Thus, at the beginning of each stanza Natten constantly asks himself, “When did my childhood go?” He is confused about when he ceased to be a child. As an adult, he feels dejected to think about the loss of innocence in him. Those things which once amused him like the thoughts of “Hell and Heaven”, are now faraway dreams. Everything has changed around him. His parents don't love him in the way they did before. The poet has become egocentric. He only thinks about himself, unlike a child. Presently, he is only left with his musings on childhood. He thinks childhood might have gone to a distant land. At last, he gets his answer after seeing an infant's face. The sight gives him a sense of relief to think that it has gone nowhere."

Edith Sitwell’s best-known work is the one produced during the Second World War. Most of her work focuses on themes such as mortality, time, consciousness, and love. ‘Heart and Mind’, particularly, explores the passion and its difference from the traditional idea of true love. Moreover, the poem considers physical and spiritual existence to question this idea of love and mortality.

The poem is written in free verse form. It has four stanzas with eight, five, four, and five lines respectively. As a free verse poem, ‘Heart and Mind’ doesn’t have a particular rhyme scheme. Nevertheless, enjambment can be read in the poem, and there is a great use of allegorical figures. The tone of ‘Heart and Mind’ is reflective and it has a surreal and fantastical mood."

In this one-stanza work, Hopkins utilizes the reaction of a young girl named Margaret to express a deep-rooted fear that humans carry throughout their lives, expressly that of their own mortality. What seems like a simple account of a girl “grieving” over trees losing their “[l]eaves” as summer months leading into the autumn season is eventually noted to have a much greater meaning. That meaning, as Hopkins notes in the final line of the poem, is that Margaret is “mourn[ing]” the passage of her own life, even though she is not mature enough to grasp the notion."

Where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme

Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath,
But opportunity is real, and life is free,

And who are you that draws your veil across the stars?

I am the Negro bearing slavery’s scars.

I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek—
And finding only the same old stupid plan
Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak.

Of grab the gold! Of grab the ways of satisfying need!
Of work the men! Of take the pay!

In search of what I meant to be my home—

Let it be,"Let America Be America Again' by Langston Hughes is focused on the American Dream, what it means, and how it is impossible to capture. The poem takes the reader through the perspective of those who have been put-upon by a system that is supposed to help them. They are the poor, the immigrants, the African Americans, and the Native Americans. They are any who have sought the American Dream and found it to be nonexistent, at least for them. Through the text, Hughes outlines what it would mean to really have the America that people say exists. It will require taking the country back from the “leeches” who feed on the poor and truly achieving freedom."

There is a parrot imitating spring
in the palace, its feathers parsley green. Out of the swamp the cane appears
to haunt us, and we cut it down. El General searches for a word; he is all the world there is. Like a parrot imitating spring,
we lie down screaming as rain punches through and we come up green. We cannot speak an R—
out of the swamp, the cane appears
and then the mountain we call in whispers Katalina.
The children gnaw their teeth to arrowheads. There is a parrot imitating spring.
El General has found his word: perejil.
Who says it, lives. He laughs, teeth shining out of the swamp. The cane appears
in our dreams, lashed by wind and streaming. And we lie down. For every drop of blood there is a parrot imitating spring.
Out of the swamp the cane appears.
2. The Palace
The word the general’s chosen is parsley. It is fall, when thoughts turn
to love and death; the general thinks
of his mother, how she died in the fall
and he planted her walking cane at the grave and it flowered, each spring stolidly forming four-star blossoms. The general
pulls on his boots, he stomps to
her room in the palace, the one without curtains, the one with a parrot
in a brass ring. As he paces he wonders Who can I kill today. And for a moment the little knot of screams
is still. The parrot, who has traveled
all the way from Australia in an ivory cage, is, coy as a widow, practising spring. Ever since the morning his mother collapsed in the kitchen while baking skull-shaped candies for the Day of the Dead, the general has hated sweets. He orders pastries brought up for the bird; they arrive
dusted with sugar on a bed of lace. The knot in his throat starts to twitch; he sees his boots the first day in battle splashed with mud and urine
as a soldier falls at his feet amazed—
how stupid he looked!— at the sound
of artillery. I never thought it would sing the soldier said, and died. Now
the general sees the fields of sugar cane, lashed by rain and streaming. He sees his mother’s smile, the teeth gnawed to arrowheads. He hears the Haitians sing without R’s
as they swing the great machetes: Katalina, they sing, Katalina,
mi madle, mi amol en muelte. God knows his mother was no stupid woman; she could roll an R like a queen. Even a parrot can roll an R! In the bare room the bright feathers arch in a parody of greenery, as the last pale crumbs
disappear under the blackened tongue. Someone
calls out his name in a voice
so like his mother’s, a startled tear
splashes the tip of his right boot.

The first part of the poem is told from the perspective of the laborers who, practically enslaved to Trujillo, work in the fields. They are haunted by his image and by the image of the sugarcane growing through the swamp. These workers are controlled, in every way possible, by this incredibly cruel man. In the second half of the poem, the speaker moves into the third person in order to give the reader some insight into Trujillo's mind. His sorrow over the death of his mother is the driving force that inspires him to slaughter all those who could roll their “r's” as she could."

With the alteration of their name, they have severed all ties to the past. The person Larkin knew, the young beautiful girl, is gone. All he has left are the memories. In the next lines, Larkin describes how the listener's maiden name is lost to her. Everything she used to own with her old name on it has been discarded. As if acting negligently, she has thrown it all away. The final stanza describes in detail how the speaker takes comfort in her old name. It still exists but now it only represents memories. There, within the past, he is able to commune with the girl he knew before."

Auden describes, through the use of one specific artwork, the impact of suffering on humankind. The poem begins with the speaker stating that the “Old Masters” who were responsible for the art he was looking at, knew struggle well. Through their paintings, they were able to portray suffering in a way that most people never see it. It goes on in the background while others sit, eat, and go about their normal lives. He continues on to say that suffering can take many forms and even revolve around the same event, such as the birth of a child. In the final lines of the first stanza, the speaker mentions martyrs and how their sacrifice is never properly appreciated. It fades into the background and is overtaken by the mundane world. In the second stanza, he refers directly to a piece of art, Landscape with the Fall of Icarus. In this work, one can observe Icarus falling into the sea in the bottom right-hand corner. In the foreground, there are figures ploughing the land and preparing to sail. No one notices the boy's suffering or if they do, they make no effort to help. Their lives take precedence over another's struggle. "

Since 1914, poets, artists and writers have been trying to document, explain, and to illustrate the war experience for the commoners at home, and for the soldiers who have lived through it; trying to make sure that, in the case of horrific wars such as the First World War, such a conflict is never repeated. Countless attempts have been made to throw light on the idea of loyalty, fealty, and the needlessly bloody sacrifices that soldiers make for queen and country. That being kept in mind, the fact that there are still wars raging today – or, in the case of England, were raging until quite recently – means that there is no shortage of material for poets to draw upon, and that is the subject of Simon Armitage's 'Remains'."

And gave a start to see,
As if rapt in my inditing,

The poem begins with the speaker sitting at his writing desk, looking up, and being startled by the presence of the moon directly outside his window. He initially believes the moon is there to see what he is writing, but after he asks her what she is doing. Her answer quickly contradicts this assumption. She states that she out looking for the body of a man who killed himself by drowning. The man was overwrought with sorrow over the death of his son, an innocent young man killed in battle. The moon is distraught by this battle and those who willingly participate in it. Continuing on, the moon addresses the speaker once more. She says that she is there at his window because she wants to know what kind of man can spend his time writing when the world is experiencing battles such as this. She believes he is willingly wearing blinders, ignorant of what is truly important. He is deeply upset by this accusation but plays directly into her opinion of him, hiding from her gaze."

Guileless and clear,
Oval soul-animals,
Taking up half the space,
Moving and rubbing on the silk

Giving a shriek and pop
When attacked, then scooting to rest, barely trembling.
Yellow cathead, blue fish————
Such queer moons we live with

Instead of dead furniture!
Straw mats, white walls

Delighting

Old ground with a feather
Beaten in starry metals.

His balloon squeak like a cat.

A funny pink world he might eat on the other side of it,

It is also one of the best confessional poems as it expresses the vulnerable side of depression. Sylvia sees beauty in ordinary things, but it only lasts for a short while, and she is back to the harsh reality that breaks her heart and removes her happiness. In the end, she explains how one's childhood dreams and innocence is lost as the person grows up and is left with the harsh reality. "

This is an unusual choice as a sonnet is a form most often associated with love poems. The poem is highly comical and full of amusing comparisons and colorful metaphors. It employs several tricolons, a poetic device whereby three adjectives are used in quick succession. Perhaps this repeating pattern of description is supposed to symbolize a heartbeat? One thing is for sure the poem “zips along” at a breakneck pace. The subject matter is a person giving up their organs to the national health service, although as I have asserted I think there are deeper levels to this poem. Whilst I have assigned this poem a title it doesn't actually have one. It is taken from a collection called Book of Matches. In this collection all the poems are supposed to be able to be read in the time it takes for a match to burn to its end."

The poem explores the physical things they see and how they occupy their time while on the train. It turns to an introspective dream state, discussing how strangers are linked through their dreams and can relate to each other as everyone has a problem going on. The final part of the poem turns to these 'problems', presenting the strangers looking inward, always trying to 'solve' something that is bothering them. When the passengers depart, Zapruder suggests that a part of the journey lives on within them forever, never really leaving behind the memory of traveling."

The speaker of the poem is describing a trip on which he is embarking. He describes himself as being “healthy and free,” and he realizes he is the only person who is in complete control of his life; he chooses his own destiny. Because of this realization, he does not have to wish or hope or pray for good fortune. He attests that he, himself, is his own good fortune, and that is all he needs. There is nothing that he is lacking. He will reach his destination on his own, and the earth will provide him with anything extra that is necessary. This is not to say that the road he is taking is not paved with imperfections and burdens. Rather than worry, however, the speaker has decided to take those burdens with him and deal with them as they arise."

The speaker starts the poem by including herself as part of the country. “We are the coffin fillers,” she says. The country is responsible for countless deaths that are treated callously. They occur regularly and in such a way that the government does not appear to care who they impact and why. The poem goes on, describing a child opening a shoebox bomb and a woman washing her mangled heart in the river. These striking and emotional images are contrasted with the lack of regard the speaker sees America showing for the rest of the world. The poem concludes with the speaker asking America where its “credentials” are or what right it has to take the actions its been taking."

And you know it's the only leverage
You've got.

And agree, a girl without money
Is nothing, dust
To be pushed around by any old breeze.

To be a fire escape.

She's had to make decisions that might seem like the wrong ones, but at the time, they were the only good ones she had. She chose the speaker's father after being with a man of “no account,” someone who made the speaker's cruel father seem like a dependable island.

Nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is
Filled by dead eyes too tender to know change?

To conquer grief, tries more ... as all things prove;

The poem begins with the speaker asking a few questions about her beloved and expressing her concerns about their future. She's leaving her life behind and hopes that Browning is ready to do the same for her. At the same time, she's amazed that she could've ever thought that she wouldn't miss the elements of her day-to-day life (the things that brought her comfort when she was most sorrowful), but she's willingly leaving them behind."

This poem begins with the imagery of a strong wind. It unsettles the crows sitting on the roof. They cannot hold on to their position for the pressure. Hence they fly away and try to perch on things that come across. In the following lines, Eady likens the crows' flight to an awkward dance. It appears to be a comic incident to the speaker. Besides, their dance also reminds him of the embarrassing situations occurring while one's love goes wrong."
723,723,723,"The skies they were ashen and sober;
The leaves they were crispéd and sere—
The leaves they were withering and sere;
It was night in the lonesome October
Of my most immemorial year;
It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,
In the misty mid region of Weir—
It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,
In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

Here once, through an alley Titanic,
Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul—
Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.
These were days when my heart was volcanic
As the scoriac rivers that roll—
As the lavas that restlessly roll
Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek
In the ultimate climes of the pole—
That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek
In the realms of the boreal pole.

Our talk had been serious and sober,
But our thoughts they were palsied and sere—
Our memories were treacherous and sere—
For we knew not the month was October,
And we marked not the night of the year—
(Ah, night of all nights in the year!)
We noted not the dim lake of Auber—
(Though once we had journeyed down here)—
We remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,
Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

And now, as the night was senescent
And star-dials pointed to morn—
As the star-dials hinted of morn—
At the end of our path a liquescent
And nebulous lustre was born,
Out of which a miraculous crescent
Arose with a duplicate horn—
Astarte's bediamonded crescent
Distinct with its duplicate horn.

And I said—""She is warmer than Dian:
She rolls through an ether of sighs—
She revels in a region of sighs:
She has seen that the tears are not dry on
These cheeks, where the worm never dies,
And has come past the stars of the Lion
To point us the path to the skies—
To the Lethean peace of the skies—
Come up, in despite of the Lion,
To shine on us with her bright eyes—
Come up through the lair of the Lion,
With love in her luminous eyes.""

But Psyche, uplifting her finger,
Said—""Sadly this star I mistrust—
Her pallor I strangely mistrust:—
Oh, hasten! oh, let us not linger!
Oh, fly!—let us fly!—for we must.""
In terror she spoke, letting sink her
Wings till they trailed in the dust—
In agony sobbed, letting sink her
Plumes till they trailed in the dust—
Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.

I replied—""This is nothing but dreaming:
Let us on by this tremulous light!
Let us bathe in this crystalline light!
Its Sybilic splendor is beaming
With Hope and in Beauty to-night:—
See!—it flickers up the sky through the night!
Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,
And be sure it will lead us aright—
We safely may trust to a gleaming
That cannot but guide us aright,
Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.""

Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,
And tempted her out of her gloom—
And conquered her scruples and gloom:
And we passed to the end of the vista,
But were stopped by the door of a tomb—
By the door of a legended tomb;
And I said—""What is written, sweet sister,
On the door of this legended tomb?""
She replied—""Ulalume—Ulalume—
'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!""

Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
As the leaves that were crispèd and sere—
As the leaves that were withering and sere,
And I cried—""It was surely October
On this very night of last year
That I journeyed—I journeyed down here—
That I brought a dread burden down here—
On this night of all nights in the year,
Oh, what demon has tempted me here?
Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber—
This misty mid region of Weir—
Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber—
In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.""

Said we, then—the two, then—""Ah, can it
Have been that the woodlandish ghouls—
The pitiful, the merciful ghouls—
To bar up our way and to ban it
From the secret that lies in these wolds—
From the thing that lies hidden in these wolds—
Had drawn up the spectre of a planet
From the limbo of lunary souls—
This sinfully scintillant planet
From the Hell of the planetary souls?""",The skies they were ashen and sober; The leaves they were crispéd and se,"‘Ulalume’ by Edgar Allan Poe is a poem that captures the eerie atmosphere of a lonesome October night. The speaker describes the desolate surroundings, with ashen skies, crisp and withering leaves, and misty lakes and woodlands. The speaker reminisces about wandering with their soul and psyche through a cypress alley during a time when his heart was volatile like the scoriac rivers and lava flows. Although engaged in serious conversation, their thoughts are withered and treacherous, and they fail to realize it is October, a significant night of the year. Suddenly, as the night approaches dawn, a mysterious light emerges, forming a crescent shape. The speaker believes it to be Astarte, a goddess warmer than the moon, guiding them to heavenly peace, shining with love in her eyes. However, Psyche expresses mistrust and urges them to flee, as terror overcomes her. Trying to reassure Psyche, the speaker interprets the light as a sign of hope and beauty, flickering through the night, urging them to follow it. They manage to pacify Psyche, and they continue their journey until they reach a tomb with the word ‘Ulalume’ written on it. The speaker’s heart grows somber as they recall bringing a dreadful burden to this place on the same night of the previous year, blaming a tempting demon. In fear, they contemplate whether woodland ghouls have barred their path to protect a secret hidden in the surrounding hills—a sinful planet brought from the depths of lunar souls. The poem ends with the lingering question of the origin and purpose of the mysterious tomb and the haunting presence of Ulalume, leaving a sense of darkness and unresolved mystery."

In the first stanza of this poem, the speaker declares that now, he's a man, and, like a tree, he can look back over his life and see the footsteps that led him to where he is now. This is not a process that he found to be rewarding. When analyzing his life, he discovers that he was misled by another person or group. Now, he's been left with a great deal of blood on his hands and the inability to escape from his guilt. There's nothing he can do to get away from the hurt he's feeling or change the life he's been living."
725,725,725,"Twelve o'clock.
Along the reaches of the street
Held in a lunar synthesis,
Whispering lunar incantations
Dissolve the floors of memory
And all its clear relations,
Its divisions and precisions,
Every street lamp that I pass
Beats like a fatalistic drum,
And through the spaces of the dark
Midnight shakes the memory
As a madman shakes a dead geranium.

Half-past one,
The street lamp sputtered,
The street lamp muttered,
The street lamp said, 'Regard that woman
Who hesitates towards you in the light of the door
Which opens on her like a grin.
You see the border of her dress
Is torn and stained with sand,
And you see the corner of her eye
Twists like a crooked pin.'

The memory throws up high and dry
A crowd of twisted things;
A twisted branch upon the beach
Eaten smooth, and polished
As if the world gave up
The secret of its skeleton,
Stiff and white.
A broken spring in a factory yard,
Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left
Hard and curled and ready to snap.

Half-past two,
The street lamp said,
'Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,
Slips out its tongue
And devours a morsel of rancid butter.'
So the hand of a child, automatic,
Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay.
I could see nothing behind that child's eye.
I have seen eyes in the street
Trying to peer through lighted shutters,
And a crab one afternoon in a pool,
An old crab with barnacles on his back,
Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.

Half-past three,
The lamp sputtered,
The lamp muttered in the dark.
The lamp hummed:
'Regard the moon,
La lune ne garde aucune rancune,
She winks a feeble eye,
She smiles into corners.
She smoothes the hair of the grass.
The moon has lost her memory.
A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,
Her hand twists a paper rose,
That smells of dust and old Cologne,
She is alone
With all the old nocturnal smells
That cross and cross across her brain.'
The reminiscence comes
Of sunless dry geraniums
And dust in crevices,
Smells of chestnuts in the streets,
And female smells in shuttered rooms,
And cigarettes in corridors
And cocktail smells in bars.

The lamp said,
'Four o'clock,
Here is the number on the door.
Memory!
You have the key,
The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,
Mount.
The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,
Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life.'

The last twist of the knife.",A solitary scream of a scream of a scream,"Rhapsody on a Windy Night' by T.S. Eliot depicts a desolate and depressing landscape of contemporary life that is enough to drive one mad. The poem begins with the speaker describing a wandering man walking through a dark street. It is midnight, and memories twist and blur. This corrupts one's experience of the world, making it harder to determine what is real and what is not. The wanderer hears the street lamps making noise, and eventually speaking. They tell the speaker to look in a doorway and observe a woman standing there. Her face is twisted, and the scene has a sinister feel. This encounter brings on some of the strange memories that are distorted by life. There is one of a smooth branch on the beach. It represents the bones of the world that have been scrubbed clean of anything living. The next lines speak to a loss of innocence, as seen in the eyes of a child. Then the poem moves on the moon. “She” is a calming presence, due to the fact that she lost her memories. The poem eventually concludes with the speaker returning to his apartment. Everything is there, ready for him to go to bed and get up in the morning and return to the dark and depressing world described in the previous five stanzas. "

It describes Actaeon as being a young hunter who accidentally saw Artemis, or Diana, the goddess of the hunt, naked while she was bathing. He was frozen to the spot, stunned by her beauty and Artemis caught him spying on her. As his punishment, he was told never to speak again or he would be transformed into a deer. The young man was unable to abide by this command and when he heard his pack of hunting dogs he called out to them. This transgression resulted in his transformation. The hounds of Actaeon, of which there were 30-50, were very swift and adept hunters. They did not know their master had been turned into a stag and they hunted him down and brutally tore him to pieces."

Under this cradle-hood and coverlid

But Gregory's wood and one bare hill
Whereby the haystack- and roof-levelling wind,
Bred on the Atlantic, can be stayed;
And for an hour I have walked and prayed
Because of the great gloom that is in my mind.

I have walked and prayed for this young child an hour
And heard the sea-wind scream upon the tower,
And under the arches of the bridge, and scream
In the elms above the flooded stream;
Imagining in excited reverie
That the future years had come,
Dancing to a frenzied drum,
Out of the murderous innocence of the sea.

Beauty to make a stranger's eye distraught,
Or hers before a looking-glass, for such,

And later had much trouble from a fool,
While that great Queen, that rose out of the spray,
Being fatherless could have her way
Yet chose a bandy-leggèd smith for man.

A crazy salad with their meat
Whereby the Horn of Plenty is undone.

In courtesy I'd have her chiefly learned;
Hearts are not had as a gift but hearts are earned
By those that are not entirely beautiful;
Yet many, that have played the fool
For beauty's very self, has charm made wise,
And many a poor man that has roved,
Loved and thought himself beloved,
From a glad kindness cannot take his eyes.

May she become a flourishing hidden tree
That all her thoughts may like the linnet be,
And have no business but dispensing round
Their magnanimities of sound,
Nor but in merriment begin a chase,
Nor but in merriment a quarrel.
O may she live like some green laurel
Rooted in one dear perpetual place.

My mind, because the minds that I have loved,
The sort of beauty that I have approved,
Prosper but little, has dried up of late,

May well be of all evil chances chief.
If there's no hatred in a mind
Assault and battery of the wind
Can never tear the linnet from the leaf.

An intellectual hatred is the worst,
So let her think opinions are accursed.
Have I not seen the loveliest woman born
Out of the mouth of Plenty's horn,
Because of her opinionated mind
Barter that horn and every good
By quiet natures understood
For an old bellows full of angry wind?

Considering that, all hatred driven hence,
The soul recovers radical innocence
And learns at last that it is self-delighting,
Self-appeasing, self-affrighting,
And that its own sweet will is Heaven's will;
She can, though every face should scowl
And every windy quarter howl
Or every bellows burst, be happy still.

And may her bridegroom bring her to a house
Where all's accustomed, ceremonious;
For arrogance and hatred are the wares
Peddled in the thoroughfares.
How but in custom and in ceremony
Are innocence and beauty born?

And custom for the spreading laurel tree.",A woman who is a liar and a snob is,"W. B. Yeats, in his ten-stanza poem, ‘A Prayer for my Daughter’, questions how best to raise his daughter. Though by 1919, the war was over, in Ireland, it yet turned normal. So, he ponders how she will survive the difficult times ahead in the politically turbulent times. The poem not only expresses the helplessness of Yeats as a father but all fathers who had to walk through this situation. He wants to give his daughter a life of beauty and innocence, safety, and security. He further wants her to be well-mannered and full of humility, free from intellectual hatred and being strongly opinionated. Finally, he wants her to get married into an aristocratic family which is rooted in spirituality and traditional values."

his young son, charging the hill
as wild as the long-maned ponies

one hand on the small of his back

pointing out all the places lived in
by the fathers and sons before them:
Tretower, Raglan, Bredwardine ...

And what he meant by this but never said, was

but the depth of their impression;

Several stanzas span their story, focusing on the theme of family and heritage. In stanza 7 a Volta occurs, drawing the poem into the present, watching the father tipping ashes into the fort, watching them slowly drift away from him. The poem focuses on family, grief, and nature’s ability to support. It is tragic and reflects the father’s loss of a son."

Cramped on nothing. Black
Admonitory cliffs, and the sea exploding
With no bottom, or anything on the other side of it,
Whitened by the faces of the drowned.
Now it is only gloomy, a dump of rocks —-
Leftover soldiers from old, messy wars.
The sea cannons into their ear, but they don't budge.
Other rocks hide their grudges under the water.

The cliffs are edged with trefoils, stars and bells
Such as fingers might embroider, close to death,
Almost too small for the mists to bother with.
The mists are part of the ancient paraphernalia —-
Souls, rolled in the doom-noise of the sea.
They bruise the rocks out of existence, then resurrect them.
They go up without hope, like sighs.
I walk among them, and they stuff my mouth with cotton.
When they free me, I am beaded with tears.

Our Lady of the Shipwrecked is striding toward the horizon,
Her marble skirts blown back in two pink wings.
A marble sailor kneels at her foot distractedly, and at his foot
A peasant woman in black
Is praying to the monument of the sailor praying.
Our Lady of the Shipwrecked is three times life size,
Her lips sweet with divinity.
She does not hear what the sailor or the peasant is saying —-
She is in love with the beautiful formlessness of the sea.

Beside the postcard stalls.
The peasants anchor them with conches. One is told:
""These are the pretty trinkets the sea hides,
Little shells made up into necklaces and toy ladies.

But from another place, tropical and blue,
We have never been to.
These are our crêpes.

'Finisterre' by Sylvia Plath is all about the Cape Finisterre and revolves around all the things that are associated with this place. In the first stanza, the poet gives a preliminary description of the edges of the cape and reflects on the sea that devoured several “faces” throughout history. The next stanza talks about the men who “rolled in the doom-noise of the sea”. The poet finds herself among them who “go up without hope, like sighs”. In the third stanza, the poet visualizes a figure of a “Lady of the Shipwrecked”, three times bigger than a normal person. The mysterious lady appears as a guardian spirit of that place. In the last stanza, there is a reference to a peasant woman and a sailor. It seems that they have come there as pilgrims. They offer the poet “crêpes”, a type of pancake at the end of the poem."

The poem begins with the speaker describing how the place he loves no longer gives him shade. The trees have been cut down and are now more like seats. Their loss has impacted more than just his own emotions though, the blackbird no longer has anywhere to gain protection from the sun and has been forced to move to a new “scene.” In conclusion, the speaker realizes that the pleasures of life are incredibly short, so much so that they are sure to die out before humankind does. The entire situation has forced the speaker to contend with his own death. Read more of William Cowper's poems."

'On Turning Ten' by Billy Collins is a very melancholy poem. The speaker, a child who is turning ten soon, discusses his feelings on going from being in the single digits to double. He feels as if he has a sickness of his soul when thinking about turning ten, and he realizes the pain and heartache that surely awaits him now that he is mature. An adult to whom the speaker is close, presumably his parent, tells the speaker that he is too young to be so retrospective, that he should enjoy his childhood still. However, the speaker confesses that this is impossible: he now sees the world differently than he once did in his younger years. "

You have been second always. Tragical?
No. You preferred it to the usual thing:
One dull man, dulling and uxorious,
One average mind — with one thought less, each year.

Throughout the lines of the poem, Pound uses figurative language to create a complex portrait of a woman. This woman is at the heart of all the good and mundane ideas the “great minds” and “bright ships” have asked her for. She is the source of inspiration that many a writer and artist has turned to throughout time when they were at a loss. Despite the fact that she is secondary to a larger, more abstract artistic goal, Pound's speaker doesn't think she minds. She is the Sargasso Sea to writers and artists, everything is attracted to her, and she gives back bits and pieces, some of which come to fruition and others that do not. The poem concludes with the speaker noting that despite all the things she seems to own, and all the things that are given to her, she truly owns nothing. The intangible nature of ideas and concepts means that she is made of other people's work."

It live for looks) a locust billows
In leaf-green and shade-violet,
A standing mercy.

Its random, clutched-for, homefelt blisses,
The circumstances of an accident?

Jailed in his breast; and, just as I,

From the tar of the blazing square

And unavowing, unavailable sorrow.
Yet the intonation of a name confesses
Some secrets that they never meant

The bowed and weathered heads above the denim
Or the once-too-often washed wash dresses?
They are subdued to their own element.
One day
The red, clay face
Is lowered to the naked clay;
After some words, the body is forsaken
The shadows lengthen, and a dreaming hope
Breathes, from the vague mound, Life;
From the grove under the spire
Stars shine, and a wandering light
Is kindled for the mourner, man.

Sees, in the moonlight, graves.","A bird that I don't know, Hunched on his light-pole like","A Country Life' by Randall Jarrell gives a deeply felt depiction of the impacts of life, death, and loneliness on one's life before death finally comes. The poem begins with the speaker noticing a bird he has never seen before. Form these lines he moves to describe the surroundings of the bird. They are in farmland, a place that represents life but just like everywhere else, is plagued with death. He considers asking someone what this bird is doing there but fears the answer. This is something that will be repeated later on as the speaker analyzes humanity's questioning of their own place in the world. The following sections speak on farmers “jailed” in their breasts and “secrets” that should not be “let out” of the soul. In conclusion, the speaker describes how all the questions cease when one dies. One's place beneath the ground, under a “mound” becomes a source for a new life."

The child is demanding and selfish in fulfilling his needs, yet innocent. The poet hopes that the child would become a better adult as he grows. 'Mundus et Infans' by Auden describes a child. The child is projected as an aggressive and demanding one from its birth. The child, like a ruler, a tyrant demands his mother to provide him with all he requires to satisfy his physical needs. Further, the poet draws a parallel between the child and a Saint. Both of them are innocent and unaware of manipulating. Auden's observations about human nature are woven into the characteristics of the child, through political, historical, psychological, and economic terms. The underlying irony in the poem compares the authorities in the political and religious fields to the child. Similar to the child, they demand the people supplement them with all they demand without shame. The poet and the others with him hope for the child to become a good one, unlike the tyrants."

In the first lines of 'To a Snail,' the speaker begins by loosely describing a snail, how it moves, and its ability to compress its own body. These lines are an extended metaphor, referring to the choices writers make. She discusses her dislike for unnecessary adornments to the written word or the thought that each word flows naturally from the next and should remain that way. The poem concludes with the speaker reminding everyone that they must be the judge of their own works. They have to, as she does, determine which words are the best at getting their message across without unnecessary additions."

The poem begins with the speaker describing a monumental effort that is rewarded by only death. These thoughts are followed by a downward spiral that starts with memories of boyhood. He remembers when there was no reason to worry about waking up in the morning or what life would bring. The fact that he can recall what that pure emotion felt like makes his current state of being all the harder to contend with. The next sections move through the ways in which the earth has been degraded. The speaker's main problem is with the godless way in which humankind is living. There is a no longer true passion in, or dedication to, worship. The poem concludes with the speaker stating that if things continue the way they are, which he thinks they will, the future generations will suffer. The earth will become a planet aimlessly floating through space with a population that doesn't take the time to consider the bigger questions of life."

He eventually encounters the ghosts of long-dead friends and comes to the conclusion that this place is good for him. He has many woes to contend with and seems to be able to address them here. The poem ends as it began, with an almost perfect repletion of the opening six lines."

The poet reflects over what he has lost, thinking of past relationships in the dark. There is a great sense of loss, Gibbons feeling his memories fade away. The relationship is described as fleeting, nothing more than a 'moment pulse' in his life. The world around the poet continues, a 'snowplow' clearing the roads for tomorrow's activities. It seems that Gibbons cannot come to terms with his break up, focusing again and again on his memories. The melancholic backdrop of 'night' reflects his somber mood, the poet mourning what he has lost."

Throughout the lines of 'the mother,' the speaker remembers her past experiences and the children that she's now never going to actually “get”. She wonders about the people that they could've grown up into and even speaks directly to them, a technique known as apostrophe. The poem ends with the speaker saying that she “loved” all the children she almost had."

We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.
It was bare and bright, and smelled like a stable—

We lay on a hill-top underneath the moon;
And the whistles kept blowing, and the dawn came soon.

We were very tired, we were very merry—
We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry;

And the sun rose dripping, a bucketful of gold.

We were very tired, we were very merry,
We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.
We hailed, “Good morrow, mother!” to a shawl-covered head,

'Recuerdo' means “I remember” as well as referring to “a memory” in Spanish. As with all memories, it is often uncertain how dependable they are. As one reads through this piece they are confronted with ever-expanding details, but there is no statement about how accurate those details really are."

Of old age too, and in his bed!
And could that mighty warrior fall?

And, trust me, as the noise grows stronger,
He’d wish to sleep a little longer.
And could he be indeed so old

Part of what one should take note of is in the title, this is a “satirical” poem. That means that the text makes use of humour, irony, and exaggeration to criticize someone or something. In this case, considering the rest of the title, it is definitely someone. This someone has died, and the text of the poem is meant to be an “elegy” or brief poetic statement about their life. The person to whom the title refers is John Churchill. He was the first Duke of Marlborough and died in 1722. It is clear from the text that Swift did not see this man as deserving of a genuine elegy. He used the poem to make fun of the man's accomplishments and make his disdain for Churchill known."

The poem begins with the first of many questions about the life and tribulations of the unnamed woman, who appears to have been in some kind of battle, either literal or metaphorical. As the stanzas continue, there are fleeting details revealed about the woman who appears to be some kind of savior but has been rejected by those she helped. Ultimately, the woman is not offered help and the poem concludes with the claim that she will have to stand alone, as one suspects she always did."

And tries to forget it has dreamed of the stars
While it breaks, breaks, breaks on the sheltering bars.","The heart of a woman goes forth with the dawn, As a lone bir","'The Heart of a Woman' by Georgia Douglas Johnson describes the freedom for which women yearn and the shelters in which they are imprisoned. The poems begins with the speaker describing how at dawn a woman's heart is able to fly forth from her home like a “lone bird.” This is the only way that a woman is able to experience, even for a time, true freedom. A woman's heart, described as a softly flying bird, travels over all the varying landscapes of the world below. She flies over valleys and turrets and travels through all the feelings that call her home. She will return soon enough. In the second stanza, the day has ended and the woman is forced back into the reality of her world. The bird is once more imprisoned in an “alien cage” that is meant to keep it safe. This confinement seems absurd and incomprehensible to the woman who was just living in so much freedom. In the final lines of this piece, the cage in which the woman is trapped is described as being a “shelter.” This “shelter,” meant to keep a woman from falling to any harm, is the structure that harms her the most."

I rose, blessed by the sun.
A horny fiend, I crept
out with my father's gun.
Let him dream of a child

who swooped home at this hour
with day-light riddled eyes
to his place on a high beam
in our old stables, to dream

light's useless time away.
I stood, holding my breath,
in urine-scented hay,
master of life and death,
a wisp-haired judge whose law
would punish beak and claw.

wing, as I watched, afraid
by the fallen gun, a lonely
child who believed death clean

and dribbled through the loose straw
tangling in bowels, and hopped
blindly closer. I saw

mirror my cruelty

not bear the light nor hide

This narrative poem begins with the speaker describing how one morning when the family was asleep, they stole their father's gun and snuck outside. They admit that they aren't the best-behaved child but are happy to have their family think they are. The speaker goes to the old stables with the intention of killing a barn owl. The speaker describes how the owl sleeps uselessly through the day and how they felt the power of life and death as they moved through the barn. The first shot hit the bird but didn't kill it. It bled all over the ground, and the speaker looked into the owl's eyes and saw their own mirrored back. The father appears in the final lines of the poems and tells the speaker that now they have to finish what they started, despite the fact that they seem to be regretting their choice by this point. The speaker fires the gun again, and the owl dies. The young speaker cried in their father's arms and mourned the loss of the owl. It took seeing death up close and knowing that the owl had a life and mind of its own to fully appreciate what it means to take life."

She also alludes to the broader state of the country and the ways that “we” all have to come together to honor the work of those who have lost their lives and those, like the three honorary captains, who continue to work to better the lives of others.

If read from top to bottom, this piece expresses a speaker's belief that they are too ugly to find love or happiness. They don't believe that any beauty inside of them is worth anything. If read from bottom to top, the exact opposite is true. The speaker knows they are beautiful, and no one can tell them anything different."

This book included prehistoric Latin devotional poems and hymns in addition to more modern verses. Right after this first publication, Rossetti combined the poem, The Good Friday in her 2nd volume of poetry, which is known as The Prince’s Progress and Other Poems in 1866. Good Friday is a devotional poem. From a literary point of view, the word ‘devotional’ means writing that could augment the religious life or faith of a person. Rossetti, through her pen, had composed a large number of poems based on devotional themes. In these poems, the poet composed prayer poems to express her intimate bond with God and to boost her readers so that they can live a devotional and God-worshipping life. All of Rossetti’s devotional poems orbit around the prophecies, warnings, and promises that you find in the Bible."

He can tell by the sight of the “Roman wormwood,” also known as, he says, “Ambrosia elatior.” It is the immortal food of the Greek gods. The plants have sprinkled their “yellow dust over” the speaker's shoes and he tracks it back into his house. In the next section, the speaker describes his shoes on the floor in front of him. They are covered in yellow dust as well as evidence of moving through the countryside. This train of thought leads him to a meditation on the lives of those who never venture into the country. He dislikes this way of living and believes the men and women are punished by missing out on the experiences he has."

This evening more than usual, and it seems
As if—forgive now—should you let me sit
Here by the window with your hand in mine
And look a half-hour forth on Fiesole,
Both of one mind, as married people use,
Quietly, quietly the evening through,
I might get up to-morrow to my work
Cheerful and fresh as ever. Let us try.
To-morrow, how you shall be glad for this!
Your soft hand is a woman of itself,
And mine the man's bared breast she curls inside.

And, I suppose, is looked on by in turn,
While she looks—no one's: very dear, no less.

There's what we painters call our harmony!

All in a twilight, you and I alike

My youth, my hope, my art, being all toned down
To yonder sober pleasant Fiesole.

That length of convent-wall across the way
Holds the trees safer, huddled more inside;
The last monk leaves the garden; days decrease,
And autumn grows, autumn in everything.

As if I saw alike my work and self
And all that I was born to be and do,
A twilight-piece. Love, we are in God's hand.

So free we seem, so fettered fast we are!
I feel he laid the fetter: let it lie!

Nor care to understand about my art,
But you can hear at least when people speak:

Behold Madonna!—I am bold to say.
I can do with my pencil what I know,
What I see, what at bottom of my heart
I wish for, if I ever wish so deep—
Do easily, too—when I say, perfectly,
I do not boast, perhaps: yourself are judge,
Who listened to the Legate's talk last week,
And just as much they used to say in France.
At any rate 'tis easy, all of it!
No sketches first, no studies, that's long past:

Well, less is more, Lucrezia: I am judged.
There burns a truer light of God in them,
In their vexed beating stuffed and stopped-up brain,

Enter and take their place there sure enough,
Though they come back and cannot tell the world.

Or their praise either. Somebody remarks

His hue mistaken; what of that? or else,
Rightly traced and well ordered; what of that?
Speak as they please, what does the mountain care?
Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp,
Or what's a heaven for? All is silver-grey,
Placid and perfect with my art: the worse!
I know both what I want and what might gain,
And yet how profitless to know, to sigh
""Had I been two, another and myself,
""Our head would have o'erlooked the world!"" No doubt.
Yonder's a work now, of that famous youth
The Urbinate who died five years ago.
('Tis copied, George Vasari sent it me.)
Well, I can fancy how he did it all,
Pouring his soul, with kings and popes to see,
Reaching, that heaven might so replenish him,
Above and through his art—for it gives way;
That arm is wrongly put—and there again—
A fault to pardon in the drawing's lines,
Its body, so to speak: its soul is right,
He means right—that, a child may understand.
Still, what an arm! and I could alter it:
But all the play, the insight and the stretch—
(Out of me, out of me! And wherefore out?
Had you enjoined them on me, given me soul,

Nay, Love, you did give all I asked, I think—
More than I merit, yes, by many times.
But had you—oh, with the same perfect brow,
And perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth,
And the low voice my soul hears, as a bird
The fowler's pipe, and follows to the snare —
Had you, with these the same, but brought a mind!
Some women do so. Had the mouth there urged
""God and the glory! never care for gain.
""The present by the future, what is that?
""Live for fame, side by side with Agnolo!
""Rafael is waiting: up to God, all three!""
I might have done it for you. So it seems:
Perhaps not. All is as God over-rules.
Beside, incentives come from the soul's self;
The rest avail not. Why do I need you?
What wife had Rafael, or has Agnolo?
In this world, who can do a thing, will not;
And who would do it, cannot, I perceive:
Yet the will's somewhat—somewhat, too, the power—
And thus we half-men struggle. At the end,
God, I conclude, compensates, punishes.
'Tis safer for me, if the award be strict,
That I am something underrated here,
Poor this long while, despised, to speak the truth.
I dared not, do you know, leave home all day,
For fear of chancing on the Paris lords.
The best is when they pass and look aside;
But they speak sometimes; I must bear it all.
Well may they speak! That Francis, that first time,
And that long festal year at Fontainebleau!
I surely then could sometimes leave the ground,
Put on the glory, Rafael's daily wear,
In that humane great monarch's golden look,—
One finger in his beard or twisted curl
Over his mouth's good mark that made the smile,
One arm about my shoulder, round my neck,
The jingle of his gold chain in my ear,
I painting proudly with his breath on me,
All his court round him, seeing with his eyes,
Such frank French eyes, and such a fire of souls
Profuse, my hand kept plying by those hearts,—
And, best of all, this, this, this face beyond,
This in the background, waiting on my work,
To crown the issue with a last reward!
A good time, was it not, my kingly days?
And had you not grown restless... but I know—
'Tis done and past: 'twas right, my instinct said:
Too live the life grew, golden and not grey,
And I'm the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt
Out of the grange whose four walls make his world.
How could it end in any other way?
You called me, and I came home to your heart.
The triumph was—to reach and stay there; since
I reached it ere the triumph, what is lost?
Let my hands frame your face in your hair's gold,
You beautiful Lucrezia that are mine!
""Rafael did this, Andrea painted that;
""The Roman's is the better when you pray,
""But still the other's Virgin was his wife—""
Men will excuse me. I am glad to judge
Both pictures in your presence; clearer grows
My better fortune, I resolve to think.
For, do you know, Lucrezia, as God lives,
Said one day Agnolo, his very self,
To Rafael . . . I have known it all these years . . .
(When the young man was flaming out his thoughts
Upon a palace-wall for Rome to see,
Too lifted up in heart because of it)
""Friend, there's a certain sorry little scrub
""Goes up and down our Florence, none cares how,
""Who, were he set to plan and execute
""As you are, pricked on by your popes and kings,
""Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours!""
To Rafael's!—And indeed the arm is wrong.
I hardly dare . . . yet, only you to see,
Give the chalk here—quick, thus, the line should go!
Ay, but the soul! he's Rafael! rub it out!
Still, all I care for, if he spoke the truth,
(What he? why, who but Michel Agnolo?
Do you forget already words like those?)
If really there was such a chance, so lost,—
Is, whether you're—not grateful—but more pleased.
Well, let me think so. And you smile indeed!
This hour has been an hour! Another smile?
If you would sit thus by me every night
I should work better, do you comprehend?
I mean that I should earn more, give you more.
See, it is settled dusk now; there's a star;
Morello's gone, the watch-lights show the wall,
The cue-owls speak the name we call them by.
Come from the window, love,—come in, at last,
Inside the melancholy little house
We built to be so gay with. God is just.
King Francis may forgive me: oft at nights
When I look up from painting, eyes tired out,
The walls become illumined, brick from brick
Distinct, instead of mortar, fierce bright gold,
That gold of his I did cement them with!
Let us but love each other. Must you go?
That Cousin here again? he waits outside?
Must see you—you, and not with me? Those loans?
More gaming debts to pay? you smiled for that?
Well, let smiles buy me! have you more to spend?
While hand and eye and something of a heart
Are left me, work's my ware, and what's it worth?
I'll pay my fancy. Only let me sit
The grey remainder of the evening out,
Idle, you call it, and muse perfectly
How I could paint, were I but back in France,
One picture, just one more—the Virgin's face,
Not yours this time! I want you at my side
To hear them—that is, Michel Agnolo—
Judge all I do and tell you of its worth.
Will you? To-morrow, satisfy your friend.
I take the subjects for his corridor,
Finish the portrait out of hand—there, there,
And throw him in another thing or two
If he demurs; the whole should prove enough
To pay for this same Cousin's freak. Beside,
What's better and what's all I care about,
Get you the thirteen scudi for the ruff!
Love, does that please you? Ah, but what does he,
The Cousin! what does he to please you more?
I am grown peaceful as old age to-night.
I regret little, I would change still less.
Since there my past life lies, why alter it?
The very wrong to Francis!—it is true
I took his coin, was tempted and complied,
And built this house and sinned, and all is said.
My father and my mother died of want.
Well, had I riches of my own? you see
How one gets rich! Let each one bear his lot.
They were born poor, lived poor, and poor they died:
And I have laboured somewhat in my time
And not been paid profusely. Some good son
Paint my two hundred pictures—let him try!
No doubt, there's something strikes a balance. Yes,
You loved me quite enough. it seems to-night.
This must suffice me here. What would one have?
In heaven, perhaps, new chances, one more chance—
Four great walls in the New Jerusalem,
Meted on each side by the angel's reed,
For Leonard, Rafael, Agnolo and me
To cover—the three first without a wife,
While I have mine! So—still they overcome
Because there's still Lucrezia,—as I choose.
Again the Cousin's whistle! Go, my Love.","Lucrezia, a beautiful woman, is a twilight-piece","The poem begins with the speaker, the artist Andrea del Sarto, asking his wife, Lucrezia, to come and sit with him for a moment without fighting. He wants the two of them to have a quiet moment together before he jumps into a reflection of his life. The speaker begins by describing the passage of time and the lack of control he feels he had over his life. The speaker then spends the majority of the poem discussing how his skill level compares to the work of other artists. He knows that he has more skill than others such as Michelangelo or Raphael, but his art does not have the soul the others can tap into. Somehow they have been able to enter heaven and leave with inspiration that he never receives. The artist is disappointed by this fact as no one seems to value his own art the way he thinks they should. At points, he tries to put most of the blame for his life onto his wife. He thinks that she is the one that has been holding him back. He points out the fact that the other artists don't have the same impediment. He thinks about the time that he spent in France working for the king. There, he was applauded by the court but then forced back to Italy by his wife who was tired of the way things were. By the end of the poem, he concludes that although his life has not been what he wanted he knows that he cannot change it. He is happy to have spent this time with his wife and says as much to her. This nice moment is interrupted by the arrival of Lucrezia's cousin. This “cousin” is demanding money from del Sarto to help pay off gambling debts. He gives in to the request and tells his wife, solemnly and sadly, that she can go."

He did not wear his scarlet coat,
For blood and wine are red,
And blood and wine were on his hands
When they found him with the dead,
The poor dead woman whom he loved,
And murdered in her bed.

He walked amongst the Trial Men
In a suit of shabby gray;
A cricket cap was on his head,
And his step seemed light and gay;
But I never saw a man who looked
So wistfully at the day.

I never saw a man who looked
With such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
Which prisoners call the sky,
And at every drifting cloud that went
With sails of silver by.

I walked, with other souls in pain,
Within another ring,
And was wondering if the man had done
A great or little thing,
When a voice behind me whispered low,
""That fellow's got to swing.""

Dear Christ! the very prison walls
Suddenly seemed to reel,
And the sky above my head became
Like a casque of scorching steel;
And, though I was a soul in pain,
My pain I could not feel.

I only knew what hunted thought
Quickened his step, and why
He looked upon the garish day
With such a wistful eye;
The man had killed the thing he loved,
And so he had to die.

Yet each man kills the thing he loves,
By each let this be heard,
Some do it with a bitter look,
Some with a flattering word,
The coward does it with a kiss,
The brave man with a sword!

Some kill their love when they are young,
And some when they are old;
Some strangle with the hands of Lust,
Some with the hands of Gold:
The kindest use a knife, because
The dead so soon grow cold.

Some love too little, some too long,
Some sell, and others buy;
Some do the deed with many tears,
And some without a sigh:
For each man kills the thing he loves,
Yet each man does not die.

He does not die a death of shame
On a day of dark disgrace,
Nor have a noose about his neck,
Nor a cloth upon his face,
Nor drop feet foremost through the floor
Into an empty space.

He does not sit with silent men
Who watch him night and day;
Who watch him when he tries to weep,
And when he tries to pray;
Who watch him lest himself should rob
The prison of its prey.

He does not wake at dawn to see
Dread figures throng his room,
The shivering Chaplain robed in white,
The Sheriff stern with gloom,
And the Governor all in shiny black,
With the yellow face of Doom.

He does not rise in piteous haste
To put on convict-clothes,
While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes
Each new and nerve-twitched pose,
Fingering a watch whose little ticks
Are like horrible hammer-blows.

He does not know that sickening thirst
That sands one's throat, before
The hangman with his gardener's gloves
Slips through the padded door,
And binds one with three leathern thongs,
That the throat may thirst no more.

He does not bend his head to hear
The Burial Office read,
Nor while the terror of his soul
Tells him he is not dead,
Cross his own coffin, as he moves
Into the hideous shed.

He does not stare upon the air
Through a little roof of glass:
He does not pray with lips of clay
For his agony to pass;
Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek
The kiss of Caiaphas.

II
Six weeks the guardsman walked the yard,
In the suit of shabby gray:
His cricket cap was on his head,
And his step seemed light and gay,
But I never saw a man who looked
So wistfully at the day.

I never saw a man who looked
With such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
Which prisoners call the sky,
And at every wandering cloud that trailed
Its ravelled fleeces by.

He did not wring his hands, as do
Those witless men who dare
To try to rear the changeling Hope
In the cave of black Despair:
He only looked upon the sun,
And drank the morning air.

He did not wring his hands nor weep,
Nor did he peek or pine,
But he drank the air as though it held
Some healthful anodyne;
With open mouth he drank the sun
As though it had been wine!

And I and all the souls in pain,
Who tramped the other ring,
Forgot if we ourselves had done
A great or little thing,
And watched with gaze of dull amaze
The man who had to swing.

For strange it was to see him pass
With a step so light and gay,
And strange it was to see him look
So wistfully at the day,
And strange it was to think that he
Had such a debt to pay.

For oak and elm have pleasant leaves
That in the spring-time shoot:
But grim to see is the gallows-tree,
With its alder-bitten root,
And, green or dry, a man must die
Before it bears its fruit!

The loftiest place is that seat of grace
For which all worldlings try:
But who would stand in hempen band
Upon a scaffold high,
And through a murderer's collar take
His last look at the sky?

It is sweet to dance to violins
When Love and Life are fair:
To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes
Is delicate and rare:
But it is not sweet with nimble feet
To dance upon the air!

So with curious eyes and sick surmise
We watched him day by day,
And wondered if each one of us
Would end the self-same way,
For none can tell to what red Hell
His sightless soul may stray.

At last the dead man walked no more
Amongst the Trial Men,
And I knew that he was standing up
In the black dock's dreadful pen,
And that never would I see his face
In God's sweet world again.

Like two doomed ships that pass in storm
We had crossed each other's way:
But we made no sign, we said no word,
We had no word to say;
For we did not meet in the holy night,
But in the shameful day.

A prison wall was round us both,
Two outcast men we were:
The world had thrust us from its heart,
And God from out His care:
And the iron gin that waits for Sin
Had caught us in its snare.

III
In Debtors' Yard the stones are hard,
And the dripping wall is high,
So it was there he took the air
Beneath the leaden sky,
And by each side a Warder walked,
For fear the man might die.

Or else he sat with those who watched
His anguish night and day;
Who watched him when he rose to weep,
And when he crouched to pray;
Who watched him lest himself should rob
Their scaffold of its prey.

The Governor was strong upon
The Regulations Act:
The Doctor said that Death was but
A scientific fact:
And twice a day the Chaplain called,
And left a little tract.

And twice a day he smoked his pipe,
And drank his quart of beer:
His soul was resolute, and held
No hiding-place for fear;
He often said that he was glad
The hangman's hands were near.

But why he said so strange a thing
No Warder dared to ask:
For he to whom a watcher's doom
Is given as his task,
Must set a lock upon his lips,
And make his face a mask.

Or else he might be moved, and try
To comfort or console:
And what should Human Pity do
Pent up in Murderer's Hole?
What word of grace in such a place
Could help a brother's soul?

With slouch and swing around the ring
We trod the Fools' Parade!
We did not care: we knew we were
The Devil's Own Brigade:
And shaven head and feet of lead
Make a merry masquerade.

We tore the tarry rope to shreds
With blunt and bleeding nails;
We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,
And cleaned the shining rails:
And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,
And clattered with the pails.

We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,
We turned the dusty drill:
We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,
And sweated on the mill:
But in the heart of every man
Terror was lying still.

So still it lay that every day
Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:
And we forgot the bitter lot
That waits for fool and knave,
Till once, as we tramped in from work,
We passed an open grave.

With yawning mouth the yellow hole
Gaped for a living thing;
The very mud cried out for blood
To the thirsty asphalte ring:
And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair
Some prisoner had to swing.

Right in we went, with soul intent
On Death and Dread and Doom:
The hangman, with his little bag,
Went shuffling through the gloom:
And each man trembled as he crept
Into his numbered tomb.

That night the empty corridors
Were full of forms of Fear,
And up and down the iron town
Stole feet we could not hear,
And through the bars that hide the stars
White faces seemed to peer.

He lay as one who lies and dreams
In a pleasant meadow-land,
The watchers watched him as he slept,
And could not understand
How one could sleep so sweet a sleep
With a hangman close at hand.

But there is no sleep when men must weep
Who never yet have wept:
So we—the fool, the fraud, the knave—
That endless vigil kept,
And through each brain on hands of pain
Another's terror crept.

Alas! it is a fearful thing
To feel another's guilt!
For, right within, the sword of Sin
Pierced to its poisoned hilt,
And as molten lead were the tears we shed
For the blood we had not spilt.

The Warders with their shoes of felt
Crept by each padlocked door,
And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,
Gray figures on the floor,
And wondered why men knelt to pray
Who never prayed before.

All through the night we knelt and prayed,
Mad mourners of a corse!
The troubled plumes of midnight were
The plumes upon a hearse:
And bitter wine upon a sponge
Was the savour of Remorse.

The gray cock crew, the red cock crew,
But never came the day:
And crooked shapes of Terror crouched,
In the corners where we lay:
And each evil sprite that walks by night
Before us seemed to play.

They glided past, they glided fast,
Like travellers through a mist:
They mocked the moon in a rigadoon
Of delicate turn and twist,
And with formal pace and loathsome grace
The phantoms kept their tryst.

With mop and mow, we saw them go,
Slim shadows hand in hand:
About, about, in ghostly rout
They trod a saraband:
And damned grotesques made arabesques,
Like the wind upon the sand!

With the pirouettes of marionettes,
They tripped on pointed tread:
But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,
As their grisly masque they led,
And loud they sang, and long they sang,
For they sang to wake the dead.

""Oho!"" they cried, ""the world is wide,
But fettered limbs go lame!
And once, or twice, to throw the dice
Is a gentlemanly game,
But he does not win who plays with Sin
In the Secret House of Shame.""

No things of air these antics were,
That frolicked with such glee:
To men whose lives were held in gyves,
And whose feet might not go free,
Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,
Most terrible to see.

Around, around, they waltzed and wound;
Some wheeled in smirking pairs;
With the mincing step of a demirep
Some sidled up the stairs:
And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,
Each helped us at our prayers.

The morning wind began to moan,
But still the night went on:
Through its giant loom the web of gloom
Crept till each thread was spun:
And, as we prayed, we grew afraid
Of the Justice of the Sun.

The moaning wind went wandering round
The weeping prison-wall:
Till like a wheel of turning steel
We felt the minutes crawl:
O moaning wind! what had we done
To have such a seneschal?

At last I saw the shadowed bars,
Like a lattice wrought in lead,
Move right across the whitewashed wall
That faced my three-plank bed,
And I knew that somewhere in the world
God's dreadful dawn was red.

At six o'clock we cleaned our cells,
At seven all was still,
But the sough and swing of a mighty wing
The prison seemed to fill,
For the Lord of Death with icy breath
Had entered in to kill.

He did not pass in purple pomp,
Nor ride a moon-white steed.
Three yards of cord and a sliding board
Are all the gallows' need:
So with rope of shame the Herald came
To do the secret deed.

We were as men who through a fen
Of filthy darkness grope:
We did not dare to breathe a prayer,
Or to give our anguish scope:
Something was dead in each of us,
And what was dead was Hope.

For Man's grim Justice goes its way
And will not swerve aside:
It slays the weak, it slays the strong,
It has a deadly stride:
With iron heel it slays the strong,
The monstrous parricide!

We waited for the stroke of eight:
Each tongue was thick with thirst:
For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate
That makes a man accursed,
And Fate will use a running noose
For the best man and the worst.

We had no other thing to do,
Save to wait for the sign to come:
So, like things of stone in a valley lone,
Quiet we sat and dumb:
But each man's heart beat thick and quick,
Like a madman on a drum!

With sudden shock the prison-clock
Smote on the shivering air,
And from all the gaol rose up a wail
Of impotent despair,
Like the sound the frightened marshes hear
From some leper in his lair.

And as one sees most fearful things
In the crystal of a dream,
We saw the greasy hempen rope
Hooked to the blackened beam,
And heard the prayer the hangman's snare
Strangled into a scream.

And all the woe that moved him so
That he gave that bitter cry,
And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,
None knew so well as I:
For he who lives more lives than one
More deaths than one must die.

IV
There is no chapel on the day
On which they hang a man:
The Chaplain's heart is far too sick,
Or his face is far too wan,
Or there is that written in his eyes
Which none should look upon.

So they kept us close till nigh on noon,
And then they rang the bell,
And the Warders with their jingling keys
Opened each listening cell,
And down the iron stair we tramped,
Each from his separate Hell.

Out into God's sweet air we went,
But not in wonted way,
For this man's face was white with fear,
And that man's face was gray,
And I never saw sad men who looked
So wistfully at the day.

I never saw sad men who looked
With such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
We prisoners called the sky,
And at every careless cloud that passed
In happy freedom by.

But there were those amongst us all
Who walked with downcast head,
And knew that, had each got his due,
They should have died instead:
He had but killed a thing that lived,
Whilst they had killed the dead.

For he who sins a second time
Wakes a dead soul to pain,
And draws it from its spotted shroud,
And makes it bleed again,
And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,
And makes it bleed in vain!

Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb
With crooked arrows starred,
Silently we went round and round
The slippery asphalte yard;
Silently we went round and round,
And no man spoke a word.

Silently we went round and round,
And through each hollow mind
The Memory of dreadful things
Rushed like a dreadful wind,
And Horror stalked before each man,
And Terror crept behind.

The Warders strutted up and down,
And kept their herd of brutes,
Their uniforms were spick and span,
And they wore their Sunday suits,
But we knew the work they had been at,
By the quicklime on their boots.

For where a grave had opened wide,
There was no grave at all:
Only a stretch of mud and sand
By the hideous prison-wall,
And a little heap of burning lime,
That the man should have his pall.

For he has a pall, this wretched man,
Such as few men can claim:
Deep down below a prison-yard,
Naked for greater shame,
He lies, with fetters on each foot,
Wrapt in a sheet of flame!

And all the while the burning lime
Eats flesh and bone away,
It eats the brittle bone by night,
And the soft flesh by day,
It eats the flesh and bone by turns,
But it eats the heart alway.

For three long years they will not sow
Or root or seedling there:
For three long years the unblessed spot
Will sterile be and bare,
And look upon the wondering sky
With unreproachful stare.

They think a murderer's heart would taint
Each simple seed they sow.
It is not true! God's kindly earth
Is kindlier than men know,
And the red rose would but glow more red,
The white rose whiter blow.

Out of his mouth a red, red rose!
Out of his heart a white!
For who can say by what strange way,
Christ brings His will to light,
Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore
Bloomed in the great Pope's sight?

But neither milk-white rose nor red
May bloom in prison air;
The shard, the pebble, and the flint,
Are what they give us there:
For flowers have been known to heal
A common man's despair.

So never will wine-red rose or white,
Petal by petal, fall
On that stretch of mud and sand that lies
By the hideous prison-wall,
To tell the men who tramp the yard
That God's Son died for all.

Yet though the hideous prison-wall
Still hems him round and round,
And a spirit may not walk by night
That is with fetters bound,
And a spirit may but weep that lies
In such unholy ground,

He is at peace—this wretched man—
At peace, or will be soon:
There is no thing to make him mad,
Nor does Terror walk at noon,
For the lampless Earth in which he lies
Has neither Sun nor Moon.

They hanged him as a beast is hanged:
They did not even toll
A requiem that might have brought
Rest to his startled soul,
But hurriedly they took him out,
And hid him in a hole.

They stripped him of his canvas clothes,
And gave him to the flies:
They mocked the swollen purple throat,
And the stark and staring eyes:
And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud
In which their convict lies.

The Chaplain would not kneel to pray
By his dishonoured grave:
Nor mark it with that blessed Cross
That Christ for sinners gave,
Because the man was one of those
Whom Christ came down to save.

Yet all is well; he has but passed
To Life's appointed bourne:
And alien tears will fill for him
Pity's long-broken urn,
For his mourners will be outcast men,
And outcasts always mourn.

V
I know not whether Laws be right,
Or whether Laws be wrong;
All that we know who lie in gaol
Is that the wall is strong;
And that each day is like a year,
A year whose days are long.

But this I know, that every Law
That men have made for Man,
Since first Man took his brother's life,
And the sad world began,
But straws the wheat and saves the chaff
With a most evil fan.

This too I know—and wise it were
If each could know the same—
That every prison that men build
Is built with bricks of shame,
And bound with bars lest Christ should see
How men their brothers maim.

With bars they blur the gracious moon,
And blind the goodly sun:
And they do well to hide their Hell,
For in it things are done
That Son of God nor son of Man
Ever should look upon!

The vilest deeds like poison weeds
Bloom well in prison-air:
It is only what is good in Man
That wastes and withers there:
Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,
And the Warder is Despair.

For they starve the little frightened child
Till it weeps both night and day:
And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,
And gibe the old and gray,
And some grow mad, and all grow bad,
And none a word may say.

Each narrow cell in which we dwell
Is a foul and dark latrine,
And the fetid breath of living Death
Chokes up each grated screen,
And all, but Lust, is turned to dust
In Humanity's machine.

The brackish water that we drink
Creeps with a loathsome slime,
And the bitter bread they weigh in scales
Is full of chalk and lime,
And Sleep will not lie down, but walks
Wild-eyed, and cries to Time.

But though lean Hunger and green Thirst
Like asp with adder fight,
We have little care of prison fare,
For what chills and kills outright
Is that every stone one lifts by day
Becomes one's heart by night.

With midnight always in one's heart,
And twilight in one's cell,
We turn the crank, or tear the rope,
Each in his separate Hell,
And the silence is more awful far
Than the sound of a brazen bell.

And never a human voice comes near
To speak a gentle word:
And the eye that watches through the door
Is pitiless and hard:
And by all forgot, we rot and rot,
With soul and body marred.

And thus we rust Life's iron chain
Degraded and alone:
And some men curse, and some men weep,
And some men make no moan:
But God's eternal Laws are kind
And break the heart of stone.

And every human heart that breaks,
In prison-cell or yard,
Is as that broken box that gave
Its treasure to the Lord,
And filled the unclean leper's house
With the scent of costliest nard.

Ah! happy they whose hearts can break
And peace of pardon win!
How else may man make straight his plan
And cleanse his soul from Sin?
How else but through a broken heart
May Lord Christ enter in?

And he of the swollen purple throat,
And the stark and staring eyes,
Waits for the holy hands that took
The Thief to Paradise;
And a broken and a contrite heart
The Lord will not despise.

The man in red who reads the Law
Gave him three weeks of life,
Three little weeks in which to heal
His soul of his soul's strife,
And cleanse from every blot of blood
The hand that held the knife.

And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,
The hand that held the steel:
For only blood can wipe out blood,
And only tears can heal:
And the crimson stain that was of Cain
Became Christ's snow-white seal.

VI
In Reading gaol by Reading town
There is a pit of shame,
And in it lies a wretched man
Eaten by teeth of flame,
In a burning winding-sheet he lies,
And his grave has got no name.

And there, till Christ call forth the dead,
In silence let him lie:
No need to waste the foolish tear,
Or heave the windy sigh:
The man had killed the thing he loved,
And so he had to die.

And all men kill the thing they love,
By all let this be heard,
Some do it with a bitter look,
Some with a flattering word,
The coward does it with a kiss,
The brave man with a sword.","The man who killed the thing he loved, And so he had to die. An","“The Ballad of Reading Gaol” by Oscar Wilde tells of Wilde's experiences in prison and his observations of another prisoner condemned to die. The poem begins with the story of Charles Thomas Wooldridge who murdered his wife. The man has been sentenced to hang and goes about his life in prison wistfully. Wilde, and the other men, are jealous of his attitude as he has accepted his fate and is the better for it. In the second section Wooldridge is hanged. He meets his death bravely while the other men cower from even the idea. Wilde spends time describing how the monotony of jail is only broken by the terror of it. In the third section Wilde describes the daily activities of the prisoners and the way they spend their nights. They are haunted by phantoms that seem to be very much alive. The rest of the poem describes the funeral of Wooldridge and how his body was covered in lime. It also speaks on Wilde's general ideas about the justice system and that one must come to God to find happiness. The poem concludes with Wilde restating his original refrain regarding the fact that all men “kill the thing they love,” in one way or another."
755,755,755,"Aftear night’s thunder far away had rolled
The fiery day had a kernel sweet of cold,
And in the perfect blue the clouds uncurled,
Like the first gods before they made the world
And misery, swimming the stormless sea
In beauty and in divine gaiety.
The smooth white empty road was lightly strewn
With leaves—the holly’s Autumn falls in June—
And fir cones standing stiff up in the heat.
The mill-foot water tumbled white and lit
With tossing crystals, happier than any crowd
Of children pouring out of school aloud.
And in the little thickets where a sleeper
For ever might lie lost, the nettle-creeper
And garden warbler sang unceasingly;
While over them shrill shrieked in his fierce glee
The swift with wings and tail as sharp and narrow
As if the bow had flown off with the arrow.
Only the scent of woodbine and hay new-mown
Travelled the road. In the field sloping down,
Park-like, to where its willows showed the brook,
Haymakers rested. The tosser lay forsook
Out in the sun; and the long waggon stood
Without its team, it seemed it never would
Move from the shadow of that single yew.
The team, as still, until their task was due,
Beside the labourers enjoyed the shade
That three squat oaks mid-field together made
Upon a circle of grass and weed uncut,
And on the hollow, once a chalk-pit, but
Now brimmed with nut and elder-flower so clean.
The men leaned on their rakes, about to begin,
But still. And all were silent. All was old,
This morning time, with a great age untold,
Older than Clare and Cobbett, Morland and Crome,
Than, at the field’s far edge, the farmer’s home,
A white house crouched at the foot of a great tree.
Under the heavens that know not what years be
The men, the beasts, the trees, the implements
Uttered even what they will in times far hence—
All of us gone out of the reach of change—
Immortal in a picture of an old grange.","The grange sat on the edge of the field, a grove of","'Haymaking' by Edward Thomas describes a landscape and its laborers who are impacted in different ways by the passage of time. The poem begins with the speaker describing the end of a storm and the warmth that comes afterward. The scene is quite tranquil, highlighted by the fallen leaves on the road. Everything appears as it would've when the gods first created it. The speaker continues to discuss the water mill and the birds singing in the woods. These elements are different parts of the same landscape and interact with one another in interesting ways. The poem concludes with a description of the haymakers and the rest they took by the water and how that moment is at once temporary and immortal."

Coleridge is a poem that defines different kinds of metrical feet in layman's terms. In the first stanza of the poem, Coleridge talks about several metrical feet such as trochee, spondee, dactyl, iamb, anapest, amphibrach, and amphimacer. The poet uses layman's terms to discuss those meters. As an example, the definition of trochee, according to the poet, is, “Trochee trips from long to short.” Thereafter, in the second stanza, the poet advises his son, Derwent to be “innocent, steady, and wise.” Additionally, if he is close to nature he can be a great poet in the future. At last, Coleridge says, no matter what he will always remain his true admirer and love him."

His poem, ‘Flag’, is an indication of the great many different ways different people can view the same national symbolism. Most people are fairly familiar with their own national flag — for some it is an indication of pride, for some a sign of home, for others, a nostalgic memory. For others, the flag of a foreign country might represent whatever they think of when they consider that country. A number of these interpretations are explored in this poem, and the flag is given a great many dimensions to explore and represent.

Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of symbolism is that particular images and symbols don’t have set meanings, but are interpreted by the viewer in ways that are dependant on that viewer. Take a musical note, for instance — there’s absolutely nothing about those little drawn sticks that has anything to do with musical notes in a literal sense, but to most who view them, that is what they indicate. Those especially familiar with them can pinpoint exactly which note they refer to as well. For others, musical notes are a representation of a foreign language, one that they’ve never been able to establish familiarity with."

An,"'I Do Not Love Thee' by Caroline Elizabeth Sarah Norton is made up of a speaker's professed lack of love for the listener and the evidence very much to the contrary. The poem begins with the speaker stating that she does not love “you,” the listener. This statement which is utilized in all the stanzas, is followed by a number of features of her life which bother her. Firstly, she is sad when this person is not around. This is an emotion she is uncomfortable with. She is so sad that she becomes jealous of the stars who are able to look down on him. Additionally, the speaker is entranced by the listener's deep blue eyes, the way he can do no wrong, and the sound of his voice. All these factors lead a reader to mistrust the speaker. She is confessing her love by attempting to prove she is not in love."

Walking with an invisible border

Separating my left and right foot

I feel like an illegitimate child

Forsaken by my parents

At least I can claim innocence

Since I did not ask to come

Into this world

 

Walking on both sides of this

Invisible border

Each and every day

And for the rest of my life

Is like having been

Sentenced to a torture chamber

Without having committed a crime

 

Understanding the history of humanity

I am not the least surprised

This is happening to me

A non-entity

During this population explosion

In a minuscule world

 

I did not ask to be born an Inuk

Nor did I ask to be forced

To learn an alien culture

With an alien language

But I lucked out on fate

Which I am unable to do

 

I have resorted to fancy dancing

In order to survive each day

No wonder I have earned

The dubious reputation of being

The world’s premier choreographer

Of distinctive dance steps

That allow me to avoid

Potential personal paranoia

On both sides of this invisible border

 

Sometimes this border becomes so wide

That I am unable to take another step

My feet being too far apart

When my crotch begins to tear apart

I am forced to invent

A brand new dance step

The premier choreographer

Saving the day once more

 

Destiny acted itself out

Deciding for me where I would come from

And what I would become

 

So I am left to fend for myself

Walking in two different worlds

Trying my best to make sense

Of two opposing cultures

Which are unable to integrate

Lest they swallow one another whole

 

Each and every day

Is a fighting day

A war of raw nerves

And to show for my efforts

I have a fair share of wins and losses

When will all this end

This senseless battle

Between my left and right foot

 

When will the invisible border

Cease to be",It is never easy walking with an invisible border I feel like an illegitimate chil,"Walking Both Sides of an Invisible Border' by Alootook Ipellie depicts the inner thoughts of a speaker who is torn between two different worlds. In the first lines of this piece the speaker, who is very likely the poet himself, states that his life is never easy. He has to walk an invisible border, one foot on each side, every day. These two sides represent the way he was born, Inuk, and how he was forcibly raised in a Western education system. He knows that the way he is forced to live isn't his fault, but that doesn't make it easier. He feels as though destiny decided his life for him, and then left him to struggle through it and fend for himself. In the last stanzas, the speaker compares the dance he does from one side of his mind to the other to a battle. He is frustrated with living this way and longs for the border to “Cease to be”."

A scarlet poppy grew
And up it held its staring head,
And thrust it full in view.
Yet no attention did it win,
By all these efforts made,
And less unwelcome had it been
In some retired shade.
Although within its scarlet breast
No sweet perfume was found,
It seemed to think itself the best
Of all the flowers round,
From this I may a hint obtain
And take great care indeed,
Lest I appear as pert and vain
As does this gaudy weed.","A scarlet poppy grew and held its staring head, And thrust it full in","'The Poppy' by Jane Taylor describes a single, vain poppy flower boldly growing in the sunlight of a field and the speaker's distaste for its display. The poem begins with the speaker coming upon a “scarlet poppy” growing with abounding self-confidence in a prime spot on a hillside. The speaker is taken aback by this sight and surprised that such a flower would display itself so prominently. It is not clear at first why she feels this way, regarding what many agree is a beautiful flower. As the poem progresses her reasoning becomes clear. She states that the poppy would have been much more welcome in this “bed” if it had found somewhere less prominent to “thrust” it's “staring head.” She suggests a place in the shade, out of her direct view. The speaker continues on to state that it is due to the flower's lack of smell that she feels so disdainfully about its location and actions. She imbues the flower with the human ability to decide where it wants to grow and how it wants to look. This is a direct reference to how she, as a woman, would like to act and be seen. The speaker does not want to ever become as vain or “gaudy” as the poppy is and professes her determination to use the lesson of the poppy to maintain her moral strength."

The poem begins and ends with the same image, focusing completely on being within 'your arms', the beauty of human connection being the central focus of us.

It is important to note that it is not simply the trees that he misses, but the whole scene of which they were part, where water, air, and earth collided, to create a thing of wonder. Through the poem ‘Binsey Poplars’, he seems to work through the emotions of grief and sadness, anger, and finally wistfulness that this quietly glorious sight will never be available to future generations."

The speaker describes how hard it is to get up during this time of year and the way that a single candle does nothing to warm him. When he goes outside, his nurse wraps him up in numerous pieces of clothing, and he can observe the snow-covered landscape.

They have been fighting for an extended period of time and the woman has had enough. Throughout the following lines, she compares their situation to that of Adam and Eve.

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker acknowledges that life gets hard. When it does, one needs to focus on their immediate moment and what they can touch and change. This will make life easier to deal with than worrying about every eventuality would. The poet's speaker also emphasizes the importance of love and happiness in one's life. These things are the true purpose of life rather than the acquisition of material wealth. Listen to Kae reciting 'Hold Your Own' at Glastonbury here."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that all mothers are lovely and pitiful. They live hard, brave, and troubled lives that stay with their children. This is due to their graciousness in life and death. They (at least the good ones) give everything. The speaker uses the next lines to connect the experiences of those still living with those of the long dead. Her memories tell her that “we,” referring to the offspring of these dead mothers, did as their mothers did. They all worked hard, learned to live in their circumstances, were patient, and maintained hope in the face of fear. The poem concludes with the speaker wondering whether or not the mothers in Paradise can see their children below. Then, if they can, what do they think about the lives they are leading? Do they cry happy tears? Can her own mother bear to look at her?"

The poem starts with the soldier saying that the year is not one that one writes happy verses about. Instead, it was a terrible experience for everyone. He personifies the year, referring to it as he mentions various locations around the country. In this way, he's able to connect his experience to the year that the rest of the country saw/experienced."

At my baize table with a glass,
Now sipping my unfizzy beer,
Now looking out where on the grass

Two striped and crested hoopoes glean
Delicious insects one by one.
A barbet flies into the scene
Across the smoky city sun.

My friends have left, and I can see
No one, and no one will appear.
This must be happiness, to be
Sitting alone with birds and beer.

In a brief while the sun will go,
And grand unnerving bats will fly
Westward in clumped formations, slow
And dark across a darkened sky.","Evening is here, and I am here At my baize table with a glass,","'Evening Scene From My Table' by Vikram Seth is a calm, meditative poem that speaks on the beauty and pleasure to be found in time spent alone. The speaker in this piece is by himself at a table drinking “unfizzy beer”. He looks out from where he's sitting and takes note of the creatures going about their lives around him. No one and nothing interacts with him, and he is left to observe and find solace in the “birds and beer”. The poem concludes with a gentled reminder that soon the sun will go away and the “unnerving,” yet “grand,” bats will fly in dark formations “across a darkened sky.”"

And their white scuts flash at their vanishing heels,
And swallows abandon the hamlet-roofs.The mole’s tunnelled chambers are crushed by wheels,
The lark’s eggs scattered, their owners fled;
And the hedgehog’s household the sapper unseals.The snail draws in at the terrible tread,
But in vain; he is crushed by the felloe-rim.

To die of a worse than the weather-foe.Trodden and bruised to a miry tomb
Are ears that have greened but will never be gold,
And flowers in the bud that will never bloom.","The coneys are scared by the thud of hoofs, And their","'The Field of Waterloo' by Thomas Hardy describes the battlefield of Waterloo and how the little creatures suffer during the war. This poem depicts the scene of a battle. It is none other than the Battle of Waterloo of 1815. However, this poem does not deal with what humans think about the war. Rather it is about the creatures such as rabbits, moles, swallows, larks, etc. Throughout this piece, the poet captures the progress of the warhorses on the field. As an effect, those little creatures get affected. Lastly, the poet creates a horrid atmosphere through the portrayal of the suffering of the creatures. His main idea is everything is not going to be normal again after that war."

And grow into a cabinet minister.",I hope that the baby will prove Ignorant and stupid. Then he'll,"On The Birth of a Son by Su Tung-Po begins by discussing how when a 'child is born', the families hope that they are 'intelligent'. However, the poet describes how his life has been wrecked by his own intelligence, living an unhappier life than someone who was born 'stupid'. He wishes stupidity on newborns, allowing them to pass over the sad life path that he has followed. The final line of the poem is a political joke, suggesting that 'cabinet ministers' and politicians, in general, are stupid, lacking all 'intelligence'. Although published almost 1000 years ago, I believe a lot of modern audiences would agree with this final line."
777,777,777,"This morning as I walked along the lake shore, 
I fell in love with a wren 
and later in the day with a mouse 
the cat had dropped under the dining room table.

In the shadows of an autumn evening,
I fell for a seamstress
still at her machine in the tailor's window, 
and later for a bowl of broth, 
steam rising like smoke from a naval battle.

This is the best kind of love, I thought, 
without recompense, without gifts, 
or unkind words, without suspicion, 
or silence on the telephone.

The love of the chestnut,
the jazz cap and one hand on the wheel.

No lust, no slam of the door-
the love of the miniature orange tree,
the clean white shirt, the hot evening shower,
the highway that cuts across Florida. 

No waiting, no huffiness, or rancor- 
just a twinge every now and then

for the wren who had built her nest 
on a low branch overhanging the water 
and for the dead mouse, 
still dressed in its light brown suit.

But my heart is always standing on its tripod, 
ready for the next arrow.

After I carried the mouse by the tail
to a pile of leaves in the woods,
I found myself standing at the bathroom sink
gazing down affectionately at the soap,

so patient and soluble
so at home in its pale green soap dish.
I could feel myself falling again
as I felt its turning in my wet hands 
and caught the scent of lavender and stone.",I fell in love with a wren and later in the day with a mouse,"In ‘Aimless Love,’ the speaker describes falling in love with ordinary creatures and objects, beginning with a wren he saw along a walk on the lakeshore. He shifts between different memories, recalling his love for a hardworking seamstress he saw through a window, a bowl of broth, a clean white shirt, and even a Florida highway, although the most enduring image is that of a dead mouse. Throughout his recollections, the speaker compares his love for ordinary things with the problems that plague human romance, including lust and cruelty. As he meditates on how he carefully disposed of the mouse, the speaker subtly suggests that part of the beauty of life is its fragility, something that people often forget in their relationships with each other.

what could I say?

On stage, he’s a different person.

Up there he’s a king on a throne,

but at home you should hear him moan.

The moment he walks through that door

he seems to have the world on his shoulder.

I do me best to cheer him up, poor soul.

I juggle with eggs, I turn cartwheels,

I tell jokes, I do me latest card trick,

I even have a borrow of his red nose.

But he doesn’t say exactly how he feels,

doesn’t say what’s bothering him inside.

In the poem, the wife speaks of her clown husband. She shows the duality between his professional life and his personal life. However, she also tells us about herself. She is not just a passive observer relating information about her husband. No, she is an active participant in the story being told. The wife acts to cheer up her clown husband, taking on the role of a clown herself. So, there is an element of role reversal at play here."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that those who throw up their arms and wail do not truly grieve. They are without the ability to feel true despair. Rather, it is those who express no passion who are truly hurting. She counts herself among them. The speaker goes on to describe how in grief one's soul becomes like a desert and their body like a statue. There is nothing to remove them from this state. in fact, it gets worse every day as the sun (their troubles) beats down on them. In conclusion, she tells the reader that only when one can “weep” will their grief be relieved."

781,781,781,"There passed a weary time. Each throat
Was parched, and glazed each eye.
A weary time! a weary time!
How glazed each weary eye,

When looking westward, I beheld
A something in the sky.

At first it seemed a little speck,
And then it seemed a mist;
It moved and moved, and took at last
A certain shape, I wist.

A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!
And still it neared and neared:
As if it dodged a water-sprite,
It plunged and tacked and veered.

With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,
We could nor laugh nor wail;
Through utter drought all dumb we stood!
I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,
And cried, A sail! a sail!

With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,
Agape they heard me call:
Gramercy! they for joy did grin,
And all at once their breath drew in.
As they were drinking all.

See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!
Hither to work us weal;
Without a breeze, without a tide,
She steadies with upright keel!

The western wave was all a-flame.
The day was well nigh done!
Almost upon the western wave
Rested the broad bright Sun;
When that strange shape drove suddenly
Betwixt us and the Sun.

And straight the Sun was flecked with bars,
(Heaven's Mother send us grace!)
As if through a dungeon-grate he peered
With broad and burning face.

Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)
How fast she nears and nears!
Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,
Like restless gossameres?

Are those her ribs through which the Sun
Did peer, as through a grate?
And is that Woman all her crew?
Is that a DEATH? and are there two?
Is DEATH that woman's mate?

Her lips were red, her looks were free,
Her locks were yellow as gold:
Her skin was as white as leprosy,
The Night-mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she,
Who thicks man's blood with cold.

The naked hulk alongside came,
And the twain were casting dice;
'The game is done! I've won! I've won!'
Quoth she, and whistles thrice.

The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out;
At one stride comes the dark;
With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea,
Off shot the spectre-bark.

We listened and looked sideways up!
Fear at my heart, as at a cup,
My life-blood seemed to sip!
The stars were dim, and thick the night,
The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;
From the sails the dew did drip—
Till clomb above the eastern bar
The hornèd Moon, with one bright star
Within the nether tip.

One after one, by the star-dogged Moon,
Too quick for groan or sigh,
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,
And cursed me with his eye.

Four times fifty living men,
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,
They dropped down one by one.

The souls did from their bodies fly,—
They fled to bliss or woe!
And every soul, it passed me by,
Like the whizz of my cross-bow!","The sun was a whizz of the cross-bow, and the moon was","The third part of 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner' by Samuel Taylor Coleridge describes the “weary time” the sailors spend at sea. During this terrible period of time in the ship's journey, the sailors are incredibly parched. THere's a moment of hope when a speck comes close in the sky from the west, but due to their dehydration, no one can speak. The Mariner eventually bites his own arm and wets his lips with his blood. With this act, he's able to alert the crew to the ship on the horizon. Unfortunately, the joy turns to horror when they realize the ship is a ghost ship. The Mariner can see “Death” as a passenger on the ship as well as “Life-in-Death.” The two are playing dice for the crew and Life in Death has won the soul of the Mariner. The other sailors turn to curse the Mariner then one after the other the men drop dead on the ship."

In the first lines of this poem, the speaker talks to God, asking him to tone down nature if that pleases him. She wants the Eiger flattened, and the Grand Canyon made more bland. These changes should result in a far less overwhelming world, one that is less distracting and inspiring. Her request is clear sarcastic, meant to signal her broader appreciation for the natural world. The poem ends with a similar request, directed at God's grandeur itself."

Damn, says","‘Crow Testament’ by Sherman Alexie presents a picture of the hardships suffered by Native Americans through the metaphorical image of a crow. The poem begins with the speaker describing a scene from Genesis in which Cain kills his brother Abel. In this section, Crow is being used as a weapon. Additionally, the presence of Cain and Abel in the poem sets the stage for an intricate commentary about the way white men and women treat one another and the role made for Native Americans in this narrative. The narrative follows crow as he is taken advantage of by the white man in the form of a falcon, and abused by, and from within the wars that men wage. The poem continues on, passing more commentary on the way that man uses the bible to justify his actions. Native Americans are placed in the battle of Jericho and are born into the ashes of the fallen city. This is their past and future, as further represented in the following stanzas. Alexie’s speaker states that Crow is able, through the collection of beer bottles, to make 5 cents at a time. This pitiful amount is gained through the suffering of the population, many of whom are afflicted with alcoholism, and the suffering of Crow who is only able to take one bottle at a time. ‘Crow Testament’ concludes with Crow riding into a powwow on a pale horse. He is now representing Death, as portrayed in Revelations. No one is shocked to see him, it is as if it has been known from the beginning that “Death” is how their world would end. "

The lines of 'Postfeminism' are interesting and multilayered. The poem starts by drawing a line between women and soldiers or virgins and wolves. There are these two different type of people in the world, both fulfilling a role. It's from this initial premise that the rest of the poem spins off and “you” and “me” are put on opposite sides. There are different ways of addressing life and the speaker acknowledges these through complicated and sometimes confusing images."
785,785,785,"I sing the body electric,
The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them,
They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,
And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul.

Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves?
And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead?
And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul?
And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?

The love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body itself balks account,
That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect.

The expression of the face balks account,
But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face,
It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists,
It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees, dress does not hide him,
The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth,
To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more,
You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side.

The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards,
The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the water,
The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the horseman in his saddle,
Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,
The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting,
The female soothing a child, the farmer’s daughter in the garden or cow-yard,
The young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six horses through the crowd,
The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sun-down after work,
The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance,
The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes;
The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps,
The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the alert,
The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv’d neck and the counting;
Such-like I love—I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother’s breast with the little child,
Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, count.

I knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons,
And in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons.

This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person,
The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness and breadth of his manners,
These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also,
He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome,
They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him,
They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love,
He drank water only, the blood show’d like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face,
He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail’d his boat himself, he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him,
When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang,
You would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other.

I have perceiv’d that to be with those I like is enough,
To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,
To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough,
To pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then?
I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea.

There is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well,
All things please the soul, but these please the soul well.

This is the female form,
A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot,
It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction,
I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor, all falls aside but myself and it,
Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what was expected of heaven or fear’d of hell, are now consumed,
Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response likewise ungovernable,
Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all diffused, mine too diffused,
Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching,
Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice,
Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn,
Undulating into the willing and yielding day,
Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh’d day.

This the nucleus—after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman,
This the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the outlet again.

Be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest,
You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul.

The female contains all qualities and tempers them,
She is in her place and moves with perfect balance,
She is all things duly veil’d, she is both passive and active,
She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters.

As I see my soul reflected in Nature,
As I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness, sanity, beauty,
See the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the Female I see.

The male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place,
He too is all qualities, he is action and power,
The flush of the known universe is in him,
Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well,
The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost become him well, pride is for him,
The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul,
Knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to the test of himself,
Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes soundings at last only here,
(Where else does he strike soundings except here?)

The man’s body is sacred and the woman’s body is sacred,
No matter who it is, it is sacred—is it the meanest one in the laborers’ gang?
Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf?
Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off, just as much as you,
Each has his or her place in the procession.

(All is a procession,
The universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.)

Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant?
Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no right to a sight?
Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation sprouts,
For you only, and not for him and her?

A man’s body at auction,
(For before the war I often go to the slave-mart and watch the sale,)
I help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know his business.

Gentlemen look on this wonder,
Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it,
For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or plant,
For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll’d.

In this head the all-baffling brain,
In it and below it the makings of heroes.

Examine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in tendon and nerve,
They shall be stript that you may see them.

Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition,
Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby, good-sized arms and legs,
And wonders within there yet.

Within there runs blood,
The same old blood! the same red-running blood!
There swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires, reachings, aspirations,
(Do you think they are not there because they are not express’d in parlors and lecture-rooms?)

This is not only one man, this the father of those who shall be fathers in their turns,
In him the start of populous states and rich republics,
Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments.

How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries?
(Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace back through the centuries?)

A woman’s body at auction,
She too is not only herself, she is the teeming mother of mothers,
She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers.

Have you ever loved the body of a woman?
Have you ever loved the body of a man?
Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations and times all over the earth?

If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred,
And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted,
And in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is more beautiful than the most beautiful face.

Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool that corrupted her own live body?
For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves.

O my body! I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and women, nor the likes of the parts of you,

He also tries to bridge the gap between body and soul. He lists out several 'human bodies' of people of different professions and age groups beyond ethnicity. As the title suggests, he brings out the uniqueness of different body structures in away making it alive. In the first section of the poem, the poet states the similarities between the body and soul, arguing that the body doesn't corrupt the soul. In the next section, he discusses the various ways which make the body perfect. Further, he defines a “well-made man,” especially in terms of his body. Besides, he explores bodies belonging to babies, girls, mothers, swimmers, rowers, horsemen, and laborers. Whitman also recalls when he visited the farmer with five sons, “full of vigor, calmness, the beauty of person” even at the age of eighty. Further, he comments on the wonderful feeling gained by a person who is surrounded by beautiful human bodies. As the poem progresses, he also talks about the similarities and dissimilarities of the female and the male body. He further talks about the bodies of male and female sales at auction and expresses his condemnation of slavery. Here presented an underlining note that all bodies are equally sacred, despite the gender and race for everyone has the same red blood running through their veins. In the final section, Whitman lists out all characteristics of the human body that he admires and concludes that these features are not only markers of the human body, but that the body's “parts and poems” also represent the soul."

In the case of this poem, it is probably safe to assume that the speaker is Grace Nichols, who is writing a praise song in honor of her mother. Nichols uses a series of metaphors to show just how much her mother meant to her. The poem is five stanzas long, and each stanza, with the exception of the final two, is three lines each; the fourth stanza, the poem's longest, contains five lines. 'Praise Song For My Mother' ends with only one line in the final stanza. It reads, “Go to your wide futures, you said.”"

Muktibodh is a didactic poem that shows us how the negative side inside us not only destroys the positivity of mind but also harms the goodness of the whole humanity. In the poem 'The Void', Muktibodh depicts the void which we possess in our mind. It is generally a part of the subconscious mind in which our dark desires flourish. We can't neglect this dark side and this gloomy part of our mind makes us slaves. We serve this void by practicing anger, hatred, and demeaning someone. The more we do works that affect others, the more this dark side develops. It breeds its species into others. According to Muktibodh, it is like a communicable disease that is a threat to humanity."

The poem breaks down the period of waiting, in an unfamiliar environment, for the hospital to call with updates about sick children. For the parents that have children in the hospital, this place functions as a solitude, a place to wait nervously while the hospital works in the distance. The poem is restless, breaking down small aspects of the hotel, focusing restlessly on every detail. The final stanza of the poem ‘praise[s]’ the moment in which the parents find out their child is okay, and that they can all go home together."

The first person narrator of this poem recalls a memory from the childhood of an old woman that the children in the neighborhood referred to as “the Witch.” She comes to understand as she ages that she has become this woman and treated the woman from her youth unfairly. Not understanding at the time that she would become just like her. The speaker describes throughout the second stanza how she has become a hermit, just like the witch, and lives only with her overwhelming memories. Concluding that even though life may just be a “dream within a dream” she will continue to “[hold] [the] basket of fire,” and live on as best she can."

In total, ten commandments are given, just like in the Old Testament of the Bible.

The speaker begins the poem by noting that once she kissed her lover that there was no way she was ever going to want to be kissed by the winds of heaven again. Nothing can compare, she's saying. She also describes how she turns away from the sea winds in an effort to keep from losing his kiss on her mouth. The same perspective continues into the next lines. The speaker adds that she is her lover's forever. There is no way she'd ever want anyone else as they would pale in comparison to the person she's with now."

In which you had hopes for me
But sport was one of them.
On my twenty-first birthday
I was selected to play
For Grangegorman Mental Hospital
In an away game
Against Mullingar Mental Hospital.
I was a patient
In B Wing.
You drove all the way down,
Fifty miles,
To Mullingar to stand
On the sidelines and observe me.


I was fearful I would let down
Not only my team but you.
It was Gaelic football.
I was selected as goalkeeper.
There were big country men
On the Mullingar Mental Hospital team,
Men with gapped teeth, red faces,
Oily, frizzy hair, bushy eyebrows.
Their full forward line
Were over six foot tall
Fifteen stone in weight.
All three of them, I was informed,
Cases of schizophrenia.

There was a rumour
That their centre-half forward
Was an alcoholic solicitor
Who, in a lounge bar misunderstanding,
Had castrated his best friend
But that he had no memory of it.
He had meant well - it was said.
His best friend had to emigrate
To Nigeria.

To my surprise,
I did not flinch in the goals.
I made three or four spectacular saves,
Diving full stretch to turn
A certain goal around the corner,
Leaping high to tip another certain goal
Over the bar for a point.
It was my knowing
That you were standing on the sideline
That gave me the necessary motivation -
That will to die
That is as essential to sportsmen as to artists.

Having defeated Mullingar Mental Hospital
By 14 Goals and 38 points to 3 goals and 10 points -

The poem begins with the speaker describing an upcoming football game. His hospital's team is going to play against another hospital's team. The fact that the speaker is in the hospital is not really addressed in the text. It is another detail in the speaker's personal life that within the larger themes of the poem is not important. What is important is the speaker's relationship with his father. He drove him 50 miles to play this game and the son expresses his concern that he's going to be a disappointment. Despite the size, strength, and backstories of the other team, (who have their own problems and reasons for being in the hospital) he was not intimidated. The son knew, as goalkeeper that day, that he had to do everything he could to impress his father. He played very well, far from mediocre, which is exactly what he wanted. After the game, much to his astonishment and joy, his father was proud of him. He shook his hand and told him he'd done well. This is a moment in the speaker's life that he remembers clearly years later. The poem ends solemnly with the speaker addressing the fact that “Seldom if ever” was he to rise to these same heights in his father's eyes again."

Despite its first-person poetic voice, the principal theme of wanderlust is one that transcends the speaker and can be identified with by many.

The speaker pleads with the parents to do whatever they can to get their kids away from the televisions. He knows the kids will not react well to this change but it will be in their best interest. Eventually, they will have no choice but to turn to the books that should have always covered their walls. Once the change is made they'll thank their parents and love them more than ever."

In the beginning of the poem, Neruda presents a loving and romantic picture for his lover, reminding her of how much he loves her. However, towards the middle of the poem, his tone changes, warning her that if she stops loving him, he will also cease to love her. The tone in the last stanza of the poem reverts back to the positive, romantic tone in the first section of the poem, and the speaker tells his lover that if she does not forget him, if she keeps on loving him, he will forever love her in return. The poem highlights how intense, yet fickle, a love between a man and woman can be."

There was nobody to taste or appreciate the beauty of the place except insects, birds, and animals. Only the speaker was there, sorrowfully looking at the scene and heaving a sigh of loss.

Laura bow’d her head to hear,
Lizzie veil’d her blushes:
Crouching close together
In the cooling weather,
With clasping arms and cautioning lips,
With tingling cheeks and finger tips.
“Lie close,” Laura said,
Pricking up her golden head:
“We must not look at goblin men,
We must not buy their fruits:
Who knows upon what soil they fed
Their hungry thirsty roots?”
“Come buy,” call the goblins
Hobbling down the glen.

“Oh,” cried Lizzie, “Laura, Laura,
You should not peep at goblin men.”
Lizzie cover’d up her eyes,
Cover’d close lest they should look;
Laura rear’d her glossy head,
And whisper’d like the restless brook:
“Look, Lizzie, look, Lizzie,
Down the glen tramp little men.
One hauls a basket,
One bears a plate,
One lugs a golden dish
Of many pounds weight.
How fair the vine must grow
Whose grapes are so luscious;
How warm the wind must blow
Through those fruit bushes.”
“No,” said Lizzie, “No, no, no;
Their offers should not charm us,
Their evil gifts would harm us.”
She thrust a dimpled finger
In each ear, shut eyes and ran:
Curious Laura chose to linger
Wondering at each merchant man.
One had a cat’s face,
One whisk’d a tail,
One tramp’d at a rat’s pace,
One crawl’d like a snail,
One like a wombat prowl’d obtuse and furry,
One like a ratel tumbled hurry skurry.
She heard a voice like voice of doves
Cooing all together:
They sounded kind and full of loves
In the pleasant weather.

Laura stretch’d her gleaming neck
Like a rush-imbedded swan,
Like a lily from the beck,
Like a moonlit poplar branch,
Like a vessel at the launch
When its last restraint is gone.

Backwards up the mossy glen
Turn’d and troop’d the goblin men,
With their shrill repeated cry,
“Come buy, come buy.”
When they reach’d where Laura was
They stood stock still upon the moss,
Leering at each other,
Brother with queer brother;
Signalling each other,
Brother with sly brother.
One set his basket down,
One rear’d his plate;
One began to weave a crown
Of tendrils, leaves, and rough nuts brown
(Men sell not such in any town);
One heav’d the golden weight
Of dish and fruit to offer her:
“Come buy, come buy,” was still their cry.
Laura stared but did not stir,
Long’d but had no money:
The whisk-tail’d merchant bade her taste
In tones as smooth as honey,
The cat-faced purr’d,
The rat-faced spoke a word
Of welcome, and the snail-paced even was heard;
One parrot-voiced and jolly
Cried “Pretty Goblin” still for “Pretty Polly;”—
One whistled like a bird.

But sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste:
“Good folk, I have no coin;
To take were to purloin:
I have no copper in my purse,
I have no silver either,
And all my gold is on the furze
That shakes in windy weather
Above the rusty heather.”
“You have much gold upon your head,”
They answer’d all together:
“Buy from us with a golden curl.”
She clipp’d a precious golden lock,
She dropp’d a tear more rare than pearl,
Then suck’d their fruit globes fair or red:
Sweeter than honey from the rock,
Stronger than man-rejoicing wine,
Clearer than water flow’d that juice;
She never tasted such before,
How should it cloy with length of use?
She suck’d and suck’d and suck’d the more
Fruits which that unknown orchard bore;
She suck’d until her lips were sore;
Then flung the emptied rinds away
But gather’d up one kernel stone,
And knew not was it night or day
As she turn’d home alone.

Lizzie met her at the gate
Full of wise upbraidings:
“Dear, you should not stay so late,
Twilight is not good for maidens;
Should not loiter in the glen
In the haunts of goblin men.
Do you not remember Jeanie,
How she met them in the moonlight,
Took their gifts both choice and many,
Ate their fruits and wore their flowers
Pluck’d from bowers
Where summer ripens at all hours?
But ever in the noonlight
She pined and pined away;
Sought them by night and day,
Found them no more, but dwindled and grew grey;
Then fell with the first snow,
While to this day no grass will grow
Where she lies low:
I planted daisies there a year ago
That never blow.
You should not loiter so.”
“Nay, hush,” said Laura:
“Nay, hush, my sister:
I ate and ate my fill,
Yet my mouth waters still;
To-morrow night I will
Buy more;” and kiss’d her:
“Have done with sorrow;
I’ll bring you plums to-morrow
Fresh on their mother twigs,
Cherries worth getting;
You cannot think what figs
My teeth have met in,
What melons icy-cold
Piled on a dish of gold
Too huge for me to hold,
What peaches with a velvet nap,
Pellucid grapes without one seed:
Odorous indeed must be the mead
Whereon they grow, and pure the wave they drink
With lilies at the brink,
And sugar-sweet their sap.”

Golden head by golden head,
Like two pigeons in one nest
Folded in each other’s wings,
They lay down in their curtain’d bed:
Like two blossoms on one stem,
Like two flakes of new-fall’n snow,
Like two wands of ivory
Tipp’d with gold for awful kings.
Moon and stars gaz’d in at them,
Wind sang to them lullaby,
Lumbering owls forbore to fly,
Not a bat flapp’d to and fro
Round their rest:
Cheek to cheek and breast to breast
Lock’d together in one nest.

Early in the morning
When the first cock crow’d his warning,
Neat like bees, as sweet and busy,
Laura rose with Lizzie:
Fetch’d in honey, milk’d the cows,
Air’d and set to rights the house,
Kneaded cakes of whitest wheat,
Cakes for dainty mouths to eat,
Next churn’d butter, whipp’d up cream,
Fed their poultry, sat and sew’d;
Talk’d as modest maidens should:
Lizzie with an open heart,
Laura in an absent dream,
One content, one sick in part;
One warbling for the mere bright day’s delight,
One longing for the night.

At length slow evening came:
They went with pitchers to the reedy brook;
Lizzie most placid in her look,
Laura most like a leaping flame.
They drew the gurgling water from its deep;
Lizzie pluck’d purple and rich golden flags,
Then turning homeward said: “The sunset flushes
Those furthest loftiest crags;
Come, Laura, not another maiden lags.
No wilful squirrel wags,
The beasts and birds are fast asleep.”
But Laura loiter’d still among the rushes
And said the bank was steep.

And said the hour was early still
The dew not fall’n, the wind not chill;
Listening ever, but not catching
The customary cry,
“Come buy, come buy,”
With its iterated jingle
Of sugar-baited words:
Not for all her watching
Once discerning even one goblin
Racing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling;
Let alone the herds
That used to tramp along the glen,
In groups or single,
Of brisk fruit-merchant men.

Till Lizzie urged, “O Laura, come;
I hear the fruit-call but I dare not look:
You should not loiter longer at this brook:
Come with me home.
The stars rise, the moon bends her arc,
Each glowworm winks her spark,
Let us get home before the night grows dark:
For clouds may gather
Though this is summer weather,
Put out the lights and drench us through;
Then if we lost our way what should we do?”

Laura turn’d cold as stone
To find her sister heard that cry alone,
That goblin cry,
“Come buy our fruits, come buy.”
Must she then buy no more such dainty fruit?
Must she no more such succous pasture find,
Gone deaf and blind?
Her tree of life droop’d from the root:
She said not one word in her heart’s sore ache;
But peering thro’ the dimness, nought discerning,
Trudg’d home, her pitcher dripping all the way;
So crept to bed, and lay
Silent till Lizzie slept;
Then sat up in a passionate yearning,
And gnash’d her teeth for baulk’d desire, and wept
As if her heart would break.

Day after day, night after night,
Laura kept watch in vain
In sullen silence of exceeding pain.
She never caught again the goblin cry:
“Come buy, come buy;”—
She never spied the goblin men
Hawking their fruits along the glen:
But when the noon wax’d bright
Her hair grew thin and grey;
She dwindled, as the fair full moon doth turn
To swift decay and burn
Her fire away.

One day remembering her kernel-stone
She set it by a wall that faced the south;
Dew’d it with tears, hoped for a root,
Watch’d for a waxing shoot,
But there came none;
It never saw the sun,
It never felt the trickling moisture run:
While with sunk eyes and faded mouth
She dream’d of melons, as a traveller sees
False waves in desert drouth
With shade of leaf-crown’d trees,
And burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze.

She no more swept the house,
Tended the fowls or cows,
Fetch’d honey, kneaded cakes of wheat,
Brought water from the brook:
But sat down listless in the chimney-nook
And would not eat.

Tender Lizzie could not bear
To watch her sister’s cankerous care
Yet not to share.
She night and morning
Caught the goblins’ cry:
“Come buy our orchard fruits,
Come buy, come buy;”—
Beside the brook, along the glen,
She heard the tramp of goblin men,
The yoke and stir
Poor Laura could not hear;
Long’d to buy fruit to comfort her,
But fear’d to pay too dear.
She thought of Jeanie in her grave,
Who should have been a bride;
But who for joys brides hope to have
Fell sick and died
In her gay prime,
In earliest winter time
With the first glazing rime,
With the first snow-fall of crisp winter time.

Till Laura dwindling
Seem’d knocking at Death’s door:
Then Lizzie weigh’d no more
Better and worse;
But put a silver penny in her purse,
Kiss’d Laura, cross’d the heath with clumps of furze
At twilight, halted by the brook:
And for the first time in her life
Began to listen and look.

Laugh’d every goblin
When they spied her peeping:
Came towards her hobbling,
Flying, running, leaping,
Puffing and blowing,
Chuckling, clapping, crowing,
Clucking and gobbling,
Mopping and mowing,
Full of airs and graces,
Pulling wry faces,
Demure grimaces,
Cat-like and rat-like,
Ratel- and wombat-like,
Snail-paced in a hurry,
Parrot-voiced and whistler,
Helter skelter, hurry skurry,
Chattering like magpies,
Fluttering like pigeons,
Gliding like fishes,—
Hugg’d her and kiss’d her:
Squeez’d and caress’d her:
Stretch’d up their dishes,
Panniers, and plates:
“Look at our apples
Russet and dun,
Bob at our cherries,
Bite at our peaches,
Citrons and dates,
Grapes for the asking,
Pears red with basking
Out in the sun,
Plums on their twigs;
Pluck them and suck them,
Pomegranates, figs.”—

“Good folk,” said Lizzie,
Mindful of Jeanie:
“Give me much and many: —
Held out her apron,
Toss’d them her penny.
“Nay, take a seat with us,
Honour and eat with us,”
They answer’d grinning:
“Our feast is but beginning.
Night yet is early,
Warm and dew-pearly,
Wakeful and starry:
Such fruits as these
No man can carry:
Half their bloom would fly,
Half their dew would dry,
Half their flavour would pass by.
Sit down and feast with us,
Be welcome guest with us,
Cheer you and rest with us.”—
“Thank you,” said Lizzie: “But one waits
At home alone for me:
So without further parleying,
If you will not sell me any
Of your fruits though much and many,
Give me back my silver penny
I toss’d you for a fee.”—
They began to scratch their pates,
No longer wagging, purring,
But visibly demurring,
Grunting and snarling.
One call’d her proud,
Cross-grain’d, uncivil;
Their tones wax’d loud,
Their looks were evil.
Lashing their tails
They trod and hustled her,
Elbow’d and jostled her,
Claw’d with their nails,
Barking, mewing, hissing, mocking,
Tore her gown and soil’d her stocking,
Twitch’d her hair out by the roots,
Stamp’d upon her tender feet,
Held her hands and squeez’d their fruits
Against her mouth to make her eat.

White and golden Lizzie stood,
Like a lily in a flood,—
Like a rock of blue-vein’d stone
Lash’d by tides obstreperously,—
Like a beacon left alone
In a hoary roaring sea,
Sending up a golden fire,—
Like a fruit-crown’d orange-tree
White with blossoms honey-sweet
Sore beset by wasp and bee,—
Like a royal virgin town
Topp’d with gilded dome and spire
Close beleaguer’d by a fleet
Mad to tug her standard down.

One may lead a horse to water,
Twenty cannot make him drink.
Though the goblins cuff’d and caught her,
Coax’d and fought her,
Bullied and besought her,
Scratch’d her, pinch’d her black as ink,
Kick’d and knock’d her,
Maul’d and mock’d her,
Lizzie utter’d not a word;
Would not open lip from lip
Lest they should cram a mouthful in:
But laugh’d in heart to feel the drip
Of juice that syrupp’d all her face,
And lodg’d in dimples of her chin,
And streak’d her neck which quaked like curd.
At last the evil people,
Worn out by her resistance,
Flung back her penny, kick’d their fruit
Along whichever road they took,
Not leaving root or stone or shoot;
Some writh’d into the ground,
Some div’d into the brook
With ring and ripple,
Some scudded on the gale without a sound,
Some vanish’d in the distance.

In a smart, ache, tingle,
Lizzie went her way;
Knew not was it night or day;
Sprang up the bank, tore thro’ the furze,
Threaded copse and dingle,
And heard her penny jingle
Bouncing in her purse,—
Its bounce was music to her ear.
She ran and ran
As if she fear’d some goblin man
Dogg’d her with gibe or curse
Or something worse:
But not one goblin scurried after,
Nor was she prick’d by fear;
The kind heart made her windy-paced
That urged her home quite out of breath with haste
And inward laughter.

She cried, “Laura,” up the garden,
“Did you miss me?
Come and kiss me.
Never mind my bruises,
Hug me, kiss me, suck my juices
Squeez’d from goblin fruits for you,
Goblin pulp and goblin dew.
Eat me, drink me, love me;
Laura, make much of me;
For your sake I have braved the glen
And had to do with goblin merchant men.”

Laura started from her chair,
Flung her arms up in the air,
Clutch’d her hair:
“Lizzie, Lizzie, have you tasted
For my sake the fruit forbidden?
Must your light like mine be hidden,
Your young life like mine be wasted,
Undone in mine undoing,
And ruin’d in my ruin,
Thirsty, canker’d, goblin-ridden?”—
She clung about her sister,
Kiss’d and kiss’d and kiss’d her:
Tears once again
Refresh’d her shrunken eyes,
Dropping like rain
After long sultry drouth;
Shaking with aguish fear, and pain,
She kiss’d and kiss’d her with a hungry mouth.

Her lips began to scorch,
That juice was wormwood to her tongue,
She loath’d the feast:
Writhing as one possess’d she leap’d and sung,
Rent all her robe, and wrung
Her hands in lamentable haste,
And beat her breast.
Her locks stream’d like the torch
Borne by a racer at full speed,
Or like the mane of horses in their flight,
Or like an eagle when she stems the light
Straight toward the sun,
Or like a caged thing freed,
Or like a flying flag when armies run.

Swift fire spread through her veins, knock’d at her heart,
Met the fire smouldering there
And overbore its lesser flame;
She gorged on bitterness without a name:
Ah! fool, to choose such part
Of soul-consuming care!
Sense fail’d in the mortal strife:
Like the watch-tower of a town
Which an earthquake shatters down,
Like a lightning-stricken mast,
Like a wind-uprooted tree
Spun about,
Like a foam-topp’d waterspout
Cast down headlong in the sea,
She fell at last;
Pleasure past and anguish past,
Is it death or is it life?

Life out of death.
That night long Lizzie watch’d by her,
Counted her pulse’s flagging stir,
Felt for her breath,
Held water to her lips, and cool’d her face
With tears and fanning leaves:
But when the first birds chirp’d about their eaves,
And early reapers plodded to the place
Of golden sheaves,
And dew-wet grass
Bow’d in the morning winds so brisk to pass,
And new buds with new day
Open’d of cup-like lilies on the stream,
Laura awoke as from a dream,
Laugh’d in the innocent old way,
Hugg’d Lizzie but not twice or thrice;
Her gleaming locks show’d not one thread of grey,
Her breath was sweet as May
And light danced in her eyes.

Days, weeks, months, years
Afterwards, when both were wives
With children of their own;
Their mother-hearts beset with fears,
Their lives bound up in tender lives;
Laura would call the little ones
And tell them of her early prime,
Those pleasant days long gone
Of not-returning time:
Would talk about the haunted glen,
The wicked, quaint fruit-merchant men,
Their fruits like honey to the throat
But poison in the blood;
(Men sell not such in any town):
Would tell them how her sister stood
In deadly peril to do her good,
And win the fiery antidote:
Then joining hands to little hands
Would bid them cling together,
“For there is no friend like a sister
In calm or stormy weather;
To cheer one on the tedious way,
To fetch one if one goes astray,
To lift one if one totters down,
To strengthen whilst one stands.”","The goblins cry: “Come buy our orchard fruits, Come buy,","'Goblin Market' by Christina Rossetti describes the adventures of two sisters, Laura and Lizzie, and their encounter with goblin merchants. In the first lines of 'Goblin Market,' the poet describes the calls and cries of the goblin men as they try to attract customers to buy their fruits. These fruits are inherently magical, something that Lizzie, the wiser sister, knows they should stay away from. But, Laura ignores this warning and pays for one fruit with a lock of her hair. Once she eats it, Laura becomes immediately addicted to the taste. She demands more but the goblin refuses to give it to her. Laura wastes away pining after the fruit. Lizzie shows far more strength than Laura and finds a way to return her to her youth and beauty. Lizzie's sacrificial nature is often compared to Christ in these last lines. The poem concludes with the poet informing the readers that the two sisters each got married and had children. They learned their lesson from the Goblin Market."
802,802,802,"We shall not always plant while others reap
The golden increment of bursting fruit,
Not always countenance, abject and mute,
That lesser men should hold their brothers cheap;
Not everlastingly while others sleep
Shall we beguile their limbs with mellow flute,
Not always bend to some more subtle brute;
We were not made to eternally weep.

The night whose sable breast relieves the stark,
White stars is no less lovely being dark,
And there are buds that cannot bloom at all
In light, but crumple, piteous, and fall;
So in the dark we hide the heart that bleeds,
And wait, and tend our agonizing seeds.","We shall not always plant while others reap The golden increment of bursting fruit, Not always count","From the Dark Tower by Countee Cullen is a powerful piece of writing about the future of Black men, women, and children. In the first lines of 'From the Dark Tower,' the speaker begins by saying that “we,” Black men and women, aren't always going to be the ones doing all the hard work that others profit from. This suggests that now, that is the case. White people take the profit of the work that the speaker's community engages in. They won't always “countenance” or tolerate being treated as though they're inferior. The speaker says that “we” won't always have to submit to those who mistreat them or spend time thinking only about their suffering. The latter isn't going to last forever. In the second half of the sonnet, the speaker uses a metaphor to depict the Black community. He describes the sky as black and how just because it's dark doesn't mean it's any less beautiful or remarkable. Darkness has its pros, just as lightness does. There are some plants that can't live in the bright light of day. They instead bloom at night."
803,803,803,"The fat cat on the mat

Tolkien is a simple and upbeat poem that speaks on the dreams and true nature of a seemingly simple, soft, and calm house cat. The poem uses rhyme throughout the short lines that make up its stanzas in order to express a cat's dreams. He does not dream as one might first think. There aren't little mice and bowls of milk on his mind, rather the larger prey of another life. He thinks about living freely, like a lion. In his mind, he's able to feast on all creatures, including people. He will, contrary to how it seems, never forget what it means to live freely."
804,804,804,"In the walled garden, surrounded by cold marble
and rows of sanctioned lime trees, I grow

defenseless against desire—I almost touch
myself remembering your scent, time zones away,

clean first, then that sourness
after sex. My eye is a slow thief, it stops

for so little: under the orange tree, a young woman
lifts from her lover’s hair a praying mantis,

its green intelligence like calligraphy
on her hand. Children scream, a man wipes

oil with bread—people still go to lunch
within a war, can you believe it?

It is here I understand I am free, I am perpetual,
because it is you who hungers me.","I grow defenseless against desire, I almost touch myself remembering your scent, time zones away","'Gardens of Babur, Kabul' by Aria Aber is a romantic lyric describing the speaker's physical desire for her beloved while she calmly watches the serene beauty of the garden. This poem presents a description of the walled garden of Babur, situated in Kabul, Afghanistan. The marble walls give a cold sensation to the speaker's heart. Moreover, the natural setting lits warm desires of her heart. Therefore, she starts to miss her lover many “time zones away.” She remembers the tangy taste she felt after having sex. Thereafter, the speaker describes what others are doing in the garden. The image of a man wiping oil on bread, makes her feel hungry. But her hunger is rather the sexual one. Only her lover can quench her thirst."

The poem uses two different speakers, a man, and a woman, the latter is presumably the poet herself. The man asks her why it's so easy for her to be kind “to people.” She answers that people have not always been kind to her. In between these two statements, Kaur includes a striking image, that of milk and honey dripping from her lips, two substances that are meant to embody a feeling of nourishment and wholesomeness."
806,806,806,"St. Agnes' Eve—Ah, bitter chill it was!
The owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold;
The hare limp'd trembling through the frozen grass,
And silent was the flock in woolly fold:
Numb were the Beadsman's fingers, while he told
His rosary, and while his frosted breath,
Like pious incense from a censer old,
Seem'd taking flight for heaven, without a death,
Past the sweet Virgin's picture, while his prayer he saith.
His prayer he saith, this patient, holy man;
Then takes his lamp, and riseth from his knees,
And back returneth, meagre, barefoot, wan,
Along the chapel aisle by slow degrees:
The sculptur'd dead, on each side, seem to freeze,
Emprison'd in black, purgatorial rails:
Knights, ladies, praying in dumb orat'ries,
He passeth by; and his weak spirit fails
To think how they may ache in icy hoods and mails.
Northward he turneth through a little door,
And scarce three steps, ere Music's golden tongue
Flatter'd to tears this aged man and poor;
But no—already had his deathbell rung;
The joys of all his life were said and sung:
His was harsh penance on St. Agnes' Eve:
Another way he went, and soon among
Rough ashes sat he for his soul's reprieve,
And all night kept awake, for sinners' sake to grieve.
That ancient Beadsman heard the prelude soft;
And so it chanc'd, for many a door was wide,
From hurry to and fro. Soon, up aloft,
The silver, snarling trumpets 'gan to chide:
The level chambers, ready with their pride,
Were glowing to receive a thousand guests:
The carved angels, ever eager-eyed,
Star'd, where upon their heads the cornice rests,
With hair blown back, and wings put cross-wise on their breasts.
At length burst in the argent revelry,
With plume, tiara, and all rich array,
Numerous as shadows haunting faerily
The brain, new stuff'd, in youth, with triumphs gay
Of old romance. These let us wish away,
And turn, sole-thoughted, to one Lady there,
Whose heart had brooded, all that wintry day,
On love, and wing'd St. Agnes' saintly care,
As she had heard old dames full many times declare.
They told her how, upon St. Agnes' Eve,
Young virgins might have visions of delight,
And soft adorings from their loves receive
Upon the honey'd middle of the night,
If ceremonies due they did aright;
As, supperless to bed they must retire,
And couch supine their beauties, lily white;
Nor look behind, nor sideways, but require
Of Heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire.
Full of this whim was thoughtful Madeline:
The music, yearning like a God in pain,
She scarcely heard: her maiden eyes divine,
Fix'd on the floor, saw many a sweeping train
Pass by—she heeded not at all: in vain
Came many a tiptoe, amorous cavalier,
And back retir'd; not cool'd by high disdain,
But she saw not: her heart was otherwhere:
She sigh'd for Agnes' dreams, the sweetest of the year.
She danc'd along with vague, regardless eyes,
Anxious her lips, her breathing quick and short:
The hallow'd hour was near at hand: she sighs
Amid the timbrels, and the throng'd resort
Of whisperers in anger, or in sport;
'Mid looks of love, defiance, hate, and scorn,
Hoodwink'd with faery fancy; all amort,
Save to St. Agnes and her lambs unshorn,
And all the bliss to be before to-morrow morn.
So, purposing each moment to retire,
She linger'd still. Meantime, across the moors,
Had come young Porphyro, with heart on fire
For Madeline. Beside the portal doors,
Buttress'd from moonlight, stands he, and implores
All saints to give him sight of Madeline,
But for one moment in the tedious hours,
That he might gaze and worship all unseen;
Perchance speak, kneel, touch, kiss—in sooth such things have been.
He ventures in: let no buzz'd whisper tell:
All eyes be muffled, or a hundred swords
Will storm his heart, Love's fev'rous citadel:
For him, those chambers held barbarian hordes,
Hyena foemen, and hot-blooded lords,
Whose very dogs would execrations howl
Against his lineage: not one breast affords
Him any mercy, in that mansion foul,
Save one old beldame, weak in body and in soul.
Ah, happy chance! the aged creature came,
Shuffling along with ivory-headed wand,
To where he stood, hid from the torch's flame,
Behind a broad half-pillar, far beyond
The sound of merriment and chorus bland:
He startled her; but soon she knew his face,
And grasp'd his fingers in her palsied hand,
Saying, ""Mercy, Porphyro! hie thee from this place;
They are all here to-night, the whole blood-thirsty race!
""Get hence! get hence! there's dwarfish Hildebrand;
He had a fever late, and in the fit
He cursed thee and thine, both house and land:
Then there's that old Lord Maurice, not a whit
More tame for his gray hairs—Alas me! flit!
Flit like a ghost away.""—""Ah, Gossip dear,
We're safe enough; here in this arm-chair sit,
And tell me how""—""Good Saints! not here, not here;
Follow me, child, or else these stones will be thy bier.""
He follow'd through a lowly arched way,
Brushing the cobwebs with his lofty plume,
And as she mutter'd ""Well-a—well-a-day!""
He found him in a little moonlight room,
Pale, lattic'd, chill, and silent as a tomb.
""Now tell me where is Madeline,"" said he,
""O tell me, Angela, by the holy loom
Which none but secret sisterhood may see,
When they St. Agnes' wool are weaving piously.""
""St. Agnes! Ah! it is St. Agnes' Eve—
Yet men will murder upon holy days:
Thou must hold water in a witch's sieve,
And be liege-lord of all the Elves and Fays,
To venture so: it fills me with amaze
To see thee, Porphyro!—St. Agnes' Eve!
God's help! my lady fair the conjuror plays
This very night: good angels her deceive!
But let me laugh awhile, I've mickle time to grieve.""
Feebly she laugheth in the languid moon,
While Porphyro upon her face doth look,
Like puzzled urchin on an aged crone
Who keepeth clos'd a wond'rous riddle-book,
As spectacled she sits in chimney nook.
But soon his eyes grew brilliant, when she told
His lady's purpose; and he scarce could brook
Tears, at the thought of those enchantments cold,
And Madeline asleep in lap of legends old.
Sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose,
Flushing his brow, and in his pained heart
Made purple riot: then doth he propose
A stratagem, that makes the beldame start:
""A cruel man and impious thou art:
Sweet lady, let her pray, and sleep, and dream
Alone with her good angels, far apart
From wicked men like thee. Go, go!—I deem
Thou canst not surely be the same that thou didst seem.""
""I will not harm her, by all saints I swear,""
Quoth Porphyro: ""O may I ne'er find grace
When my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer,
If one of her soft ringlets I displace,
Or look with ruffian passion in her face:
Good Angela, believe me by these tears;
Or I will, even in a moment's space,
Awake, with horrid shout, my foemen's ears,
And beard them, though they be more fang'd than wolves and bears.""
""Ah! why wilt thou affright a feeble soul?
A poor, weak, palsy-stricken, churchyard thing,
Whose passing-bell may ere the midnight toll;
Whose prayers for thee, each morn and evening,
Were never miss'd.""—Thus plaining, doth she bring
A gentler speech from burning Porphyro;
So woful, and of such deep sorrowing,
That Angela gives promise she will do
Whatever he shall wish, betide her weal or woe.
Which was, to lead him, in close secrecy,
Even to Madeline's chamber, and there hide
Him in a closet, of such privacy
That he might see her beauty unespy'd,
And win perhaps that night a peerless bride,
While legion'd faeries pac'd the coverlet,
And pale enchantment held her sleepy-ey'd.
Never on such a night have lovers met,
Since Merlin paid his Demon all the monstrous debt.
""It shall be as thou wishest,"" said the Dame:
""All cates and dainties shall be stored there
Quickly on this feast-night: by the tambour frame
Her own lute thou wilt see: no time to spare,
For I am slow and feeble, and scarce dare
On such a catering trust my dizzy head.
Wait here, my child, with patience; kneel in prayer
The while: Ah! thou must needs the lady wed,
Or may I never leave my grave among the dead.""
So saying, she hobbled off with busy fear.
The lover's endless minutes slowly pass'd;
The dame return'd, and whisper'd in his ear
To follow her; with aged eyes aghast
From fright of dim espial. Safe at last,
Through many a dusky gallery, they gain
The maiden's chamber, silken, hush'd, and chaste;
Where Porphyro took covert, pleas'd amain.
His poor guide hurried back with agues in her brain.
Her falt'ring hand upon the balustrade,
Old Angela was feeling for the stair,
When Madeline, St. Agnes' charmed maid,
Rose, like a mission'd spirit, unaware:
With silver taper's light, and pious care,
She turn'd, and down the aged gossip led
To a safe level matting. Now prepare,
Young Porphyro, for gazing on that bed;
She comes, she comes again, like ring-dove fray'd and fled.
Out went the taper as she hurried in;
Its little smoke, in pallid moonshine, died:
She clos'd the door, she panted, all akin
To spirits of the air, and visions wide:
No uttered syllable, or, woe betide!
But to her heart, her heart was voluble,
Paining with eloquence her balmy side;
As though a tongueless nightingale should swell
Her throat in vain, and die, heart-stifled, in her dell.
A casement high and triple-arch'd there was,
All garlanded with carven imag'ries
Of fruits, and flowers, and bunches of knot-grass,
And diamonded with panes of quaint device,
Innumerable of stains and splendid dyes,
As are the tiger-moth's deep-damask'd wings;
And in the midst, 'mong thousand heraldries,
And twilight saints, and dim emblazonings,
A shielded scutcheon blush'd with blood of queens and kings.
Full on this casement shone the wintry moon,
And threw warm gules on Madeline's fair breast,
As down she knelt for heaven's grace and boon;
Rose-bloom fell on her hands, together prest,
And on her silver cross soft amethyst,
And on her hair a glory, like a saint:
She seem'd a splendid angel, newly drest,
Save wings, for heaven:—Porphyro grew faint:
She knelt, so pure a thing, so free from mortal taint.
Anon his heart revives: her vespers done,
Of all its wreathed pearls her hair she frees;
Unclasps her warmed jewels one by one;
Loosens her fragrant boddice; by degrees
Her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees:
Half-hidden, like a mermaid in sea-weed,
Pensive awhile she dreams awake, and sees,
In fancy, fair St. Agnes in her bed,
But dares not look behind, or all the charm is fled.
Soon, trembling in her soft and chilly nest,
In sort of wakeful swoon, perplex'd she lay,
Until the poppied warmth of sleep oppress'd
Her soothed limbs, and soul fatigued away;
Flown, like a thought, until the morrow-day;
Blissfully haven'd both from joy and pain;
Clasp'd like a missal where swart Paynims pray;
Blinded alike from sunshine and from rain,
As though a rose should shut, and be a bud again.
Stol'n to this paradise, and so entranced,
Porphyro gaz'd upon her empty dress,
And listen'd to her breathing, if it chanced
To wake into a slumberous tenderness;
Which when he heard, that minute did he bless,
And breath'd himself: then from the closet crept,
Noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness,
And over the hush'd carpet, silent, stept,
And 'tween the curtains peep'd, where, lo!—how fast she slept.
Then by the bed-side, where the faded moon
Made a dim, silver twilight, soft he set
A table, and, half anguish'd, threw thereon
A cloth of woven crimson, gold, and jet:—
O for some drowsy Morphean amulet!
The boisterous, midnight, festive clarion,
The kettle-drum, and far-heard clarinet,
Affray his ears, though but in dying tone:—
The hall door shuts again, and all the noise is gone.
And still she slept an azure-lidded sleep,
In blanched linen, smooth, and lavender'd,
While he forth from the closet brought a heap
Of candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd;
With jellies soother than the creamy curd,
And lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon;
Manna and dates, in argosy transferr'd
From Fez; and spiced dainties, every one,
From silken Samarcand to cedar'd Lebanon.
These delicates he heap'd with glowing hand
On golden dishes and in baskets bright
Of wreathed silver: sumptuous they stand
In the retired quiet of the night,
Filling the chilly room with perfume light.—
""And now, my love, my seraph fair, awake!
Thou art my heaven, and I thine eremite:
Open thine eyes, for meek St. Agnes' sake,
Or I shall drowse beside thee, so my soul doth ache.""
Thus whispering, his warm, unnerved arm
Sank in her pillow. Shaded was her dream
By the dusk curtains:—'twas a midnight charm
Impossible to melt as iced stream:
The lustrous salvers in the moonlight gleam;
Broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies:
It seem'd he never, never could redeem
From such a stedfast spell his lady's eyes;
So mus'd awhile, entoil'd in woofed phantasies.
Awakening up, he took her hollow lute,—
Tumultuous,—and, in chords that tenderest be,
He play'd an ancient ditty, long since mute,
In Provence call'd, ""La belle dame sans mercy"":
Close to her ear touching the melody;—
Wherewith disturb'd, she utter'd a soft moan:
He ceas'd—she panted quick—and suddenly
Her blue affrayed eyes wide open shone:
Upon his knees he sank, pale as smooth-sculptured stone.
Her eyes were open, but she still beheld,
Now wide awake, the vision of her sleep:
There was a painful change, that nigh expell'd
The blisses of her dream so pure and deep
At which fair Madeline began to weep,
And moan forth witless words with many a sigh;
While still her gaze on Porphyro would keep;
Who knelt, with joined hands and piteous eye,
Fearing to move or speak, she look'd so dreamingly.
""Ah, Porphyro!"" said she, ""but even now
Thy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear,
Made tuneable with every sweetest vow;
And those sad eyes were spiritual and clear:
How chang'd thou art! how pallid, chill, and drear!
Give me that voice again, my Porphyro,
Those looks immortal, those complainings dear!
Oh leave me not in this eternal woe,
For if thy diest, my Love, I know not where to go.""
Beyond a mortal man impassion'd far
At these voluptuous accents, he arose
Ethereal, flush'd, and like a throbbing star
Seen mid the sapphire heaven's deep repose;
Into her dream he melted, as the rose
Blendeth its odour with the violet,—
Solution sweet: meantime the frost-wind blows
Like Love's alarum pattering the sharp sleet
Against the window-panes; St. Agnes' moon hath set.
'Tis dark: quick pattereth the flaw-blown sleet:
""This is no dream, my bride, my Madeline!""
'Tis dark: the iced gusts still rave and beat:
""No dream, alas! alas! and woe is mine!
Porphyro will leave me here to fade and pine.—
Cruel! what traitor could thee hither bring?
I curse not, for my heart is lost in thine,
Though thou forsakest a deceived thing;—
A dove forlorn and lost with sick unpruned wing.""
""My Madeline! sweet dreamer! lovely bride!
Say, may I be for aye thy vassal blest?
Thy beauty's shield, heart-shap'd and vermeil dyed?
Ah, silver shrine, here will I take my rest
After so many hours of toil and quest,
A famish'd pilgrim,—sav'd by miracle.
Though I have found, I will not rob thy nest
Saving of thy sweet self; if thou think'st well
To trust, fair Madeline, to no rude infidel.
""Hark! 'tis an elfin-storm from faery land,
Of haggard seeming, but a boon indeed:
Arise—arise! the morning is at hand;—
The bloated wassaillers will never heed:—
Let us away, my love, with happy speed;
There are no ears to hear, or eyes to see,—
Drown'd all in Rhenish and the sleepy mead:
Awake! arise! my love, and fearless be,
For o'er the southern moors I have a home for thee.""
She hurried at his words, beset with fears,
For there were sleeping dragons all around,
At glaring watch, perhaps, with ready spears—
Down the wide stairs a darkling way they found.—
In all the house was heard no human sound.
A chain-droop'd lamp was flickering by each door;
The arras, rich with horseman, hawk, and hound,
Flutter'd in the besieging wind's uproar;
And the long carpets rose along the gusty floor.
They glide, like phantoms, into the wide hall;
Like phantoms, to the iron porch, they glide;
Where lay the Porter, in uneasy sprawl,
With a huge empty flaggon by his side:
The wakeful bloodhound rose, and shook his hide,
But his sagacious eye an inmate owns:
By one, and one, the bolts full easy slide:—
The chains lie silent on the footworn stones;—
The key turns, and the door upon its hinges groans.
And they are gone: ay, ages long ago
These lovers fled away into the storm.
That night the Baron dreamt of many a woe,
And all his warrior-guests, with shade and form
Of witch, and demon, and large coffin-worm,
Were long be-nightmar'd. Angela the old
Died palsy-twitch'd, with meagre face deform;
The Beadsman, after thousand aves told,
For aye unsought for slept among his ashes cold.","A bitter chill it was! The owl, for all his feathers, was","'The Eve of St. Agnes' by John Keats is a celebration of an idealized love between two beautiful and heroic characters. 'The Eve of St. Agnes' begins with the setting, the eve of the Feast of St. Agnes, January 20th (the Feast is celebrated on the 21st). It is horribly cold outside. A Beadsman, a professional man of prayer, is freezing in his church. He briefly hears music from the house that the church abuts. They are preparing a celebration and the guests all arrive in a burst of expensive clothing and plumage. Within the castle, Madeline, one of the main characters of this story is stuck dancing amongst the guests. She has been informed by older women that this is a night during which a virgin lady, after following certain rituals, might in her dreams see the image of her true love. She is distracted by these thoughts and unable to enjoy the dance. Farther away from the castle a man, Porphyro, who loves Madeline more than anything, is making his way to the house. He enters, unseen. If anyone finds him he knows that he will be killed. Madeline's family hates him and holds his lineage against him. While sneaking through the house he comes upon Angela, one of the servants. He begs her to bring him to Madeline's chamber so that he might show himself to her that night and solidify himself as her true love. After much complaining, she agrees and hides him until it is time. When Madeline finally enters the room, undresses, and falls to sleep, Porphyro is watching her. When he decides that she has fallen completely asleep he makes his approach and wakes her with the playing of a flute. She is ripped from a dream in which she was with a heavenly, more beautiful version of Porphyro and is aghast when she sees the real one. She believes for a moment that he is close to death. After much convincing Madeline realizes her mistake. Porphyro declares that the two should run away together, since now she knows he is her true love, and escape to a home he has prepared on the “southern moors.” They need to go now while the house is asleep so that her family does not murder him. The two are able to make it out of the home without arousing suspicion and 'The Eve of St. Agnes' concludes with two characters, Angela, and the Beadsman, dying; their death acting as a symbol of a new generation that is now the focus of the world. Additionally, this idealistically romantic Romantic poem is known to have been written shortly after Keats fell in love with Fanny Brawne."
807,807,807,"At the round earth's imagin'd corners, blow
Your trumpets, angels, and arise, arise
From death, you numberless infinities
Of souls, and to your scatter'd bodies go;
All whom the flood did, and fire shall o'erthrow,
All whom war, dearth, age, agues, tyrannies,
Despair, law, chance hath slain, and you whose eyes
Shall behold God and never taste death's woe.
But let them sleep, Lord, and me mourn a space,
For if above all these my sins abound,
'Tis late to ask abundance of thy grace
When we are there; here on this lowly ground
Teach me how to repent; for that's as good
As if thou'hadst seal'd my pardon with thy blood.","At the round earth's imagin'd corners, blow Your trumpets, angels","At the round earth's imagin'd corners, blow' by John Donne contains a speaker's description of Judgment Day and an appeal to God to forgive him his sins. The poem begins with the speaker directing angels at the corners of the earth to blow their trumpets and wake the dead. With this action, all those who have passed away, in all their “numberless infinites” will return to earth and seek out their bodies. From the first lines, it is clear this is a slightly altered description of the Christian apocalypse. The speaker describes how everyone will be able to take back their bodies. By the time a reader gets to the second half of the poem, lines nine through 12, a turn has occurred. Although the speaker seemed prepared for the end of the world in the first section, he changes his mind. He realizes he hasn't adequately repented for his own sins and begs God to teach him how to do it. The speaker states that if he were able to confess everything he has done to God, then it would be like receiving a blood pardon."

The poem begins with the speaker telling a young listener that they “begin this way”. The first thing a person has is their “hand” and then their “eye”. These things represent the powers of agency and determination. She also points to a “fish, blue and flat / on the paper”. In the second stanza she goes through a few colours, and then reveals that in fact there are far more colours in the world that we can ever know. Eventually, she returns to the importance of the hand and the word itself as floating “above your hand / like a small cloud over a lake”. It hovers, and it “anchors / your hand to this table”. In the last three lines the speaker refers to the earth, her child's life and her own as having a beginning and an ending. All of it can be seen here, in “your hand”."

The poem begins with the speaker describing how there are two types of trees and men. First, there are those who are readily given everything they need to survive. This type of person or tree never has to worry about where their food and water is going to come from. On the other hand, there are the trees and men who must fight, from birth, to survive. Their broken branches and scars are evidence of their ability to survive on and become “forest king[s].”"
811,811,811,"There’s an indescribable beauty in union
In two beings forming one new being
Entering each other’s world
Surrendering each other’s selves
Accepting the invitation to be everything to someone else
There’s an unparallelled bravery in union
In telling the one you love:
“The only way that we can truly win
Is if I think of you in everything I do
And honour every decision you faithfully include me in.”
Love gives union true meaning
It illuminates the path
It wants us to compromise, communicate and laugh
It wants us to elevate, appreciate without pride
Love is oblivious to the outside
Even with an audience of millions
Even when that love bears immortal significance
All of this is met with cordial indifference

They will always think of one another and enjoy the beauty of their lives together without worry about the spotlight on them. "
812,812,812,"The world is charged with the grandeur of God.
It will flame out, like shining from shook foil;
It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil
Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod?
Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;
And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;
And wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the soil
Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.
And for all this, nature is never spent;
There lives the dearest freshness deep down things;
And though the last lights off the black West went

Because the Holy Ghost over the bent

It will flame out, like shining from shook foil; It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil In the poem, 'God's Grandeur by Gerard Manley Hopkins, the poet says that the world is filled to the brim with God's glory and splendour. God's glory manifests itself in two ways. At times, it flames out with sudden brilliance, as when a silver foil is shaken and it gives out glints of light. At other times, this glory becomes apparent over a period of time, as when the oil crushed from olives slowly oozes out and gathers into a thick pool. It is this second way which here arrests the poet's attention. It is noteworthy in connection with God's grandeur, which is the subject of this sonnet, that Hopkins had made a special and exhaustive study of St. Ignatius Loyola's book, The Spiritual Exercises, in which occurs the following passage: See God living in his creatures, in matter, giving it existence; in plants, giving them life; in animals, giving them consciousness; in men, giving them intelligence. Think of God energizing, as though. He was actually at work, in every created reality, in the sky, in matter, plants and fruits, herds and the like; it is He who creates them and keeps them in being, He who confers life or consciousness, and so on. Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod? Generations have trod, have trod, have trod; Through these lines, the poet asks why people no longer heed God's rod or recognizes the just punishment of God. The divine rod both smites the sinner and heals him. The reason, for people's heedlessness is that they have become fatalistic towards their misfortunes. People's senses have grown dull both to pain and to its cause. Life has become a monotonous and weary routine for them. And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil; And wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the soil Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod. In these lines of 'God's Grandeur', the poet says that people's love for money has left an ugly mark on everything in the world. The beauty of Nature has been defaced by human toil. The dirt and smell of human selfishness has infected the whole world of Nature. The earth is now bare, having lost all living beauty. Man is insensitive to this bareness: his feet feel neither the hardness nor the softness of the earth. And for all this, nature is never spent; There lives the dearest freshness deep down things; And though the last lights off the black West went Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs — Because the Holy Ghost over the bent World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings. In the above six lines of 'God's Grandeur, the poet's religious faith rises above this pessimistic picture of human life. The poet is able to look from darkness to light, from night to day, from winter to spring. In the depths of Nature, there is a never-failing source of freshness, with which the earth is renewed every time when spring comes. It is the continued brooding of the Holy Ghost over the “bent” world, which brings forth renewed life from generation to generation. The Holy Ghost looks after mankind with the same protective care as a dove looks after its young ones."

The poem makes use of repetition in order to inform a black child, over and over, that they are strong and capable of anything they want to do. The speaker addresses the listener, a young black child, and tells him/her that they can do anything they choose if they set their mind to it. The poem concludes by alluding to a future that is different from the poet's contemporary present. This is a future that has not yet come to pass in America, making this poem as relevant now as it was then."

All these concerns plague her consciousness each day, until she finally learns in the final stanza to step outside, despite her anxiety, and sing to the world. Yet, Oliver understands this is not an easy thing to do, only achieving this when she has reached old age. Some argue that the poet is being slightly naive when writing that she just 'gave [anxiety] up', people suggesting that it is not simply that easy."

With the mention of angels watching as well, this moment looks almost rapturous, thereby serving as a strong beginning for the poem. Soon after, the persona describes the mockery to come. They tell their subject that this rapturous moment will cost them, friends, and family. However, the persona offers comfort from God and encouraging advice. They urge these repentant souls to hold fast to their newfound faith because the God to whom they've come rejoices over their salvation."

The poem begins with the speaker describing that setting. It was “spring-time” and “night-time” when he came to her. She was under the hawthorn tree and beneath a sky of stars. The speaker continues her description in the second stanza. Together they were in her bower and joined together in rest. There was an obvious closeness between the two as he was set against her “warm breast”. The poem concludes with the speaker telling the intended listener not to ask her what he told her in these moments. They are welcome instead to inquire about the birds, breeze, stars, and roses."
817,817,817,"Today, as I rode by,
I saw the brown leaves dropping from their tree
In a still afternoon,
When no wind whirled them whistling to the sky,
But thickly, silently,
They fell, like snowflakes wiping out the noon;
And wandered slowly thence
For thinking of a gallant multitude
Which now all withering lay,
Slain by no wind of age or pestilence,
But in their beauty strewed
Like snowflakes falling on the Flemish clay.","I saw the brown leaves dropping from their tree In a still afternoon, When no win","The Falling Leaves Analysis Despite the harsh realities that fit the historic context of November 1915, the poem, which can be read in full here, is a very calming piece. It follows a loose rhyming pattern; each line has a rhyming line that follows three lines later, resetting after six lines. The poem discusses a narrator who watches as leaves fall from a tree. There is no breeze as the leaves fall, so they simply drop to the ground to join a vast array of dead leaves on the ground. Given the historic nature of the poem (and the preface, “November 1915”), it is likely that the fallen leaves represent soldiers of war, who fall, one by one, only to collapse into a field of bodies (or perhaps a list of the dead) so vast their names, identities, and even physical bodies are simply lost forever. The poem references “for thinking of a gallant multitude,” which ties in a very sad theme connecting the poem to the frenzy of excitement for the war that might well have been the last positive things felt by the vast fields of the dead. The poem describes them as having died, “like snowflakes wiping out the noon.” This too is a very telling image — it depicts a scene of winter where, in the afternoon, the warmest time of day, snow begins to fall. The glorious metaphorical summer turns to a bitter winter as snowflakes start to fall — except instead of snowflakes, it is the bodies of soldiers that are covering the fields. The snowflakes metaphor appears again near the end of the poem. The winter analogies can be interpreted two ways; generally the silent, white blanket of snow is an image used as a metaphor for peacetime. Otherwise, it is indicative of the cold winter that essentially smothers and ends a great deal of plant life. The meaning seems to be dual here; for every snowflake, every body on the field, another unique life's struggle has ended, and the calm wording of the poem almost makes it seem as though the fields are peaceful. Alternatively, the image conjured by snowflakes is one made of a great many flakes, and it is a fitting analogy to point out exactly how many people have died fighting the war even as early in as 1915. The last line of the poem references the Flemish clay, though this might make more sense if it is referred to as “Flanders Fields” (“Flemish” typically refers to the people of Flanders in Belgium, near where a number of significant battles took place throughout the war). There is no physical location called Flanders Fields; the name was popularized by the poem In Flanders Fields); rather, the location refers to battles such as ones in Passchendaele and Ypres. When Margaret Cole saw and heard about World War One, she was an outsider, yes, but also a feminist watching only men die, and a pacifist strongly opposed to the war itself. The calm nature of The Falling Leaves is not a strong reflection of what she is best known for, but is a terrific tone to set on a piece that challenged common perceptions of the war effort. Its somber nature may have been what many needed to hear to reflect upon the purpose of the war, and it is likely that this was her intention in writing it. It is a sad chapter in human history when men fall like leaves and cover the ground like snowflakes. There is a vast array of poetry, music, and art that reflects the nature of this period, but few that can capture its sobriety and pain in quite the same way as could Margaret Postgate Cole when she watched the falling leaves."

The poem takes the reader through the basic reasons why the speaker believes there's no reason to feel melancholy. She taps into humanity's basic, decent nature, its strength, and goodness. Humans, she reminds the reader, are also animals and are just as much a part of the instinctual natural world as an ant is."

Swimmer","'You are the daughter of the sea' by Pablo Neruda is a beautiful love poem in which the speaker elaborates on how like the sea and the soil his lover is. Throughout this poem, Neruda's speaker compares his lover to the ocean, in its smooth purity and flowing waters, as well as to the soil and its bounty. She's capable of creating life just as she's able to control the movements of the sea. She has a beautiful power about her, something that only a woman could have, and he's entranced by it. In the end, the poet concludes with his speaker describing her safe in his arms. Despite her power, he's there to protect her and allow her to rest in her dreams."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that the world she lives in is as “Rich” as it is “silent.” It is flat, and covered in “miles of fresh-plowed soil.”This soil is extremely important as it gives those caring for its sustenance. It also plays host to “weeds” though, and is the cause of exhausted horses and men. The second half of the poem speaks on the experiences of “Youth” and how aging can be enhanced and impacted by growing up on the prairies. The land provides an important and inescapable backdrop to one's life."

823,823,823,"Even the bravest that are slain
Shall not dissemble their surprise
On waking to find valor reign,
Even as on earth, in paradise;
And where they sought without the sword
Wide field of asphodel fore’er,
To find that the utmost reward
Of daring should be still to dare.

The light of heaven falls whole and white
And is not shattered into dyes,
The light for ever is morning light;
The hills are verdured pasture-wise;
The angel hosts with freshness go,
And seek with laughter what to brave;—
And binding all is the hushed snow
Of the far-distant breaking wave.

And from a cliff-top is proclaimed
The gathering of the souls for birth,
The trial by existence named,
The obscuration upon earth.
And the slant spirits trooping by
In streams and cross- and counter-streams
Can but give ear to that sweet cry
For its suggestion of what dreams!

And the more loitering are turned
To view once more the sacrifice
Of those who for some good discerned
Will gladly give up paradise.
And a white shimmering concourse rolls
Toward the throne to witness there
The speeding of devoted souls
Which God makes his especial care.

And none are taken but who will,
Having first heard the life read out
That opens earthward, good and ill,
Beyond the shadow of a doubt;
And very beautifully God limns,
And tenderly, life’s little dream,
But naught extenuates or dims,
Setting the thing that is supreme.

Nor is there wanting in the press
Some spirit to stand simply forth,
Heroic in its nakedness,
Against the uttermost of earth.
The tale of earth’s unhonored things
Sounds nobler there than ’neath the sun;
And the mind whirls and the heart sings,
And a shout greets the daring one.

But always God speaks at the end:
‘One thought in agony of strife
The bravest would have by for friend,
The memory that he chose the life;
But the pure fate to which you go
Admits no memory of choice,
Or the woe were not earthly woe
To which you give the assenting voice.’

And so the choice must be again,
But the last choice is still the same;
And the awe passes wonder then,
And a hush falls for all acclaim.
And God has taken a flower of gold
And broken it, and used therefrom
The mystic link to bind and hold
Spirit to matter till death come.

’Tis of the essence of life here,
Though we choose greatly, still to lack
The lasting memory at all clear,

Nothing but what we somehow chose;
Thus are we wholly stripped of pride
In the pain that has but one close,
Bearing it crushed and mystified.",Even the bravest that are slain Shall not dissemble their,"‘The Trial by Existence’ by Robert Frost is a profound and complex poem that delves into the themes of bravery, sacrifice and the enigmatic nature of life. The poem explores the surprises that even the bravest individuals encounter upon awakening in a realm where valor reigns, resembling both earth and paradise. Those who seek a peaceful afterlife are met with the realization that the ultimate reward for their daring is to continue daring. The heavenly light remains pure and undivided, casting a morning-like glow on the verdant hills. Angelic beings exude freshness and laughter as they eagerly seek new challenges. Binding everything together is the serene, distant breaking of ocean waves."

The poem takes the reader through a stream of consciousness description of baseball. It focuses primarily on the speaker who is watching a ball move through the air. He questions it, himself, the game, and what will happen if he does and does not catch the ball. Everything is up in the air throughout this poem. It acts as a metaphor for life and major life events that determine our paths. If the speaker catches or does not catch the ball two very different things will happen."

The poem begins with the speaker suggesting that his lover “Drink to” him with only her eyes. He will reciprocate this act by, with his own eyes, pledging himself to her. This wordless communication is extremely intimate and is a suiting introduction to the dynamic which exists between the two. The poet is invested in comparing his love, and the indulgent way he participates in it, to drinking. He could find her love, if she placed it there, within a wine glass. In the last part of this stanza he says that the thirst he has for love could only be sated by the strongest, and most divine of drinks. In the second stanza, the speaker describes an interaction that he instigated. This situation is utilized as a perfect representation of how he sees his lover and how they communicate with one another. He sends her a “rosy wreath” and instead of keeping it, she sends it back to him after breathing on it. The speaker declares that the smell of the plant has been supplanted by the smells of his lover."

The same can be said for an ant who encounters the dead body of one of its comrades. It's not their job to care about it. The Queen gives out commands and everyone obeys without questioning her. The poem concludes with the description of ants' lives as “departmental.”"

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is one “who” is making his way through a “narrow stair.” This is a direct reference to the title, placing the speaker within Notre Dame cathedral. The pathway is cramped and loud with the sound of bells he knows are far off. In the next stanza, Rossetti's speaker relates the environment of the stairwell and how he felt within it, to France as a whole. There is a storm pressing down on the country. The people have become restless and ready for a change. This is a reference to the February Revolution that took place in France in 1848. It was just one of a number of revolutionary movements in Europe aimed at ridding the continent of monarchical rule. The storm is building at a distance from the country, but it feels very close. It might come into the city center, or it might blow itself out at sea. He also posits the possibility that it moves on to another country and works away at another population. Whatever the case may be, the speaker knows that eventually France will escape from underneath the dark skies and step out into the light."

Heavy and dull as lead.

From such a lethargy?
How can I break these iron chains,
And set my spirit free?

In anguish o'er the past;
And raised my suppliant hands on high,
While tears fell thick and fast,

And prayed to have my sins forgiven
With such a fervent zeal,
An earnest grief --- a strong desire
That now I cannot feel!

And vowed to trample on my sins,
And called on Heaven to aid
My spirit in her firm resolves
And hear the vows I made.

So strong in spirit then,
As if my heart would never cool
Or wander back again.

And yet, alas! how many times

How oft have I forgot my God,
How greatly fallen away!

And Hope within me dies,

And hear a wretch's prayer.","I have gone backward in the work, The labour has not sped, Drow","'Despondency' by Anne Brontë is a Christian poem revealing the thoughts of a speaker on their waning passion for God. 'Despondency' begins with the speaker's “aha” moment. It suddenly dawns on the poet persona that their “work” has regressed. (Later in the poem, readers get to know the speaker's “work” is seeking God.) They mention how weak their spirit has become—hinting at the spirituality of the poem—before asking how they can be free from fatigue. Readers begin to understand the urgency of the speaker's question as they glimpse moments of intense passion from the speaker's past. The persona's craving for God so deeply that they cried often provides a sharp contrast to their present state. Though the speaker doesn't reveal how they'd got to that state, recalling their past grieves them. Towards the end of the poem, grief leads to lamentation. The speaker moans about how they walked away from their work and expresses a strong desire to return to it. In conclusion, the outburst simmers down and the speaker becomes more hopeful. They encourage themselves to pray—and “not despair”—for their passion for God to be rekindled."

The poem begins with the speaker complimenting the way a train runs. When one passes “beyond the Missouri” everything goes calm. The speaker personifies the train, describing how its wheels turn so smoothly that they seem to be “glad to go” down the track. Or, later on, that they run as if they have youthful energy. Once over the Missouri River, everything seems calm because all the dangerous bits of the road are left behind. The speaker is moving closer and closer to her home, and whatever happiness she feels is projected onto the train."

And saw the skull beneath the skin;

Leaned backward with a lipless grin.

Stared from the sockets of the eyes!

Tightening its lusts and luxuries.

To seize and clutch and penetrate;

Eliot describes the connection between life, death, love, and sex and how ultimately death becomes the most important thing in life. The poem begins with the speaker describing how John Webster, a dramatist, thought about life and death. He, as well as other writers such as John Donne, saw the truth of death beneath life. They were able to use their own knowledge to investigate deeper and discover its presence within everyone's bones. The second half of the poem introduces sex into life. There is one character of note, Grishkin, who is used as a representative of life and passion. She is a sexual person but even when one enters into her breast they will find cold bones and eventual death. The poem ends with the speaker describing how the study of the presence of death will become all consuming. "

She details what will be their ups, downs, and intense emotional connection. The poem begins with the speaker outlining a number of facts about love and what occurs around the emotion. There are not any details regarding who the listener of this piece is, but one can assume it is someone who is about to be or has just started falling in love. The speaker is giving advice to this person in the form of summarizing what love is really like. She states that “you” will begin to see through his eyes and feel what he feels even when “you” are separated. The feelings will be so intense “you” cannot even look into his eyes or comprehend moments when the door is “shut.” The poem concludes with the speaker describing the difficult process of coming to terms with what being in love is like. She speaks from experience about how the “Column of Gold” that initially represents a relationship might become “the commonest ash.” This occurs when problems become more universally understood. "

In this poem, Masters highlights how it is important to follow one's passion rather than running after money and wealth. Throughout the poem, he draws contrast upon the life led by an opportunistic farmer and an inspired musician. Fiddler Jones refers to farmer Cooney Potter who had turned his share of forty acres into a thousand and still aimed for more. In the eyes of Jones, a person could see two things by looking at a farm: one, an opportunity for wealth, and two, a walk in the meadow which would be a great memory someday. Whenever Jones thought of plowing, someone came along to make him play his fiddle, which he did not mind because he enjoyed it. Fiddler Jones was one of the few characters in Spoon River who did not have many regrets, and this poem explains a part of the reason behind his confident statement, “I ended up with forty acres … And not a single regret.”"

'A Poor Christian Looks at the Ghetto' by Czeslaw Milosz depicts the condition of the Warsaw Ghetto after the Germans demolished it. In the first two stanzas, the poet describes how the ghetto was destroyed. In the third stanza, the poet talks about a “guardian mole” that is somehow finding its way in between the corpses. The following stanza captures an ironic reference to the mole as a “Patriarch”. And in the final stanza, it becomes clear from whose perspective the poet picturizes the whole plot of the poem. The person is a “Jew of the New Testament” who appears as a survivor of the holocaust. After seeing such a heinous scene, he feels himself a sinner. The picture of the innocent men from his community lying in front of him makes him feel as if he is one of the “helpers of death”."

In the poem's first lines, the speaker begins by noting that far down within the city, a wind is trapped. Its moaning drowns out the sounds of children laughing as it longs for an escape from the cityscape. It's seeking a new world, one that's filled with nature and freedom. The wind, the speaker says, is longing to blow along the seashore. It wants to drift schooners and move birds through the sky. The poem ends with a clear allusion to freedom, allowing the reader to connect the wind's longing to any experience of their own."

This required sweeping them off the ceiling and dealing with them falling to the ground and into their hair. The speaker was relieved after the task was done but, as time passed, she started to feel regret and considered what she'd done as murder. The roaches were living the best they could, and her fingers, like blades, had killed them."

In the stanzas of 'The Sea and the Hills,' Kipling's speaker asks readers to consider the many varied elements of the ocean. He uses personification, describing the ocean as “she” and depicting all of “her” unruly features. On the sea, sailors are at risk from all sides. Anything can happen, including being blown out of control by unpredictable and predictable winds and running into an iceberg in foggy weather. Throughout the text, Kipling also compares the desire to return to the sea, as one's ancestors have throughout time, to a perhaps more relatable desire to be on dry land, a symbol for home and safety."

The poem begins with the speaker describing her own emotions when she is confronted with a potential lover. The man, just through his presence, is able to make her feel the “notions of” her kind. Her female biology makes her desire him whether her brain wants to or not. It is a feeling of “zest” she gets for the weight of him upon her. She knows, from experience, and from what she has been taught, that sex is meant to be a way that a man comes to possess a woman. The overpowering emotions that come along with it can cloud a woman's mind until she cannot see or think straight. Many believe this is how it has to be, but it is not. In the final section, she describes how she has the power to walk away from any man she chooses. She can be with a man, and then leave him if they have no emotional or mental connection. She is not made to be possessed."

Is it the waves or something else? However, from the following, Neruda starts to answer his question. Being a young man, the process seems tough for the speaker.

The poem begins with the poet relaying the words of one colonel to another. The first gives his imperialistic opinion of the Irish. He thinks of them as less than fully human and in need of suffering in order to occupy themselves. The Famine, in his mind, is not something they really need to worry about, aside from making sure they don't rebel. There is a response, asking if it would be possible for a road project to be started. This project is what the title, 'The Famine Road,' refers to. The English created employment for these poor by starving people building roads that went nowhere and had no end. Inside this narrative of pain, suffering, and death there is a second story. It is told in brief tercets from the perspective of a doctor and then his patient, an infertile woman. Through the juxtaposition of these two separate narratives connections are made. The woman is given the last three lines of 'The Famine Road' and compares her own infertile, “Barren” body to the purposeless, destination-less nature of the Famine roads."

The place where I again think of you, a new
Harmony of thoughts! I love you as the sunlight leads the prow

This poem is written to someone, Koch presenting his love through the dedicated poem. Koch discusses human emotions and how freeing love can be. He moves through similes of 'big blue sea', 'kid searches for a goat', 'Africa of green and white fields', 'a ship which sails', and finally 'dawn'. Each image is unique and beautiful in its own way, with one thing I particularly love about this poem is how varied and creative Koch's sources become. It is a beautiful poem, coming to an end within the image of 'sunlight', a classic image of happiness and growth."

The poem begins with the speaker telling the listener that she belongs to her husband totally. All parts of her have been given to his warmth. He is absent at this point though, traveling far from her as the sun moves from the earth during the winter months. She frequently compares him to the sun and herself to earth. The speaker freezes without his presence and will only feel whole again when he returns to her “in Cancer.”"

It shows that we are not always as unlike as is suggested. The first person narrative for both poems works really well. It is fun to see things from two different perspectives. The fact that the poem from the male perspective is longer suggests that perhaps he has more to say? Or perhaps that he is overthinking, although the content suggests they are both doing that. The poem is filled with irony in that the two characters are clearly very similar and clearly enamored by one another but are both pretending to like classical music when in reality the fact that neither of them actually does is something that they have in common."

The poem begins with the speaker describing the strength of her forbearers, particularly, the female ones. These women to whom she is related, either by blood or race, were forced to labor on plantations and farmlands. They were extraordinarily sturdy in their dispositions and physical ability as they “bent to toil.” These women were extremely strong in both mind and body. In the second stanza Walker continues to speak on all that her female ancestors had to go through. Their memories are rich with painfully strong memories that the speaker seems to be able to get a glance of. These women persevered and even though they suffered greatly, they still have “many clean words to say.” In the final lines of the poem the speaker asks whys is not as strong as they are."

In the first lines of this piece, the speaker comes upon a creature in the desert. He's squatting on the ground with his half-eaten heart in his hands. Rather than try to stop the creature from engaging in this act of self-destruction, the speaker expresses wonder at the act and asks him whether or not his heart is good. The creature responds, saying it's “bitter,” but he likes it because of this specific taste and because it's his own heart. He's taking joy, a greedy joy, from the act of consuming a part of himself."

It's traveled and traveled, and now she's cutting it up, and it's falling apart perfectly. This is something that goes unappreciated by most people, and she wants to rectify that at this moment. She adds in the second half that the onion has a right to make people cry. It's continually being ignored in meals in favor of the meat or the smell, and this is how it gets people's attention.

Draw round my bed: is Anselm keeping back?
Nephews—sons mine . . . ah God, I know not! Well—
She, men would have to be your mother once,
Old Gandolf envied me, so fair she was!
What's done is done, and she is dead beside,
Dead long ago, and I am Bishop since,
And as she died so must we die ourselves,
And thence ye may perceive the world's a dream.
Life, how and what is it? As here I lie
In this state-chamber, dying by degrees,
Hours and long hours in the dead night, I ask
""Do I live, am I dead?"" Peace, peace seems all.
Saint Praxed's ever was the church for peace;
And so, about this tomb of mine. I fought
With tooth and nail to save my niche, ye know:
—Old Gandolf cozened me, despite my care;
Shrewd was that snatch from out the corner South
He graced his carrion with, God curse the same!
Yet still my niche is not so cramped but thence
One sees the pulpit o' the epistle-side,
And somewhat of the choir, those silent seats,
And up into the aery dome where live
The angels, and a sunbeam's sure to lurk:
And I shall fill my slab of basalt there,
And 'neath my tabernacle take my rest,
With those nine columns round me, two and two,
The odd one at my feet where Anselm stands:
Peach-blossom marble all, the rare, the ripe
As fresh-poured red wine of a mighty pulse.
—Old Gandolf with his paltry onion-stone,
Put me where I may look at him! True peach,
Rosy and flawless: how I earned the prize!
Draw close: that conflagration of my church
—What then? So much was saved if aught were missed!
My sons, ye would not be my death? Go dig
The white-grape vineyard where the oil-press stood,
Drop water gently till the surface sink,
And if ye find . . . Ah God, I know not, I! ...
Bedded in store of rotten fig-leaves soft,
And corded up in a tight olive-frail,
Some lump, ah God, of lapis lazuli,
Big as a Jew's head cut off at the nape,
Blue as a vein o'er the Madonna's breast ...
Sons, all have I bequeathed you, villas, all,
That brave Frascati villa with its bath,
So, let the blue lump poise between my knees,
Like God the Father's globe on both His hands
Ye worship in the Jesu Church so gay,
For Gandolf shall not choose but see and burst!
Swift as a weaver's shuttle fleet our years:
Man goeth to the grave, and where is he?
Did I say basalt for my slab, sons? Black—
'Twas ever antique-black I meant! How else
Shall ye contrast my frieze to come beneath?
The bas-relief in bronze ye promised me,
Those Pans and Nymphs ye wot of, and perchance
Some tripod, thyrsus, with a vase or so,
The Saviour at his sermon on the mount,
Saint Praxed in a glory, and one Pan
Ready to twitch the Nymph's last garment off,
And Moses with the tables . . . but I know
Ye mark me not! What do they whisper thee,
Child of my bowels, Anselm? Ah, ye hope
To revel down my villas while I gasp
Bricked o'er with beggar's mouldy travertine
Which Gandolf from his tomb-top chuckles at!
Nay, boys, ye love me—all of jasper, then!
'Tis jasper ye stand pledged to, lest I grieve.
My bath must needs be left behind, alas!
One block, pure green as a pistachio-nut,
There's plenty jasper somewhere in the world—

Horses for ye, and brown Greek manuscripts,
And mistresses with great smooth marbly limbs?
—That's if ye carve my epitaph aright,
Choice Latin, picked phrase, Tully's every word,
No gaudy ware like Gandolf's second line—
Tully, my masters? Ulpian serves his need!
And then how I shall lie through centuries,
And hear the blessed mutter of the mass,
And see God made and eaten all day long,
And feel the steady candle-flame, and taste
Good strong thick stupefying incense-smoke!
For as I lie here, hours of the dead night,
Dying in state and by such slow degrees,
I fold my arms as if they clasped a crook,
And stretch my feet forth straight as stone can point,
And let the bedclothes, for a mortcloth, drop
Into great laps and folds of sculptor's-work:
And as yon tapers dwindle, and strange thoughts
Grow, with a certain humming in my ears,
About the life before I lived this life,
And this life too, popes, cardinals and priests,

Your tall pale mother with her talking eyes,
And new-found agate urns as fresh as day,
And marble's language, Latin pure, discreet,
—Aha, ELUCESCEBAT quoth our friend?
No Tully, said I, Ulpian at the best!
Evil and brief hath been my pilgrimage.
All lapis, all, sons! Else I give the Pope
My villas! Will ye ever eat my heart?
Ever your eyes were as a lizard's quick,
They glitter like your mother's for my soul,
Or ye would heighten my impoverished frieze,
Piece out its starved design, and fill my vase
With grapes, and add a vizor and a Term,
And to the tripod ye would tie a lynx
That in his struggle throws the thyrsus down,
To comfort me on my entablature
Whereon I am to lie till I must ask
""Do I live, am I dead?"" There, leave me, there!
For ye have stabbed me with ingratitude
To death—ye wish it—God, ye wish it! Stone—
Gritstone, a-crumble! Clammy squares which sweat
As if the corpse they keep were oozing through—
And no more lapis to delight the world!
Well, go! I bless ye. Fewer tapers there,
But in a row: and, going, turn your backs
—Ay, like departing altar-ministrants,
And leave me in my church, the church for peace,

On his death bed, rather than hoping for the life to come or being thankful, he had devoted his life to serving God, this bishop is filled with feelings of fear, regret, petty materialism, and even jealousy. ‘The Bishop Orders His Tomb’ is ironic in its very nature as this man who, most of his life, was looked to as a religious authority figure, gloats in his sins including an affair and a love for material wealth. He mentions various possibilities of what might happen to him when he dies, but ultimately seems convinced that he will stay right there in his tomb for all of eternity. Every belief, feeling, and request that this bishop expresses reveals that in his heart, he believes exactly the opposite of what he has taught throughout his life."

When the narrator reaches a sense of clarity in what they are saying the stanzas return to three lines long.

In the first few lines of the poem, the poet begins by having the speaker describe a young mother walking with two little shadows following her around.

They are beauty, kindness, and faithfulness, or as the speaker says, “Fair, kind, and true.” He concludes the poem by saying that since his love is so constant, so too will his verse be.

The speaker begins by describing how she will leave the world behind when the “last gold grape” is gone and the “last white antelope killed.” She is referencing the beautiful fascination that rare or revered objects hold in the world and how she has no desire to live in this world without them. She will cease her battles against mundanity and “escape” to a house she is planning to build. To do so she will need to shrink to “fairy size” and by doing so confound those that would seek to understand her. The world is so consumed by its own tedious problems, lacking in fascination, no one will be able to see or grasp what has happened to her. Their hands will be unwieldy, like mud, and their eyes blind as if obscured by cataracts. In the third stanza, the speaker describes how after she is gone others will search for her in the roots and branches of trees, but they will not find her. The monotonous nature of their lives will have blinded them to the more beautiful aspects of the world that still exist."

Funny things are everywhere.
Here are some who like to run.
They run for fun in the hot, hot sun.
Oh me! Oh my! Oh me! oh my!
What a lot of funny things go by.
Some have two feet and some have four.
Some have six feet and some have more.
Where do they come from? I can't say.
But I bet they have come a long, long way.
we see them come, we see them go.
Some are fast. Some are slow.
Some are high. Some are low.
Not one of them is like another.
Don't ask us why, go ask your mother.


Say! Look at his fingers!
One, two, three...
How many fingers do I see?
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
He has eleven!
Eleven! This is something new.
I wish I had eleven too!

Bump! Bump! Bump!
Did you ever ride a Wump?
We have a Wump with just one hump.
But we know a man called Mr. Gump.
Mr. gump has a seven hump Wump. So...
If you like to go Bump! Bump!
Just jump on the hump of the Wump of Gump

Who am I? My name is Ned
I do not like my little bed.
This is no good. This is not right.
My feet stick out of bed all night.
And when I pull them in, Oh, Dear!
My head sticks out of bed up here!

We like our bike. It is made for three.
Our Mike sits up in back, you see.
We like our Mike, and this is why:
Mike does all the work when the hills get high.


Hello there, Ned. How do you do?
Tell me, tell me what is new?
How are things in your little bed?
What is new? Please tell me Ned.
I do not like this bed at all.
a lot of things have come to call.
A cow, a dog, a cat, a mouse.
Oh! What a bed! Oh! What a house!

Oh dear, oh dear! I cannot hear.
Will you please come over near?
Will you please look in my ear?
There must be something there, I fear.
Say look! A bird was in your ear.
But he is out. So have no fear.
Again your ear can hear, my dear.

My hat is old, my teeth are gold.
I have a bird I like to hold.
My shoe is off, my foot is cold.
My shoe is off, my foot is cold.
I have a bird I like to hold.
My hat is old, my teeth are gold.
And now my story is all told.

We took a look. We saw a Nook.
On his head he had a hook.
On his hook he had a book.
On his book was ""How to Cook""
We saw him sit and try to cook
But a Nook can't read, so a Nook can't Cook.
SO...
What good to a Nook is a hook cook book?


the moon was out and we saw some sheep.
We saw some sheep take a walk in their sleep.
by the light of the moon, by the light of a star;
They walked all night from near to far.
I would never walk. I would take a car.

I do not like this one so well.
all he does is yell, yell, yell.
I will not have this one about.
When he comes in I put him out.
This one is quiet as a mouse.
I like to have him in the house.

At our house we open cans.
We have to open many cans.
and that is why we have a Zans.
A Zans for cans is very good.
Have you a Zans for cans? You should.

I like to box. How I like to box.
So every day I box a Gox.
In yellow socks I box my Gox.
I box in yellow Gox box socks.

It is fun to sing if you sing with a Ying.
My Ying can sing like anything.
I sing high and my Ying sings low.
And we are not too bad, you know.

this one, I think, is called a Yink.
he likes to wink, he likes to drink.
He likes to drink, and drink, and drink.
the thing he likes to drink is ink.
The ink he likes to drink is pink.
He likes to wink and drink pink ink.
SO...
If you have a lot of ink,
you should get a Yink, I think.

Hop, hop, hop! I am a Yop
All I like to do is hop,
From finger top to finger top.
I hop from left to right and then...
Hop, hop! I hop right back again.
I like to hop all day and night.
From right to left and left to right.
Why do I like to hop, hop, hop?
I do not know. Go ask your Pop.

Brush, brush, brush, brush
Comb, comb, comb, comb
Blue hair is fun to brush and comb.
All girls who like to brush and comb,
Should have a pet like this at home.

Who is this pet? Say! He is wet.
You never yet met a pet, I bet,
As wet as they let this wet pet get.

Did you ever fly a kite in bed?
did you ever walk with ten cats on your head?
Did you ever milk this kind of cow?
Well, we can do it. We know how.
If you never did, you should.
These things are fun, and fun is good.

Hello, hello. Are you there?
Hello! I called you up to say hello.
I said Hello.
Can you hear me, Joe?
Oh no, I cannot hear your call.
I cannot hear your call at all.
This is not good, and I know why.
A mouse has cut the wire, goodbye!

From near to far, from here to there,
Funny things are everywhere.
These yellow pets are called the Zeds.
They have one hair upon their heads.
Their hair grows fast. So fast they say,
They need a haircut every day.

Who am I? My name is Ish
On my hand I have a dish.
I have this dish to help me wish.
When I wish to make a wish
I wave my hand with a big swish swish.
Then I say, ""I wish for fish!""
And I get fish right on my dish.
So...
If you wish to make a wish,
you may swish for fish with my Ish wish dish.

At our house we play out back.
We play a game called ring the Gack.
Would you like to play this game?
Come down! We have the only Gack in town.

Look what we found in the park in the dark.
We will take him home, we will call him Clark.
He will live at our house, he will grow and grow.
Will our mother like this? We don't know.

And now, Good night.
It is time to sleep
So we will sleep with our pet Zeep.
Today is gone. Today was fun.
Tomorrow is another one.
Every day, from here to there.

This book/poem does not contain a single narrative or plotline. The speaker changes and the imagery is always outrageous and enjoyable. The story loosely focuses on two young children, Jay and Kay, and the worlds they are being introduced to. There are strange sights to see, characters to meet, fish to judge, games to play, and words to say. The best part comes at the end when the children are informed they can do it all again the next day."

hateful to them

Merwin depicts the memorable events of John Keats' life alongside the felling of Sandalwood trees in Hawaii after the British colonization. In music, a chord means a group of notes sounds together harmoniously. The title of the poem describes the harmony in creation and destruction. This kind of amalgamation creates rather an unpleasant note of human history. Throughout this piece, Merwin alludes to a number of Keatsian poems and juxtaposes the main ideas with the gradual destruction of the Sandalwood forest in Hawaii. Lastly, the poet notes how one can decode this intricate language of human action."

These apples were a gift that Gaea, or Earth, gave to the goddess Hera at her marriage to Zeus. Traditionally, there are three Hesperides, Aegle, Erytheia, and Hespere. In different tellings of various stories, these women were said to have been born from Atlas and Hesperis, or Erebus and Night. The women guard the apples alongside a dragon, Ladon. The golden apples of the Hesperides are featured in a number of stories, especially in accounts of Heracles', ( Hercules) 11th labor."

Sits in yon western tent, whose cloudy skirts,
With brede ethereal wove,

Thy genial loved return.

His paly circlet, at his warning lamp

Who slept in flowers the day,
And many a nymph who wreathes her brows with sedge
And sheds the fresh'ning dew, and lovelier still,

Cheers the lone heath, or some time-hallowed pile

Reflect its last cool gleam.

Thy dewy fingers draw
The gradual dusky veil.

And bathe thy breathing tresses, meekest Eve;
While Summer loves to sport
Beneath thy ling'ring light;
While sallow Autumn fills thy lap with leaves;
Or Winter, yelling through the troublous air,
Affrights thy shrinking train
And rudely rends thy robes;

The speaker of this piece who represents Collins' poetic voice, converses directly with “Eve” or evening to please her. At first, by describing the sky, he details how the day is about to end and the night is approaching. The creatures like a bat and beetle give the readers an auditory effect. By painting the ambiance, he tries to depict the calmness of nature in the evening. In the end, Collins presents the effect of seasons on her (Eve)."

she thinks, a map laid down to memorize
because she might be walking it, it shows
ridge upon ridge fading into hazed desert
here and there a sign of aquifers
and one possible watering-hole. If this were a map
it would be the map of the last age of her life,
not a map of choices but a map of variations

The poem begins with the speaker describing the seemingly mundane details of her typing desk. It is an extremely functional item but it also contains all the markings of a landscape-like map. This is a feature that only someone with an artistic inclination, or a child, could see. The speaker continues to describe how this map is one that describes her life. It shows the ups and downs and progress towards one particular way of being. The poem concludes with the speaker relating the material nature of the table to the dream-like qualities of thought and poetry.

'Full Moon and Little Frieda' effectively uses natural imagery and descriptive language to set the tone and atmosphere for the poem. The first stanza introduces several animals and household objects, evoking a sense of familiarity. Hughes uses metaphors to compare everyday occurrences to Frieda's strength, as well as give insight into the family history. The second stanza has an ominous atmosphere, wherein Hughes effectively uses contrasting colors and imagery to create suspense and tension. In the last lines of the stanza, Frieda seems to pull Hughes out of deep thought by repeatedly exclaiming 'moon.' Hughes admires his daughter's simple and raw outlook on the world. The final stanza collocates Hughes' amazement with Frieda's uncomplicated worldview with his ability to create a person that, while being fragile and small in stature, is incredibly resilient."

And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.
He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;
And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.

The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow—
Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;
For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,
And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.

877,888,888,"Once upon a time, in a busy shop

In the land of tribes and ancient civilizations

A little girl sat watching…

in silent resignation

Grown-up women with shrouds of black

Hidden and silent… in isolation

With a “no-trespassing” look

They wandered around in simulation

When a single woman appeared, suddenly, in the shop

The little girl felt a sudden sensation

Yes, the woman wore the black alright…

 

Yet, she walked with determination

Not cautious, fearful, or covered-up

The woman moved as a distinct population

She seemed to own the world

 

She was … such an inspiration…

Why would she be on her own? The little girl wondered?

Wasn’t she afraid from reprimands or accusations?

Looking that pretty in embroidered black,

Defying the norms as if in a celebration

Who gave her the money that she’s spending

Without a second thought or a hesitation?

Was she really confident and strong as she seemed?

Or is it the little girl’s wishful imagination????

 

In that little girl’s life

Most women shared a specific combination

Emotions were not revealed, opinions were suppressed

With lots of reservations

They held on to their black tightly

Least someone recognize their identifications

Their world seemed full of judging men

Watching for proofs of condemnation

So the women in black kept their covers tight

Protecting their reputation

 

Yet a single woman in black dared to show her face

Visible without a mask, in obvious relaxation!!

The little girl knew that something/ someone

Must explain that awkward observation

Of that visible woman in black

 

Despite the isolation… despite the limitations

As time passes-by,

The little girl grows in fascination

More visible women are out there

Raising their voices in frustration

They no longer accept second-places

They no-longer sat in resignation

The reality doors are shut but the virtual ones are forcedly-opened

With fierce determination

The women in black want their rights

Demanding full participation

Campaigning for municipal elections, driving,

Minimum marital age or right of self- representation

Commenting on international treaties for women,

Gender-equality, or women-rights affiliation

They are loud and visible

No longer silent, passive, or fearing condemnation

They write, blog, tweet, and post

In a constant flow of information

They build networks and constituencies

Unlimited by gender-segregation,

No longer helpless or maintained

As prisoners of infinite duration…

 

Yes, we are in a constant fear of social backlash

But the power of words defeats organizations

The little girl recalls the single woman in black…

Whenever she feels a hesitation…

Beautiful and powerful in her own way…

A woman, who defeats stagnation…

We will not be deprived

We are a different generation….

And if countries can be flipped over and start anew

In search of liberation

We, too, the women in black

Can exceed our own expectations",A little girl sat watching... in silent resignation Grown-up women with shrou,"The Women in Black' by Hala al-Dosari is a powerful poem about the equal rights movement in Saudi Arabia.

This woman multiplies until it seems that the whole country has risen up in demand of equal treatment for men and women."

I buried him in the garden
next to a rusted old machine.

Some day I'll join him right there,
but now he's gone with his shaggy coat,
his bad manners and his cold nose,
and I, the materialist, who never believed
in any promised heaven in the sky
for any human being,
I believe in a heaven I'll never enter.
Yes, I believe in a heaven for all dogdom
where my dog waits for my arrival
waving his fan-like tail in friendship.

Ai, I'll not speak of sadness here on earth,
of having lost a companion
who was never servile.
His friendship for me, like that of a porcupine
withholding its authority,
was the friendship of a star, aloof,
with no more intimacy than was called for,
with no exaggerations:
he never climbed all over my clothes
filling me full of his hair or his mange,
he never rubbed up against my knee
like other dogs obsessed with sex.

No, my dog used to gaze at me,
paying me the attention I need,
the attention required
to make a vain person like me understand
that, being a dog, he was wasting time,
but, with those eyes so much purer than mine,
he'd keep on gazing at me
with a look that reserved for me alone
all his sweet and shaggy life,
always near me, never troubling me,
and asking nothing.

Ai, how many times have I envied his tail
as we walked together on the shores of the sea
in the lonely winter of Isla Negra
where the wintering birds filled the sky
and my hairy dog was jumping about
full of the voltage of the sea's movement:
my wandering dog, sniffing away
with his golden tail held high,
face to face with the ocean's spray.

Joyful, joyful, joyful,
as only dogs know how to be happy
with only the autonomy
of their shameless spirit.

There are no good-byes for my dog who has died,
and we don't now and never did lie to each other.

and that's all there is to it.",I believe in a heaven for all dogdom where my dog waits for my arrival w,"'A Dog Has Died' by Pablo Neruda is a moving elegy written after the death of the poet's reserved and yet joyful dog. Throughout the poem, the poet takes the reader through the different aspects of his dog's personality. He was not over-affectionate or overbearing. The dog did as he liked when he wanted to. He gave Neruda just enough attention for them to understand one another. Neruda spends the last stanzas of the poem discussing the joy his dog took in everything. He had the capacity to celebrate his life that humans don't have."

While hammers fell like ringing bells
In places deep, where dark things sleep,
In hollow halls beneath the fells.

There many a gleaming golden hoard

To hide in gems on hilt of sword.

They meshed the light of moon and sun.

To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away, ere break of day,
To claim our long-forgotten gold.

Goblets they carved there for themselves
And harps of gold; where no man delves
There lay they long, and many a song
Was sung unheard by men or elves.

The pines were roaring on the height,
The winds were moaning in the night.
The fire was red, it flaming spread;
The trees like torches blazed with light.

The bells were ringing in the dale
And men looked up with faces pale;
Then dragon’s ire more fierce than fire
Laid low their towers and houses frail.

The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.
They fled their hall, to dying fall
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.

These were laboured over by Thorin's ancestors and he, as the rightful king under the mountain, wants to win it back.

One day they will avenge the misdoings and stand up for their rights. Enough blood will be spilled to quench their anger. Thereafter, the poet describes the condition of a slave chained inside a chamber. He thinks of his past when he was free. However, at some point in time, he was taken into this trade. For this reason, he gets angry whenever he thinks of freedom. This anger leads to the dark desire of killing his lord. In this way, Southey anticipates the future of the slave trade."

With America's expansion into California, many came to the realization that it was the farthest the country could expand in the west.

The poet describes the tree as it looked “yesterday” when the dawn arose. This suggests, right from the beginning, that perhaps things are different now than they were then. Either way, she notes how the wind moved through the tree's “hair” and the dawn illuminated the snow on its leaves. The flakes shined, as if diamonds, reflecting the light of the sun. All the other natural elements, the wind, and sun are struck by the beauty of the tree at that moment. Its beauty, unlike theirs, is more fleeting. It will not look exactly this way again. In fact, it could disappear at any moment."

In that image, one can visualize a man/ woman on top of another and having sex. But, the addition of the word “failure” shows the emotional world of both the man and the woman. There is some sort of absence that is troubling both of them. Hence, it seems that they are in a mechanical process of love-making and somehow trying to exhale their frustration."

Told of a harsh reproof, or trivial event
That changed some childish day to tragedy—
Told, and it seemed that our two natures blent
Into a sphere from youthful sympathy,
Or else, to alter Plato's parable,
Into the yolk and white of the one shell.



And thinking of that fit of grief or rage
I look upon one child or t'other there
And wonder if she stood so at that age—
For even daughters of the swan can share
Something of every paddler's heritage—
And had that colour upon cheek or hair,
And thereupon my heart is driven wild:
She stands before me as a living child.



Her present image floats into the mind—
Did Quattrocento finger fashion it
Hollow of cheek as though it drank the wind
And took a mess of shadows for its meat?
And I though never of Ledaean kind
Had pretty plumage once—enough of that,
Better to smile on all that smile, and show
There is a comfortable kind of old scarecrow.



What youthful mother, a shape upon her lap
Honey of generation had betrayed,
And that must sleep, shriek, struggle to escape
As recollection or the drug decide,
Would think her son, did she but see that shape
With sixty or more winters on its head,
A compensation for the pang of his birth,
Or the uncertainty of his setting forth?



Plato thought nature but a spume that plays
Upon a ghostly paradigm of things;
Solider Aristotle played the taws
Upon the bottom of a king of kings;
World-famous golden-thighed Pythagoras
Fingered upon a fiddle-stick or strings
What a star sang and careless Muses heard:
Old clothes upon old sticks to scare a bird.



Both nuns and mothers worship images,
But those the candles light are not as those
That animate a mother's reveries,
But keep a marble or a bronze repose.
And yet they too break hearts—O Presences
That passion, piety or affection knows,
And that all heavenly glory symbolise—
O self-born mockers of man's enterprise;




Labour is blossoming or dancing where
The body is not bruised to pleasure soul,
Nor beauty born out of its own despair,
Nor blear-eyed wisdom out of midnight oil.
O chestnut tree, great rooted blossomer,
Are you the leaf, the blossom or the bole?
O body swayed to music, O brightening glance,
How can we know the dancer from the dance?",A kind old nun in a white hood replies; The children learn to cipher,"As the elderly speaker of “Among School Children” contemplates life, he begins to understand that there is beauty in life’s process: in the ongoing “blossoming” of the here and now. Life isn’t some static product, in other words, but rather a kind of continual movement from one moment to the next. Change (including the change entailed by growing older) is inseparable from life itself."

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins by saying that he has been proven right in regard to how long he'd get to stay with the Fair Youth. Those who made false predictions are now laughing at themselves for suggesting that anything else could've happened. There was a time when things were uncertain, and the speaker didn't know for sure what was going to happen, but now he does. He knows that peace is here to stay and that due to this poem he's written, he and his true love are going to outsmart death. It will serve as their monument."

The poem begins with the speaker describing a servant, referred to as “Betty” leaving her masters bed and returning to her own room. It is the early morning and the residents of the city are just starting their day. After “Betty,” Swift moves on to speak about cleaners and the different ways they work. These characters are followed by bill-collectors, thieves, a chimney-sweep, and a brickdust seller. All manner of the profession is mentioned by the speaker, emphasizing the wide-ranging types of existence in Swift's own time."

The poem begins with the narrator clearly stating that even if there is chaos in the world, his own “little world” is where he focuses. His “thinking lies” there. Within this world he has created, he has a paradise where all of his dreams are realized. The speaker continues to describe how he lives within a shell and can escape there, like a turtle or hermit crab, when he is in danger. Even if regimes rose, fell, and rose again, he would not notice. Nothing phases him or takes away from his peace. Additionally, he states that even if deities singled him out, haunting him in the night, he would just close his eyes and go back into his mind. The poem concludes with the speaker once more reiterating that none of the things previously mentioned can harm him, and comparing himself to a snow-flake that is unmoved and unafraid of the “whirlwind” around him.

And reign the lord of earth.

When Sin was quite unknown,
And all the woes it brought,
He hailed the morn without a groan
Or one corroding thought.

When each revolving wheel
Assumed its sphere sublime,
Submissive Earth then heard the peal,
And struck the march of time.

With joy from chaos rise.

There are lots of biblical references in particular to the fall of man. It begins by exulting god and praising the effects of creation. Though splattered throughout are warning flags about the fate of our planet. Around the tenth stanza, the mood of the poem changes and I think this represents the fall of man. This could be a euphemism for slavery, however. The final stanza acts almost as a mirror image to the first stanza which gives the poem symmetry."

The poem begins with the speaker making five statements regarding how the “world” will react depending on whether you “Laugh” or “Weep.” Someone who is happy and upbeat is going to attract friends while someone who “Sigh[s]” and weeps will not. Through the next two stanza, the speaker tries to make clear that one should do whatever possible to maintain a happy life surrounded by those who increase that happiness. Sadness will breed nothing but solitude. The poem concludes with the speaker adding that pain and death happen to everyone, but they will always be faced alone."
890,901,901,"The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees,
The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,
The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,
And the highwayman came riding—
Riding—riding—
The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.

He'd a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,
A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin;
They fitted with never a wrinkle: his boots were up to the thigh!
And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,
His pistol butts a-twinkle,
His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.

Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard,
And he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred;
He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there
But the landlord's black-eyed daughter,
Bess, the landlord's daughter,
Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.

And dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked
Where Tim the ostler listened; his face was white and peaked;
His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay,
But he loved the landlord's daughter,
The landlord's red-lipped daughter,
Dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say

""One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I'm after a prize to-night,
But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light;
Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,
Then look for me by moonlight,
Watch for me by moonlight,
I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.""

He rose upright in the stirrups; he scarce could reach her hand,
But she loosened her hair i' the casement! His face burnt like a brand
As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;
And he kissed its waves in the moonlight,
(Oh, sweet black waves in the moonlight!)
Then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the West.



He did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon;
And out o' the tawny sunset, before the rise o' the moon,
When the road was a gipsy's ribbon, looping the purple moor,
A red-coat troop came marching—
Marching—marching—
King George's men came marching, up to the old inn-door.

They said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead,
But they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed;
Two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side!
There was death at every window;
And hell at one dark window;
For Bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would ride.

They had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest;
They had bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast!
""Now keep good watch!"" and they kissed her.
She heard the dead man say—
Look for me by moonlight;
Watch for me by moonlight;
I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!

She twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good!
She writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood!
They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years,
Till, now, on the stroke of midnight,
Cold, on the stroke of midnight,
The tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers!

The tip of one finger touched it; she strove no more for the rest!
Up, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast,
She would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again;
For the road lay bare in the moonlight;
Blank and bare in the moonlight;
And the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love's refrain.

Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse-hoofs ringing clear;
Tlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, in the distance? Were they deaf that they did not hear?
Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill,
The highwayman came riding,
Riding, riding!
The red-coats looked to their priming! She stood up, straight and still!

Tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot, in the echoing night!
Nearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light!
Her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,
Then her finger moved in the moonlight,
Her musket shattered the moonlight,
Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him—with her death.

He turned; he spurred to the West; he did not know who stood
Bowed, with her head o'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood!
Not till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear
How Bess, the landlord's daughter,
The landlord's black-eyed daughter,
Had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.

Back, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky,
With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high!
Blood-red were his spurs i' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat,
When they shot him down on the highway,
Down like a dog on the highway,
And he lay in his blood on the highway, with the bunch of lace at his throat.

And still of a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the trees,
When the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,
When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,
A highwayman comes riding—
Riding—riding—

The poem details the love affair going on between the highwayman and the landlord's daughter Bess. Their love is pure and strong. He rides into the inn in the middle of the night to tell her that he's going robbing and will come back the next day no matter what. Unfortunately for both of them, in the meantime soldiers come and set a trap for him. Bess is able to escape from where they tied her up and in an act of desperation, she kills herself as he rides up the road. The shot warns him that something is wrong and he runs. But, when he finds out what has happened he returns, is shot dead, and then reunited with Bess in the afterlife."

They feel as though they died and are “alive again today” and can feel the beauty of “life,” “love,” “wings,” and “of the gay / great happening illimitably earth.” The speaker concludes the poem by acknowledging that some human beings doubt God's existence.

Alongside this, he argues that everyone deserves comfort and happiness. From these two statements, it can be assumed that McGrath believes everyone should find love and joy. It is better to actually take action, rather than just thinking about doing something. The poet moves through the slumbering building in his mind, taking stock of all the people sleeping. He understands their individual pains, hoping to help alleviate them. McGrath knows that he would go to the ends of the earth in order to let them all sleep peacefully. The final stanza states that he should go to sleep himself, these 'fancies' not actually doing anything. He realizes that he can fantasize about helping people all he wants, the fact is he doesn't do anything and doesn't change the lives of these people."

The poem begins with the speaker telling the reader that he thinks a lot about what it's like to be a king. He goes through a number of different countries and activities he'd like to participate, or not participate, in. These include keeping wild animals, like elephants, not wearing his hat or brushing his hair, and thinking of “lovely things to do.” He shows his desire to gain some control over his life and those around him. The child speaker feels as if the rules imposed on him are unfair and would like to get rid of them. The funny, yet poignant, desires of the speaker are widely relatable to any child reading the text, making this piece a great example of children's poetry."

The poem takes the reader through a speaker's opinion of “Winter”. Clare uses personification to speak more clearly on the power of winter to make people frown with its “grinning north-winds”. There are horrible moments in every winter season but there are also wonderful ones. The speaker says that he can't help but love winter for the moments that the clouds part and a sunbeam comes down, creating a winter rainbow. He is always enchanted by this sight, connecting back to an accumulation of witch/magic related images and language used to describe winter throughout the poem."

Else it would be lost in the great snow cover stretching beneath the lovers' feet."

Great love in me for thee and Poesy.

'Acrostic: Georgiana Augusta Keats' by John Keats is a poem describing the role of verse as an expression of a poet's true feelings towards someone. Here the poet is dedicated to the poet's sister-in-law Georgiana Augusta Keats. She was the wife of his brother George Keats. The couple assisted the ailing poet while he began a walking tour in 1818. The poet presents his thankfulness to her for staying by his side. He seeks inspiration from the Greek God of poetry, Apollo, and the nine muses to assist him to write a verse that can present his true emotions to her. In the end, the poet wishes Georgiana for a better future with his husband George. And refers to his poem as a reminder of the love that will keep the poet, John Keats alive in their happily married life."
902,913,913,"My Love is like to ice, and I to fire:
How comes it then that this her cold so great
Is not dissolved through my so hot desire,
But harder grows the more I her entreat?
Or how comes it that my exceeding heat
Is not allayed by her heart-frozen cold,
But that I burn much more in boiling sweat,
And feel my flames augmented manifold?
What more miraculous thing may be told,
That fire, which all things melts, should harden ice,
And ice, which is congeal’d with senseless cold,
Should kindle fire by wonderful device?
Such is the power of love in gentle mind,
That it can alter all the course of kind.","My Love is like to ice, and I to fire: How comes it then that this","My Love is like to ice, and I to fire' by Edmund Spenser describes the contradictory but also complementary personalities of the speaker and his lover. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is like fire and his lover is like ice. Although they are different from one another their love is strong. It becomes clear as the poem progresses that it is due to their differences that their love succeeds. The first three sets of four lines contain questions the speaker, Spenser himself, poses to the reader. These are not meant to be answered. Instead, they are included to emphasize the “miraculous” nature of the relationship. The woman's ice is not melted by his fire, nor is his fire “allayed” by her cold. The poem concludes with a couplet that answers all of the speaker's questions. It is love that has given their relationship the power it needs to succeed. Love has the ability to overcome all types and kinds."
903,914,914,"If the meaning of the prayer was not passed down to you,
find it through holier means than translation.
Cling to the rhythm instead.
If you were not taught the rhythm, memorize the clang
of knife against yam against wooden cutting board.
Keep it ringing, ringing in your ears.
If not the ring,
then the Bombay jazz club
and its green lanterns swaying in the long, long night
If you were not given the religion, then at least
Boompa’s rosary beads,
with their memories
indented in thick amber,
the gold Zarathustra hanging from a neck
and tattooed on a sunburnt back.
If the traditions were never taught to you,
then cling to tea time always served at 2pm.
Display the cups and remember
elders do not take their tea with sugar,
like you do.
You have only a fraction of their blood.
You thicken your water with milk.

then the sprigs of lemongrass from the garden will do.
The tea bags brought from India will do.
The reusable garland will do.

The fourth will do, too.
With its back facing you,
and its open jaws the homeland.
If the orthodox genealogy did not show up to the altar
of any of the son’s weddings, identity will celebrate
the melting pot mothers. Inheritance
blooms a grateful garland
around the brownish baby’s plump smile.
Her laughter, an anthem.
Her heartbeat, a golden rhythm.",The ring of the prayer is a reminder of the sacrificial lamb.,"The poem is titled 'The Diaspora', which means dispersion, particularly, of the Jews after the Babylonian captivity. It also refers to the dispersion of the Jews in the Age of Christ's Twelve Apostles. In relation to the present poem, the title also means the dispersion of the Jews and their emigration to other countries, from Germany and the countries occupied by her during World War II (1939-45). In a gloomy mood, Auden writes that the Jews have never reconciled themselves to the survival of Christianity after Christ's crucifixion. They persecuted him like anything. They pursued him to the cross. Thereafter they vilified his system of religion and ridiculed his Heaven as a land of mirages. Their sin has ultimately recoiled upon themselves. The Nazi Germans are persecuting the Jews as if to punish them for the sin committed by their ancient ancestors about two thousand years ago. The Jews of the early Christian centuries could never understand how Jesus Christ and his system of religion could survive his persecution and crucifixion. Their ancestors had beggared him, pursued him to the Cross, and had him crucified. Their intolerance proved that they loved their God called Jehovah, their Jewish religion, and their land Israel more than their lives. Their God had commanded them to love and worship only it, with all their heart and in all places. Hence they attempted to drive Christ and his faith not only out of the bounds of the earth but also out of the bounds of their heaven. Yet Christ completed his mission of the prophet for which he was born. But his persecutors were filled with envy at his religion of the Cross, too. They vilified his system of religion to the last degree. They represented his Heaven as a land of mirages. And now in the present age, their sin of persecuting Christ has again recoiled upon the heads of their children. The Nazi Germans are persecuting the human body of the Jews, and causing the diaspora as if to punish them for the sin of Christ's persecution committed by their ancient ancestors about two thousand years ago. In the present sonnet, Auden has employed 'he,' 'his,' and 'him' for Jesus Christ, and 'they,' 'them,' and 'their' for the Jews. In the last line, 'they' has been used to refer to the Nazi German. Auden has adopted this device to avoid falling into any religious controversy."
904,915,915,"I SAID—Then, dearest, since 'tis so,
Since now at length my fate I know,
Since nothing all my love avails,
Since all, my life seem'd meant for, fails,
Since this was written and needs must be—
My whole heart rises up to bless
Your name in pride and thankfulness!
Take back the hope you gave,—I claim
Only a memory of the same,
—And this beside, if you will not blame;
Your leave for one more last ride with me.
My mistress bent that brow of hers,
Those deep dark eyes where pride demurs
When pity would be softening through,
Fix'd me a breathing-while or two
With life or death in the balance: right!
The blood replenish'd me again;
My last thought was at least not vain:
I and my mistress, side by side
Shall be together, breathe and ride,
So, one day more am I deified.
Who knows but the world may end to-night?
Hush! if you saw some western cloud
All billowy-bosom'd, over-bow'd
By many benedictions—sun's
And moon's and evening-star's at once—
And so, you, looking and loving best,
Conscious grew, your passion drew
Cloud, sunset, moonrise, star-shine too,
Down on you, near and yet more near,
Till flesh must fade for heaven was here!—
Thus leant she and linger'd—joy and fear!
Thus lay she a moment on my breast.
Then we began to ride. My soul
Smooth'd itself out, a long-cramp'd scroll
Freshening and fluttering in the wind.
Past hopes already lay behind.
What need to strive with a life awry?
Had I said that, had I done this,
So might I gain, so might I miss.
Might she have loved me? just as well
She might have hated, who can tell!
Where had I been now if the worst befell?
And here we are riding, she and I.
Fail I alone, in words and deeds?
Why, all men strive and who succeeds?
We rode; it seem'd my spirit flew,
Saw other regions, cities new,
As the world rush'd by on either side.
I thought,—All labour, yet no less
Bear up beneath their unsuccess.
Look at the end of work, contrast
The petty done, the undone vast,
This present of theirs with the hopeful past!
I hoped she would love me; here we ride.
What hand and brain went ever pair'd?
What heart alike conceived and dared?
What act proved all its thought had been?
What will but felt the fleshly screen?
We ride and I see her bosom heave.
There 's many a crown for who can reach.
Ten lines, a statesman's life in each!
The flag stuck on a heap of bones,
A soldier's doing! what atones?
They scratch his name on the Abbey-stones.
My riding is better, by their leave.
What does it all mean, poet? Well,
Your brains beat into rhythm, you tell
What we felt only; you express'd
You hold things beautiful the best,
And pace them in rhyme so, side by side.
'Tis something, nay 'tis much: but then,
Have you yourself what 's best for men?
Are you—poor, sick, old ere your time—
Nearer one whit your own sublime
Than we who never have turn'd a rhyme?
Sing, riding 's a joy! For me, I ride.
And you, great sculptor—so, you gave
A score of years to Art, her slave,
And that 's your Venus, whence we turn
To yonder girl that fords the burn!
You acquiesce, and shall I repine?
What, man of music, you grown gray
With notes and nothing else to say,
Is this your sole praise from a friend,
'Greatly his opera's strains intend,
But in music we know how fashions end!'
I gave my youth: but we ride, in fine.
Who knows what 's fit for us? Had fate
Proposed bliss here should sublimate
My being—had I sign'd the bond—
Still one must lead some life beyond,
Have a bliss to die with, dim-descried.
This foot once planted on the goal,
This glory-garland round my soul,
Could I descry such? Try and test!
I sink back shuddering from the quest.
Earth being so good, would heaven seem best?
Now, heaven and she are beyond this ride.
And yet—she has not spoke so long!
What if heaven be that, fair and strong
At life's best, with our eyes upturn'd
Whither life's flower is first discern'd,
We, fix'd so, ever should so abide?
What if we still ride on, we two
With life for ever old yet new,
Changed not in kind but in degree,
The instant made eternity,—
And heaven just prove that I and she
Ride, ride together, for ever ride?","I SAID—Then, dearest, since 'tis so, Since now","The Last Ride Together' by Robert Browning revolves around the last encounter of two lovers and how that “last ride” becomes a memorable moment of a lifetime for the speaker. In this dramatic monologue, the speaker, first of all, presents a background of the story. The speaker is taking leave from his beloved. Before parting, he just requests his beloved to go on a ride with him for the last time. The lady accepts the invitation. It seems that she is also interested in passing a few more moments with the person for whom her hearts leaped up in joy at once. Being the last chapter of their journey, both the speaker and the lady want to make that moment precious. However, throughout the poem, she doesn't speak a word. Only the speaker muses on his feelings only and presents several comparisons to prove the fact that they are, in fact, in a better position. Their love is momentary but sublime. They won't be meeting in near future yet they can look back to this episode forever and ever."
905,916,916,"It is in the small things we see it.
The child's first step,
as awesome as an earthquake.
The first time you rode a bike,
wallowing up the sidewalk.
The first spanking when your heart
went on a journey all alone.
When they called you crybaby
or poor or fatty or crazy
and made you into an alien,
you drank their acid
and concealed it.

Later,
if you faced the death of bombs and bullets
you did not do it with a banner,
you did it with only a hat to
comver your heart.
You did not fondle the weakness inside you
though it was there.
Your courage was a small coal
that you kept swallowing.
If your buddy saved you
and died himself in so doing,
then his courage was not courage,
it was love; love as simple as shaving soap.

Later,
if you have endured a great despair,
then you did it alone,
getting a transfusion from the fire,
picking the scabs off your heart,
then wringing it out like a sock.
Next, my kinsman, you powdered your sorrow,
you gave it a back rub
and then you covered it with a blanket
and after it had slept a while
it woke to the wings of the roses
and was transformed.

Later,
when you face old age and its natural conclusion
your courage will still be shown in the little ways,
each spring will be a sword you'll sharpen,
those you love will live in a fever of love,
and you'll bargain with the calendar
and at the last moment
when death opens the back door
you'll put on your carpet slippers
and stride out.","The little things we see it. The child's first step, as awesome as an earthquake","The poem, Courage, is divided into four stanzas, with each stanza representing a different stage in one's life. For instance, the first stanza discusses childhood; the second stanza describes the scenes from young adulthood; the third stanza contends with middle age; the final stanza discusses old age. The speaker of the poem gives examples of instances in each life stage where a person may have to show courage. Through her use of imagery, Sexton paints a rich picture for her reader."

Aglow and warm and gay,

Sat where the hearth-fire burned.
There was no lightest echo lost
When I undid the door,
There was no shadow where I crossed
The well-remembered floor.

He slept no lighter nor more sound,
He did not lift his head.
I brushed my father as I came;
He did not move or see—
I cried upon my mother’s name;
She did not look at me.
Their faces in the firelight bent,
They smiled in speaking slow
Of some old gracious merriment
Forgotten years ago.
I was so changed since they had died!
How could they know or guess
A voice that plead for love, and cried
Of grief and loneliness?

The poem begins with the speaker stating that she is entering the “House of Ghosts.” This place is well-known to her, and is later revealed to be her childhood home. Upon entering the house she sees her “hound” on the floor. She bends to speak with him and he does not raise his head or make a sound. She realizes that he is dead. The next person she comes across is her father. The speaker touches him, but he doesn't react. It has been so long since she was home that he does not recognize, or even hear her voice. Finally, she calls out for her mother but she does not turn her head. In the final lines the speaker flees from the house, her worst fears confirmed. She has been gone so long, and changed so much, that no one knows her."

There!"" But instead of following my outstretched
arm to the crown of the tree, where the animal is
now lounging under a canopy of leaves,

catching its breath, charting its next escape,

The poem begins by speaking about the use of personification in poetry. It is something that other poets don't like but the speaker enjoys it. She shows off some interesting examples of it, including one about her dog practicing geometry. This leads to a discussion of her dog's attempts to catch a squirrel."

The poem begins with the speaker telling the listener of his crime. He ate “the plums,” a very specific group of them, from the fridge. These fruits were important to the listener because they were going to have them for breakfast. This is a fact the speaker was aware of but chose to disregard. When he saw them and thought about what they'd taste like, he couldn't resist. The final lines contain his apology to his listener for his actions and the reasoning behind this little betrayal."

It is not wit, or powder on the face,

Not Sara Crewe or movie magazine,
Or pennants on the walls.

Could not, would fortune grant it, name its wish;
Wants nothing, everything;
Has secrets from itself, friends it despises;
Admits none of the terrors it feels;
Owns half a hundred masks but no disguises;
And walks upon its heels.

Not folded bud, or wave that laps a shore,

In it, the speaker spends the lines having a discussion with someone, perhaps themselves, about their past and the people who were a part of it. They say that people are “bodies” dotting their past. By using “bodies,” they're distancing themselves from these people while also suggesting something about the nature of their relationship. They are told to “let go” of them, but the speaker wants them to remain, as stone, creating the “marble forest” referenced in the title."

Where sportive ladies leave their doors ajar?

Do,—harry out, if you must show your zeal,
Whatever rat, there, haps on his wrong hole,
And nip each softling of a wee white mouse,
Weke, weke, that's crept to keep him company!
Aha, you know your betters! Then, you'll take
Your hand away that's fiddling on my throat,
And please to know me likewise. Who am I?
Why, one, sir, who is lodging with a friend
Three streets off—he's a certain . . . how d'ye call?
Master—a ...Cosimo of the Medici,
I' the house that caps the corner. Boh! you were best!
Remember and tell me, the day you're hanged,
How you affected such a gullet's-gripe!
But you, sir, it concerns you that your knaves
Pick up a manner nor discredit you:
Zooks, are we pilchards, that they sweep the streets
And count fair price what comes into their net?
He's Judas to a tittle, that man is!
Just such a face! Why, sir, you make amends.

With the pike and lantern,—for the slave that holds
John Baptist's head a-dangle by the hair
With one hand (""Look you, now,"" as who should say)
And his weapon in the other, yet unwiped!

A sweep of lute strings, laughs, and whifts of song, —

Take away love, and our earth is a tomb!
Flower o' the quince,

And a face that looked up . . . zooks, sir, flesh and blood,

Curtain and counterpane and coverlet,
All the bed-furniture—a dozen knots,
There was a ladder! Down I let myself,

And after them. I came up with the fun

To get to bed and have a bit of sleep

With his great round stone to subdue the flesh,
You snap me of the sudden. Ah, I see!
Though your eye twinkles still, you shake your head—

And father died and left me in the street.

My stomach being empty as your hat,
The wind doubled me up and down I went.
Old Aunt Lapaccia trussed me with one hand,
(Its fellow was a stinger as I knew)
And so along the wall, over the bridge,
By the straight cut to the convent. Six words there,
While I stood munching my first bread that month:
""So, boy, you're minded,"" quoth the good fat father
Wiping his own mouth, 'twas refection-time,—
""To quit this very miserable world?
Will you renounce"" . . . ""the mouthful of bread?"" thought I;
By no means! Brief, they made a monk of me;
I did renounce the world, its pride and greed,
Palace, farm, villa, shop, and banking-house,
Trash, such as these poor devils of Medici
Have given their hearts to—all at eight years old.
Well, sir, I found in time, you may be sure,
'Twas not for nothing—the good bellyful,
The warm serge and the rope that goes all round,
And day-long blessed idleness beside!
""Let's see what the urchin's fit for""—that came next.
Not overmuch their way, I must confess.
Such a to-do! They tried me with their books:
Lord, they'd have taught me Latin in pure waste!
Flower o' the clove.
All the Latin I construe is, ""amo"" I love!
But, mind you, when a boy starves in the streets
Eight years together, as my fortune was,
Watching folk's faces to know who will fling
The bit of half-stripped grape-bunch he desires,
And who will curse or kick him for his pains,—
Which gentleman processional and fine,
Holding a candle to the Sacrament,
Will wink and let him lift a plate and catch
The droppings of the wax to sell again,
Or holla for the Eight and have him whipped,—
How say I?—nay, which dog bites, which lets drop
His bone from the heap of offal in the street,—
Why, soul and sense of him grow sharp alike,
He learns the look of things, and none the less
For admonition from the hunger-pinch.
I had a store of such remarks, be sure,
Which, after I found leisure, turned to use.
I drew men's faces on my copy-books,
Scrawled them within the antiphonary's marge,
Joined legs and arms to the long music-notes,
Found eyes and nose and chin for A's and B's,
And made a string of pictures of the world
Betwixt the ins and outs of verb and noun,
On the wall, the bench, the door. The monks looked black.
""Nay,"" quoth the Prior, ""turn him out, d'ye say?
In no wise. Lose a crow and catch a lark.
What if at last we get our man of parts,
We Carmelites, like those Camaldolese
And Preaching Friars, to do our church up fine
And put the front on it that ought to be!""
And hereupon he bade me daub away.
Thank you! my head being crammed, the walls a blank,
Never was such prompt disemburdening.
First, every sort of monk, the black and white,
I drew them, fat and lean: then, folk at church,
From good old gossips waiting to confess
Their cribs of barrel-droppings, candle-ends,—
To the breathless fellow at the altar-foot,
Fresh from his murder, safe and sitting there
With the little children round him in a row
Of admiration, half for his beard and half
For that white anger of his victim's son
Shaking a fist at him with one fierce arm,
Signing himself with the other because of Christ
(Whose sad face on the cross sees only this
After the passion of a thousand years)
Till some poor girl, her apron o'er her head,
(Which the intense eyes looked through) came at eve
On tiptoe, said a word, dropped in a loaf,
Her pair of earrings and a bunch of flowers
(The brute took growling), prayed, and so was gone.
I painted all, then cried ""'Tis ask and have;
Choose, for more's ready!""—laid the ladder flat,
And showed my covered bit of cloister-wall.
The monks closed in a circle and praised loud
Till checked, taught what to see and not to see,
Being simple bodies,—""That's the very man!
Look at the boy who stoops to pat the dog!
That woman's like the Prior's niece who comes
To care about his asthma: it's the life!''
But there my triumph's straw-fire flared and funked;
Their betters took their turn to see and say:
The Prior and the learned pulled a face
And stopped all that in no time. ""How? what's here?
Quite from the mark of painting, bless us all!
Faces, arms, legs, and bodies like the true
As much as pea and pea! it's devil's-game!
Your business is not to catch men with show,
With homage to the perishable clay,
But lift them over it, ignore it all,
Make them forget there's such a thing as flesh.
Your business is to paint the souls of men—
Man's soul, and it's a fire, smoke . . . no, it's not . . .
It's vapour done up like a new-born babe—
(In that shape when you die it leaves your mouth)
It's . . . well, what matters talking, it's the soul!
Give us no more of body than shows soul!
Here's Giotto, with his Saint a-praising God,
That sets us praising—why not stop with him?
Why put all thoughts of praise out of our head
With wonder at lines, colours, and what not?
Paint the soul, never mind the legs and arms!
Rub all out, try at it a second time.
Oh, that white smallish female with the breasts,
She's just my niece . . . Herodias, I would say,—
Who went and danced and got men's heads cut off!
Have it all out!"" Now, is this sense, I ask?
A fine way to paint soul, by painting body
So ill, the eye can't stop there, must go further
And can't fare worse! Thus, yellow does for white
When what you put for yellow's simply black,
And any sort of meaning looks intense
When all beside itself means and looks nought.
Why can't a painter lift each foot in turn,
Left foot and right foot, go a double step,
Make his flesh liker and his soul more like,
Both in their order? Take the prettiest face,
The Prior's niece . . . patron-saint—is it so pretty
You can't discover if it means hope, fear,
Sorrow or joy? won't beauty go with these?
Suppose I've made her eyes all right and blue,
Can't I take breath and try to add life's flash,
And then add soul and heighten them three-fold?
Or say there's beauty with no soul at all—
(I never saw it—put the case the same—)
If you get simple beauty and nought else,
You get about the best thing God invents:
That's somewhat: and you'll find the soul you have missed,
Within yourself, when you return him thanks.
""Rub all out!"" Well, well, there's my life, in short,
And so the thing has gone on ever since.
I'm grown a man no doubt, I've broken bounds:
You should not take a fellow eight years old
And make him swear to never kiss the girls.
I'm my own master, paint now as I please—
Having a friend, you see, in the Corner-house!
Lord, it's fast holding by the rings in front—
Those great rings serve more purposes than just
To plant a flag in, or tie up a horse!
And yet the old schooling sticks, the old grave eyes
Are peeping o'er my shoulder as I work,
The heads shake still—""It's art's decline, my son!
You're not of the true painters, great and old;
Brother Angelico's the man, you'll find;
Brother Lorenzo stands his single peer:
Fag on at flesh, you'll never make the third!""
Flower o' the pine,
You keep your mistr ... manners, and I'll stick to mine!
I'm not the third, then: bless us, they must know!
Don't you think they're the likeliest to know,
They with their Latin? So, I swallow my rage,
Clench my teeth, suck my lips in tight, and paint
To please them—sometimes do and sometimes don't;
For, doing most, there's pretty sure to come
A turn, some warm eve finds me at my saints—
A laugh, a cry, the business of the world—
(Flower o' the peach
Death for us all, and his own life for each!)
And my whole soul revolves, the cup runs over,
The world and life's too big to pass for a dream,
And I do these wild things in sheer despite,
And play the fooleries you catch me at,
In pure rage! The old mill-horse, out at grass
After hard years, throws up his stiff heels so,
Although the miller does not preach to him
The only good of grass is to make chaff.
What would men have? Do they like grass or no—
May they or mayn't they? all I want's the thing
Settled for ever one way. As it is,
You tell too many lies and hurt yourself:
You don't like what you only like too much,
You do like what, if given you at your word,
You find abundantly detestable.
For me, I think I speak as I was taught;
I always see the garden and God there
A-making man's wife: and, my lesson learned,
The value and significance of flesh,
I can't unlearn ten minutes afterwards.

You understand me: I'm a beast, I know.
But see, now—why, I see as certainly
As that the morning-star's about to shine,
What will hap some day. We've a youngster here
Comes to our convent, studies what I do,
Slouches and stares and lets no atom drop:
His name is Guidi—he'll not mind the monks—
They call him Hulking Tom, he lets them talk—
He picks my practice up—he'll paint apace.
I hope so—though I never live so long,
I know what's sure to follow. You be judge!
You speak no Latin more than I, belike;
However, you're my man, you've seen the world
—The beauty and the wonder and the power,
The shapes of things, their colours, lights and shades,
Changes, surprises,—and God made it all!
—For what? Do you feel thankful, ay or no,
For this fair town's face, yonder river's line,
The mountain round it and the sky above,
Much more the figures of man, woman, child,
These are the frame to? What's it all about?
To be passed over, despised? or dwelt upon,
Wondered at? oh, this last of course!—you say.
But why not do as well as say,—paint these
Just as they are, careless what comes of it?
God's works—paint any one, and count it crime
To let a truth slip. Don't object, ""His works
Are here already; nature is complete:
Suppose you reproduce her—(which you can't)
There's no advantage! you must beat her, then.""
For, don't you mark? we're made so that we love
First when we see them painted, things we have passed
Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see;
And so they are better, painted—better to us,
Which is the same thing. Art was given for that;
God uses us to help each other so,
Lending our minds out. Have you noticed, now,
Your cullion's hanging face? A bit of chalk,
And trust me but you should, though! How much more,
If I drew higher things with the same truth!
That were to take the Prior's pulpit-place,
Interpret God to all of you! Oh, oh,
It makes me mad to see what men shall do
And we in our graves! This world's no blot for us,
Nor blank; it means intensely, and means good:
To find its meaning is my meat and drink.
""Ay, but you don't so instigate to prayer!""
Strikes in the Prior: ""when your meaning's plain
It does not say to folk—remember matins,
Or, mind you fast next Friday!"" Why, for this
What need of art at all? A skull and bones,
Two bits of stick nailed crosswise, or, what's best,
A bell to chime the hour with, does as well.
I painted a Saint Laurence six months since
At Prato, splashed the fresco in fine style:
""How looks my painting, now the scaffold's down?""
I ask a brother: ""Hugely,"" he returns—
""Already not one phiz of your three slaves
Who turn the Deacon off his toasted side,
But's scratched and prodded to our heart's content,
The pious people have so eased their own
With coming to say prayers there in a rage:
We get on fast to see the bricks beneath.
Expect another job this time next year,
For pity and religion grow i' the crowd—
Your painting serves its purpose!"" Hang the fools!

—That is—you'll not mistake an idle word
Spoke in a huff by a poor monk, God wot,
Tasting the air this spicy night which turns
The unaccustomed head like Chianti wine!
Oh, the church knows! don't misreport me, now!
It's natural a poor monk out of bounds
Should have his apt word to excuse himself:
And hearken how I plot to make amends.
I have bethought me: I shall paint a piece
... There's for you! Give me six months, then go, see
Something in Sant' Ambrogio's! Bless the nuns!
They want a cast o' my office. I shall paint
God in the midst, Madonna and her babe,
Ringed by a bowery, flowery angel-brood,
Lilies and vestments and white faces, sweet
As puff on puff of grated orris-root
When ladies crowd to Church at midsummer.
And then i' the front, of course a saint or two—
Saint John' because he saves the Florentines,
Saint Ambrose, who puts down in black and white
The convent's friends and gives them a long day,
And Job, I must have him there past mistake,
The man of Uz (and Us without the z,
Painters who need his patience). Well, all these
Secured at their devotion, up shall come
Out of a corner when you least expect,
As one by a dark stair into a great light,
Music and talking, who but Lippo! I!—
Mazed, motionless, and moonstruck—I'm the man!
Back I shrink—what is this I see and hear?
I, caught up with my monk's-things by mistake,
My old serge gown and rope that goes all round,
I, in this presence, this pure company!
Where's a hole, where's a corner for escape?
Then steps a sweet angelic slip of a thing
Forward, puts out a soft palm—""Not so fast!""
—Addresses the celestial presence, ""nay—
He made you and devised you, after all,
Though he's none of you! Could Saint John there draw—
His camel-hair make up a painting brush?
We come to brother Lippo for all that,
Iste perfecit opus! So, all smile—
I shuffle sideways with my blushing face
Under the cover of a hundred wings
Thrown like a spread of kirtles when you're gay
And play hot cockles, all the doors being shut,
Till, wholly unexpected, in there pops
The hothead husband! Thus I scuttle off
To some safe bench behind, not letting go
The palm of her, the little lily thing
That spoke the good word for me in the nick,
Like the Prior's niece . . . Saint Lucy, I would say.
And so all's saved for me, and for the church
A pretty picture gained. Go, six months hence!
Your hand, sir, and good-bye: no lights, no lights!
The street's hushed, and I know my own way back,
Don't fear me! There's the grey beginning. Zooks!","I am a monk, and I'm a painter, and I'","'Fra Lippo Lippi' by Robert Browning details the difficult, tumultuous, and sometimes scandalous life of the painter Fra Lippo Lippi. The poem begins with the painter being accosted by a number of policemen. He claims to be on his way home and not, as they think, stopping to visit a brothel. He mocks them for their mistake and reveals that he is a monk in the employee of the powerful Cosimo Medici. The officers are taken aback by this and release the monk but Lippi still feels the need to justify himself. He launches into the story of how he ended up there that night. He tells the men that he was painting in his studio, “saints, and saints / And again saints,” and was very bored. He heard music out his window, climbed down to the street, and joined up with the procession of musicians. After celebrating for a time he was on his way home when he was stopped. Still not satisfied that they understand him, Lippo decides to tell them about his childhood and how he grew up on the street. Both of his parents died when he was young and he was forced to beg for scraps from men and dogs. He did this for a number of years before being taken into a monastery. There, he was finally able to eat his fill and indulge in his affinity for idleness. The monks attempted to make him study and learn Latin, but he says it was a waste of time. They then noticed his abilities at painting and decide that is what he should focus on. He does so, painting everything he sees, but the Prior of the monastery is not happy with what he has made. The Prior wants more soul in the art and the painter wants soul and beauty. Some of the monks are very critical of his work but he claims not to care as he has Cosimo Medici to fall back on. Even so, he does seem hurt by their rebuffs. Due to his harsh treatment at the monastery, he rebels by sneaking out in the night, as he did on the night the story is being told. He informs the guards he is speaking to that there is another young man at the monastery who is going to grow up and act just as he does. He is not an aberration. Lippo continues to speak against the monks but after a time starts to feel bad, and nervous, about what he has said. He does not want to get in trouble with the church. Lippo tells his listeners that he has a plan to get back in the good graces of the church. He is going to paint a large painting that includes God and the Madonna and child. This painting will also include a self-portrait. Lippo's guilt recedes at this point and he jumps into an entertaining narrative regarding the painted version of himself and how he will spend time with the angels. At the conclusion of this story, he tells the guards his reputation with the church will be restored in six months and runs off into the night as the sun is rising."
915,926,926,"Let the world's sharpness, like a clasping knife,
Shut in upon itself and do no harm
In this close hand of Love, now soft and warm,
And let us hear no sound of human strife
After the click of the shutting. Life to life—
I lean upon thee, Dear, without alarm,
And feel as safe as guarded by a charm
Against the stab of worldlings, who if rife
Are weak to injure. Very whitely still

Their blossoms from their roots, accessible
Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer,

The poem begins with the speaker comparing the end of the world's problems with the action of closing a “clasping knife.” The blade, or the terrors of the world, is now out of reach and cannot do harm to anyone. The hand that closed this knife belongs to Love. Or as later made clear, the hand of God's love. The speaker of this piece then turns to a companion, who is to her an embodiment of all that God's love can do, and speaks of her trust and faith in this person. She believes she will be guarded against the “worldlings.” Those who would seek to do other's harm for their own benefit. The poem concludes with the speaker promoting the love that God fosters and the strength he has to control life and death. No man will be able to change the world in the way that God's love is able to."
916,927,927,"It takes much time to kill a tree,

Not a simple jab of the knife

Will do it. It has grown
Slowly consuming the earth,
Rising out of it, feeding
Upon its crust, absorbing
Years of sunlight, air, water,
And out of its leperous hide
Sprouting leaves.

So hack and chop
But this alone wont do it.
Not so much pain will do it.
The bleeding bark will heal
And from close to the ground
Will rise curled green twigs,
Miniature boughs
Which if unchecked will expand again
To former size.

No,
The root is to be pulled out -
Out of the anchoring earth;
It is to be roped, tied,
And pulled out - snapped out
Or pulled out entirely,
Out from the earth-cave,
And the strength of the tree exposed,
The source, white and wet,
The most sensitive, hidden
For years inside the earth.

Of scorching and choking
In sun and air,

Twisting, withering,
And then it is done.","It takes much time to kill a tree, Not a simple jab of the knife","‘On Killing a Tree’ by Gieve Patel depicts a series of qualities in varying manners, including resilience, selfishness, arrogance, growth, and nurturing. These concepts are presented in various lights, all with the idea of the “tree” as a driving force. This “tree,” though it begins as something to be admired for its “strength,” changes in circumstance to become something worth pity since it ends while what it used and took for granted continues around it. In this, we can learn the value of resilience through this poem, but also see a warning of what can happen when we let purely self-driven resilience remain our sole focus."
917,928,928,"Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night
Sailed off in a wooden shoe,—
Sailed on a river of crystal light
Into a sea of dew.
""Where are you going, and what do you wish?""
The old moon asked the three.
""We have come to fish for the herring-fish
That live in this beautiful sea;
Nets of silver and gold have we,""
Said Wynken,
Blynken,
And Nod.
The old moon laughed and sang a song,
As they rocked in the wooden shoe;
And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew;
The little stars were the herring-fish
That lived in the beautiful sea.
""Now cast your nets wherever you wish,—
Never afraid are we!""
So cried the stars to the fishermen three,
Wynken,
Blynken,
And Nod.
All night long their nets they threw
To the stars in the twinkling foam,—
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe,
Bringing the fishermen home:
'Twas all so pretty a sail, it seemed
As if it could not be;
And some folk thought 'twas a dream they'd dreamed
Of sailing that beautiful sea;
But I shall name you the fishermen three:
Wynken,
Blynken,
And Nod.
Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,
And Nod is a little head,
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee one's trundle-bed;
So shut your eyes while Mother sings
Of wonderful sights that be,
And you shall see the beautiful things
As you rock in the misty sea

And Nod.","The old moon asked the three. ""We have come to fish for the herring-fish","The poem, 'Wynken, Blynken, and Nod' by Eugene Field, describes three little kids who are sailing in the sky on a wooden shoe and catch stars as herring fish. This poem presents three little kids, Wynken, Blynken, and Nod. One night, they sailed off in a wooden boat for fishing in the night sky. The stars in the sky appeared to them as herring fish and they wanted to catch them with their golden and silver nets. When they came closer to the old moon, it asked what they were doing there. They replied that they were sailing in the sky to catch the stars. Hearing that, the moon sang a song that ruffled the sky. It was hard for the children to catch the stars. At last, the little fishermen returned from their venture with what they had caught. In the last stanza, Field makes it clear that it is a fantasy story. Wynken and Blynken are nothing other than the eyes of a little child. His head is “Nod.” So, it was a dream that the child was seeing in his dream. His little bed became the wooden shoe-boat in his imagination."

He's uninterested in the things that inspire most men and women, such as wealth or love. He just wants to see the world around him and be undeterred by rules, weather, or any other restriction on his movements."

Can't I use my,"‘Toads’ by Philip Larkin tells of the two toads, or pressures, that exist within a speaker as he struggles to free himself from everyday life. The poem begins with the speaker describing how there is one thing that plagues him more than anything else: a toad. This toad represents work, exterior obligations, and financial pressures. It is always there, forcing poison into his life. Larkin’s speaker is curious about what his life would be like and if he’d be happier if he were poor. The next stanzas depict the lives of the poorest, those who struggle to find food and shelter. Although Larkin realizes the struggles of a jobless life, he thinks these people are happier than he is. Plus, he states, no one ever actually seems to starve to death. In the next section of ‘Toad,’ the speaker admits that he is never actually going to make this shift. He is not brave enough to throw off the pensions given to him by the government. This is due mostly to a second toad. This one is present within his body and forces him to keep his job. The combination of these two toads is the entire reason he is unable to change."

Throughout the poem, the speaker compares his own life to that of a house that is “shaky by nature.” He describes building the house, how he made it the way it is, “Nothing…plumb, level, or square.” The speaker gets increasingly angry as the poem continues on, angry at himself and at God, who at one point he blames for his life. The poem concludes with a reference to martyrdom in which the speaker confesses that he is determined to stay in this rickety house until it kills him. He will nail his left hand to the wall, but needs a wife, “a love,” to nail the right hand. The wife can be seen as a positive in the speaker’s life, but also as the reason his life is the way it is.

No matter who you are or the circumstances of your birth, the days of your life, there is a finite amount of time. This period gives everyone the opportunity to shape a “mass” and use their “bag of tools” to craft a life for themselves."
922,933,933,"Bulkeley, Hunt, Willard, Hosmer, Meriam, Flint,
Possessed the land which rendered to their toil
Hay, corn, roots, hemp, flax, apples, wool, and wood.
Each of these landlords walked amidst his farm,
Saying, “’Tis mine, my children’s and my name’s.
How sweet the west wind sounds in my own trees!
How graceful climb those shadows on my hill!
I fancy these pure waters and the flags
Know me, as does my dog: we sympathize;
And, I affirm, my actions smack of the soil.”
Where are these men? Asleep beneath their grounds:
And strangers, fond as they, their furrows plough.
Earth laughs in flowers, to see her boastful boys
Earth-proud, proud of the earth which is not theirs;
Who steer the plough, but cannot steer their feet
Clear of the grave.
They added ridge to valley, brook to pond,
And sighed for all that bounded their domain;
“This suits me for a pasture; that’s my park;
We must have clay, lime, gravel, granite-ledge,
And misty lowland, where to go for peat.
The land is well,—lies fairly to the south.
’Tis good, when you have crossed the sea and back,
To find the sitfast acres where you left them.”
Ah! the hot owner sees not Death, who adds
Him to his land, a lump of mould the more.
Hear what the Earth say:—
EARTH-SONG
“Mine and yours;
Mine, not yours.
Earth endures;
Stars abide—
Shine down in the old sea;
Old are the shores;
But where are old men?
I who have seen much,
Such have I never seen.
“The lawyer’s deed
Ran sure,
In tail,
To them and to their heirs
Who shall succeed,
Without fail,
Forevermore.
“Here is the land,
Shaggy with wood,
With its old valley,
Mound and flood.
But the heritors?—
Fled like the flood's foam.
The lawyer and the laws,
And the kingdom,
Clean swept herefrom.
“They called me theirs,
Who so controlled me;
Yet every one
Wished to stay, and is gone,
How am I theirs,
If they cannot hold me,
But I hold them?”
When I heard the Earth-song
I was no longer brave;
My avarice cooled
Like lust in the chill of the grave.","The land which rendered to their toil Hay, corn, roots, hemp, flax,","'Hamatreya' by Ralph Waldo Emerson is a poem about how human beings spend their lives accumulating wealth without much focusing on the fact that they are mortal. There are three sections in the poem. In the first section, the poet talks about some men namely Bulkeley, Hunt, Willard, Hosmer, Meriam, and Flint who are boastful about their wealth and well-being. But they are unaware of their mortality. In the second section, the “Earth-Song”, the poet shares what earth thinks about those men. Earth is rather in a sarcastic mood about their foolishness. In the last section, the poetic persona shares his reaction after hearing the story of those men and the song of the earth. In that last stanza, it is the poet who presents his realization."

The speaker of the poem requests his beloved to give him just one more kiss at the beginning. They must make it happen fast and forever. Thereafter, the speaker says he wants to hold her in his arms and never let her go. He loves her so much that at times it hurts. Moreover, the speaker badly wants to kiss her and wants to hear her whisperings close to his ears. It makes him weak at the knees without her. At last, the speaker asks her to marry him and by this song, he will show how much he loves her."
924,935,935,"My parents kept me from children who were rough
Who threw words like stones and wore torn clothes
Their thighs showed through rags they ran in the street
And climbed cliffs and stripped by the country streams.

I feared more than tigers their muscles like iron
Their jerking hands and their knees tight on my arms
I feared the salt coarse pointing of those boys
Who copied my lisp behind me on the road.

They were lithe they sprang out behind hedges
Like dogs to bark at my world. They threw mud
While I looked the other way, pretending to smile.
I longed to forgive them but they never smiled.",My parents kept me from children who were rough who threw words like stones and wore,"My Parents’ by Stephen Spender is a poem based on bullying and the desire to make friends. Spender describes bullies and the feeling of being bullied throughout the poem. He elaborates on his feelings using the poetic devices of Enjambment, Imagery, and Similes. ‘My Parents’ is in the first person and in an ambiguous point of view. However, we can assume that Spender was mentioning his own direct feeling’s in this poem, so it was in his own point of view. Interestingly enough, Spender has entitled his poem ‘My Parents’ despite the fact that the entire poem centers around bullying. The only thing Spender mentions about his parents is that they kept him away from these sinister boys who used to tease him. The fact that Spender named the poem ‘My Parents’ shows that he has a great appreciation for how they protected him, or perhaps it shows that he blames his parents for being the children’s target, for they did not allow him to befriend them."

In this traditional lullaby, 'Hush-a-bye', a mother tells her child not to cry and to go to sleep. If she sleeps right then, she will get “all the pretty little horses” when she wakes up. Thereafter, the mother tells her child that she will get all the horses she wants to have. By repeating the first two lines, she assures her child about the probability of fulfillment of her wish in the morning."
926,937,937,"I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contain'd,
I stand and look at them long and long.

They do not sweat and whine about their condition,
They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,
They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,
Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning things,
Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago,
Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.

So they show their relations to me and I accept them,
They bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their possession.

I wonder where they get those tokens,
Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?
Myself moving forward then and now and forever,
Gathering and showing more always and with velocity,
Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,
Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,
Picking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly terms.

A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,
Head high in the forehead, wide between the ears,
Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,
Eyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving.

His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,
His well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return.

'Animals' by Walt Whitman describes how the poet finds animals are superior to humans. They aren't superior to men for their intelligence. Rather, they are better for their nature. Whereas humans go astray from reality for their base emotions, animals keep calm. They have no regret in their lives. Nobody respect an animal still it is happy with the life it got. The poet thinks he might have left tokens or symbols of his resemblance with animals in his previous birth. As in his present life, he can visualize those token in animals."
927,938,938,"Indeed this is the sweet life! my hand
Is under no proud man's command;
There is no voice to break my rest
Before a bird has left its nest;
There is no man to change my mood,
When I go nutting in the wood;
No man to pluck my sleeve and say —
I want thy labour for this day;
No man to keep me out of sight,
When that dear Sun is shining bright.
None but my friends shall have command
Upon my time, my heart and hand;
I'll rise from sleep to help a friend,
But let no stranger orders send,
Or hear my curses fast and thick,
Which in his purse-proud throat would stick
Like burrs. If I cannot be free
To do such work as pleases me,
Near woodland pools and under trees,
You'll get no work at all, for I
Would rather live this life and die
A beggar or a thief, than be
A working slave with no days free.","I want thy labour for this day; I want no man to change my mood,","The poem reflects a desire to be “free” in happiness and time, and this desire is so strong that it is compared to slavery despite the drastic difference in levels of severity. Though mismatched, the parallel is intentionally unusual to address Davies’s true meaning."
928,939,939,"In the bedchamber window, near the glass,
Stood the little flower in the little vase,
Unnoticed quite
For a whole fortnight,
And withered for lack of watering

That a flower should waste in a nook unseen!

One needed no thought to ascertain
How it happened; that when she went in the rain
To return here not,
She was mindless what
She had left here to perish. — Ah, well: for an hour

Yet it was not much. And she never had known
Of the flower's fate; nor it of her own.","A little flower in a little vase, a mummied thing, a mum","‘The Flower’s Tragedy’ by Thomas Hardy describes the fate of a flower that was left to die without water when its owner went to her own death. The poem begins with the speaker describing the setting in which they found the flower. It was stuck in a nook, alone, in the bedchamber of a woman who had died. It had been alone for two weeks and was more a skeleton than a flower at that point. The flower appeared “mummied” as it was so waterless. As the poem continues on the reader’s sympathy for the flower grows. Even with the addition of a few details about the woman’s death, it is impossible not to feel worse for the flower and its “tragedy.” The poem concludes with this speaker wishing that they had never found the flower in the first place. Now, in a way, they must carry the weight of the flower’s terrible end."

In the first stanza of the poem, the poet uses an extended metaphor to describe a mother's worry about her daughter's future. She does not want “them” to turn her daughter into a swallow. Her assertions continue in the next two stanzas as she declares her hope that her daughter will never become a “princess” or a “queen.” Any of these outcomes would take her daughter away from her, and she would become a different person."
930,941,941,"Much have I spoken of the faded leaf;
Long have I listened to the wailing wind,
And watched it ploughing through the heavy clouds,
For autumn charms my melancholy mind.
When autumn comes, the poets sing a dirge:
The year must perish; all the flowers are dead;
The sheaves are gathered; and the mottled quail
Runs in the stubble, but the lark has fled!
Still, autumn ushers in the Christmas cheer,
The holly-berries and the ivy-tree:
They weave a chaplet for the Old Year’s bier,
These waiting mourners do not sing for me!

Where grow the ragged ferns and roughened moss;
The naked, silent trees have taught me this,—
The loss of beauty is not always loss!", Autumn charms my melancholy mind.</s,"'November' by Elizabeth Drew Barstow Stoddard describes the emotions a speaker feels in regards to the coming of autumn. The poem begins with the speaker acknowledging the fact that she speaks often about the “faded leaf.” She is soothed by the “wailing wind” and the colours of autumn. Although it signals the end of the year and the dying off of many flowers, she does not mind. It brings her a kind of peace to see time progress. By the end of the poem, she states she feels this way now because she was once told that a loss of beauty does not mean that something, or a particular time, is not valuable. She learned to love the change which comes when the old year dies."
931,942,942,"All around, shards of a lost tradition:
From the Rough Field I went to school
In the Glen of the Hazels. Close by
Was the bishopric of the Golden Stone;
The cairn of Carleton's homesick poem.

Scattered over the hills, tribal-
And placenames, uncultivated pearls.
No rock or ruin, dun or dolmen
But showed memory defying cruelty
Through an image-encrusted name.

The heathery gap where the Rapparee,
Shane Barnagh, saw his brother die -
On a summer's day the dying sun
Stained its colours to crimson:
So breaks the heart, Brish-mo-Cree.

The whole landscape a manuscript
We had lost the skill to read,
A part of our past disinherited;
But fumbled, like a blind man,
Along the fingertips of instinct.

The last Gaelic speaker in the parish
When I stammered my school Irish
One Sunday after mass, crinkled
A rusty litany of praise:
Tá an Ghaeilge againn arís . . .*

Province of the O'Niall;
The ghostly tread of O'Hagan's
Barefoot gallowglasses marching
To merge forces in Dun Geanainn

Push southward to Kinsale!
Loudly the war-cry is swallowed
In swirls of black rain and fog
As Ulster's pride, Elizabeth's foemen,
Founder in a Munster bog.
*We have the Irish again.","The Irish have returned to their homeland, and now they are a part of the world.","A Lost Tradition' deals with the poet's reminiscence of the lost tradition of Ireland. He brings out the ways that prove that a tradition is lost. The first stanza talks about the monuments and buildings being just as shards of the tradition once existed. He further explores that the tribes and the names given to the hills in the old Gaelic language are the other evidence of the tradition that is lost. He adds an incident from his childhood which proves that the language of the people is no more used. In the following stanza, he compares the city to a manuscript and the people to a blind man. Like the blind man depending on his fingertips, they also depend on the borrowed language for they have forgotten their language and their land. The poet concludes by saying that the land which was once prided and protected by the powerful rulers has lost its true identity in the name of republic and civilization."
932,943,943,"The brown wrist and hand with its raw knuckles and blue nails
packed with dirt and oil, pause in mid-air, the fingers arched delicately,

and she mimics him, hand held just so, the wrist loose,
then swooping down to the wrong chord.
She lifts her hand and tries again.

Drill collars rumble, hammering the nubbin-posts.
The helper lifts one, turning it slowly,
then lugs it into the lathe’s chuck.

into the steady chant of lathe work,

etudes, impossible counterpoint

standing in the backyard. She is speaking
to herself but not herself, as in prayer,

self-consciously: Chopin, Mozart,

Scarlatti., . . . these gestures of voice and hands

toward music, the wind dragging the hoist chain, the ring
of iron on iron in the holding rack.

The speaker in 'The Machinist, Teaching His Daughter to Play the Piano' is unspecified. Still, they speak as if they are watching two people, the machinist and his daughter, as they are practicing different skills in separate spaces. The speaker describes the machinist's dirty hands in stanza one, emphasizing their roughness and delicate position. Stanza two switches focus to the daughter, who mimics the father's hand positions while learning to play the piano. This contrasts the father and daughter and highlights the similarities between playing the piano and turning metal on a lathe. Stanzas three through five, written in italics, describe the machinist as he loads and powers up the lathe, producing a rumbling, clanging sound. Then, finally, the machinist begins to turn the metal and, meanwhile, lights a cigarette, reflecting on his memories of learning to play the piano. The speaker then shifts perspective back to the daughter, comparing the machinist's cigarette to the daughter's voice, who recites the names of famous composers in the backyard. Then, the speaker compares the sounds and motions of the machinist and the voice and gestures of the daughter, explaining that both people create art in very similar ways. The speaker closes by explaining that “one night,” the daughter speaks to her father, but she is not talking to him. Instead, she is speaking to an invisible listener who exists between them. This listener ties the daughter and her father together, and it stands in for the work that both the machinist and daughter do and the audience of the music they create together."

Within almost every line there is an exclamation of sorts that is meant to surprise and please the reader. As the poem progresses the speaker tells the reader about the noises made by trees, teapots, and mice. The poem concludes with a recognition that the imagined land described in the text is “noisy.”"
934,945,945,"There! See the line of lights,
A chain of stars down either side the street --
Why can't you lift the chain and give it to me,
A necklace for my throat? I'd twist it round
And you could play with it. You smile at me
As though I were a little dreamy child
Behind whose eyes the fairies live. . . . And see,
The people on the street look up at us
All envious. We are a king and queen,
Our royal carriage is a motor bus,
We watch our subjects with a haughty joy. . . .
How still you are! Have you been hard at work
And are you tired to-night? It is so long
Since I have seen you -- four whole days, I think.
My heart is crowded full of foolish thoughts
Like early flowers in an April meadow,
And I must give them to you, all of them,
Before they fade. The people I have met,
The play I saw, the trivial, shifting things
That loom too big or shrink too little, shadows
That hurry, gesturing along a wall,
Haunting or gay -- and yet they all grow real
And take their proper size here in my heart
When you have seen them. . . . There's the Plaza now,
A lake of light! To-night it almost seems
That all the lights are gathered in your eyes,
Drawn somehow toward you. See the open park
Lying below us with a million lamps
Scattered in wise disorder like the stars.
We look down on them as God must look down
On constellations floating under Him
Tangled in clouds. . . . Come, then, and let us walk
Since we have reached the park. It is our garden,
All black and blossomless this winter night,
But we bring April with us, you and I;
We set the whole world on the trail of spring.
I think that every path we ever took
Has marked our footprints in mysterious fire,
Delicate gold that only fairies see.
When they wake up at dawn in hollow tree-trunks
And come out on the drowsy park, they look
Along the empty paths and say, ""Oh, here
They went, and here, and here, and here! Come, see,
Here is their bench, take hands and let us dance
About it in a windy ring and make
A circle round it only they can cross
When they come back again!"" . . . Look at the lake --
Do you remember how we watched the swans
That night in late October while they slept?
Swans must have stately dreams, I think. But now
The lake bears only thin reflected lights
That shake a little. How I long to take
One from the cold black water -- new-made gold
To give you in your hand! And see, and see,
There is a star, deep in the lake, a star!
Oh, dimmer than a pearl -- if you stoop down
Your hand could almost reach it up to me. . . .

There was a new frail yellow moon to-night --
I wish you could have had it for a cup
With stars like dew to fill it to the brim. . . .

How cold it is! Even the lights are cold;
They have put shawls of fog around them, see!
What if the air should grow so dimly white
That we would lose our way along the paths
Made new by walls of moving mist receding
The more we follow. . . . What a silver night!
That was our bench the time you said to me
The long new poem -- but how different now,
How eerie with the curtain of the fog
Making it strange to all the friendly trees!
There is no wind, and yet great curving scrolls
Carve themselves, ever changing, in the mist.
Walk on a little, let me stand here watching
To see you, too, grown strange to me and far. . . .
I used to wonder how the park would be
If one night we could have it all alone --
No lovers with close arm-encircled waists
To whisper and break in upon our dreams.
And now we have it! Every wish comes true!

Even the stars have gone.

In the first part of 'A November Night,' the speaker begins by excitedly commenting on all the lights she can see around her. There are the stars as well as the lights that border the street and come up from the park. These attract her, and she expresses her feeling that they are drawn to her partner's eyes. Together, they're walking through the night while she stumbles upon memories and shares her thoughts about everything they have seen. As the poem goes on, the darkness of the night expands, and a mist covers the stars that have been looking down upon them. This changes the atmosphere of the poem, and the speaker starts to comment on how cold it is and how strange everything looks in this light. This odd moment in which the two have the park to themselves is one that she's been seeking for a while. Now they have it, and they're alone in the darkness with everything familiar obscured."

The poem begins with her stating that she has made “A thousand martyrs” to the cause of her own pleasure. They come to her willingly, and she burns them up until she is tired of them. When these undefined people first came to her they were wild and “wandering” in thought. Her “hand” controlled and changed them. In the second stanza, the speaker states that no move she made was done in “vain.” She did not waste a single word. They were all well “reciev'd” by those who would become her martyrs. In the second half, she explains how the “fair” does not have to wait long for their wishes to be granted. People will do whatever they can to please the most beautiful in society. In the final stanza, she relishes in the fact that she has not had to put out any effort to get what she has. She can carry away her earnings, laughing as she does. There were no pains of hell, only joys of heaven."
936,947,947,"My Uncle Giuseppe told me
that in Sicily in World War Two,
in the courtyard behind the aquarium,
where the bougainvillea grows so well,
the only captive mermaid in the world
was butchered on the dry and dusty ground
by a doctor, a fishmonger, and certain others.

She, it, had never learned to speak
because she was simple, or so they’d said,
but the priest who held one of her hands
while her throat was cut,
said she was only a fish, and fish can’t speak.
But she screamed like a woman in terrible fear.

And when they took a ripe golden roe
from her side, the doctor said
this was proof she was just a fish
and anyway an egg is not a child,
but refused when some was offered to him.

Then they put her head and her hands
in a box for burial
and someone tried to take her wedding ring,
but the others stopped him,
and the ring stayed put.

The rest they cooked and fed to the troops.
They said a large fish had been found on the beach.

Starvation forgives men many things,
my uncle, the aquarium keeper, said,
but couldn’t look me in the eye,
for which I thank God.",The only captive mermaid in the world was butchered on the dry and dust,"'Giuseppe' by Roderick Ford tells of the moral consequences associated with the violent murder of a mermaid during the Second World War. The poem begins with the speaker setting the scene. There was a group of people in Sicily and in their desperate starved state they butchered a mermaid behind the aquarium. At first, they thought that she was simply a fish and there would be no issue killing her. This was mostly due to the fact that she had never learned to speak. They kill her, and she screams as a woman would scream. This is the first moment they doubt their own actions. All this information comes from a story his uncle used to tell the speaker. He is getting it second hand. As the poem progresses their argument that she was simply a fish gets harder and harder to maintain. She has eggs, but no one will eat them as they seem more like babies than anything else. They bury her head and hands and do not take her “wedding ring.” Eventually, they feed the troops with the rest of her body and tell everyone the meat came from a big fish they found. By the end of the poem it is clear that the uncle felt guilty over the death of this woman, but (mostly) excuses the men's actions because they were starving."
937,948,948,"Amid the glare of light and song
And talk that knows not when to cease, The sullen voices of the throng,
My weary soul cries out for peace, Peace and the quietness of death;
The wash of waters deep and cool, The wind too faint for any breath

When all who swim against the stream,
And they that laugh, and they that weep, Shall change like flowers in a dream
That wither on the brows of sleep.
For silence is the song sublime,
And every voice at last must cease, And all the world at evening time
Floats downwards through the gates of peace, Beyond the gloom of shadowy caves
Where water washes on the stones, And breaks with quiet foamless waves

It is clear from the first lines that Gore-Booth's speaker wants to escape from her life. Her soul is weary of those around her and the sounds she cannot rid herself of. Everything is loud and constantly present. The majority of the poem is made up of the speaker describing death and the peace she knows she could find there. Death is a place where everyone would become mute. The only sounds present would be the crashing of water on rocks. Her vision would always be full of stars, the sea, and the moonlight on the water. These are all calm and steady sights. She does not believe she could live this kind of life at present."

Alone and palely loitering?
The sedge has withered from the lake,
And no birds sing.
O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
So haggard and so woe-begone?
The squirrel’s granary is full,
And the harvest’s done.
I see a lily on thy brow,
With anguish moist and fever-dew,
And on thy cheeks a fading rose
Fast withereth too.
I met a lady in the meads,
Full beautiful—a faery’s child,
Her hair was long, her foot was light,
And her eyes were wild.
I made a garland for her head,
And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;
She looked at me as she did love,
And made sweet moan
I set her on my pacing steed,
And nothing else saw all day long,
For sidelong would she bend, and sing
A faery’s song.
She found me roots of relish sweet,
And honey wild, and manna-dew,
And sure in language strange she said—
‘I love thee true’.
She took me to her Elfin grot,
And there she wept and sighed full sore,
And there I shut her wild wild eyes
With kisses four.
And there she lullèd me asleep,
And there I dreamed—Ah! woe betide!—
The latest dream I ever dreamt
On the cold hill side.
I saw pale kings and princes too,
Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;
They cried—‘La Belle Dame sans Merci
Thee hath in thrall!’
I saw their starved lips in the gloam,
With horrid warning gapèd wide,
And I awoke and found me here,
On the cold hill’s side.
And this is why I sojourn here,
Alone and palely loitering,
Though the sedge is withered from the lake,
And no birds sing.","O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms, Alone an","'La Belle Dame sans Merci' by John Keats is a beautiful poem about a fairy who condemns a knight after seducing him with her singing and looks. The first three stanzas introduce the unidentified speaker and the knight. The speaker comes across the knight wandering around in the dead of winter when “the sedge has withered from the lake/ And no birds sing.” In this way, Keats depicts a barren and bleak landscape. The knight responds to the speaker, telling him how he met a lady in the meadows who was “full beautiful, a faery's child”. Here, Keats' language sweetens. The first three stanzas were bitter and devoid of emotion, but the introduction of the “lady in the meads” produces softness in the language of the knight. He reminisces on the lady's beauty and her apparent innocence – her long hair, light feet, and wild eyes – and on her otherworldliness, as well. Moreover, he describes his sweet memories of the Lady: feeding each other, giving her presents, traveling with her, and being together. In the eighth stanza, the lady weeps for she knows that they cannot be together as she is a fairy, and he is a mortal. She lulls him to sleep out of which he does not immediately wake. In his dream, the knight sees pale people like kings, princes, and warriors. They tell him that he has been enthralled by the woman without mercy. He wakes up from the nightmare alone, on the cold hillside, and tells the persona that is why he stays there, wandering, looking for the lady. The last stanza leaves the fate of the knight ambiguous."

The poem is directed at “you,” an unknown listener who stands in for all readers and listeners of the poem. Everyone can put themselves in this person's shoes. They are told, by the speaker, that they should put their work to the side and take pleasure in a moment of peace. The two can sit and talk about nothing or just stare off into space. The twenty minutes that they spend together is going to be important for the speaker. Then, he adds in the end, they will be observed by grackles, a kind of small blackbird, the whole time. This alludes to the fact of observation throughout the rest of one's life."

In the final lines, the speaker says that an immoral person would never have “Beauty” or “Love” by their side. He feels strongly about this, as indicated in the language, tone, and mood of the poem."

This poem is inspired by Horace's Poem 11 from Odes, Book 1. It is not clear whether Leuconoe is a real or fictional character, but the Greek name is usually used for females. In the beginning, the speaker (Horace) advises her that she should stop looking into the future that is “appointed by the gods for you and me.” It refers to the fate that Gods bestowed upon them. Further, he urges her to stop seeing the “Chaldean figures”—Chaldeans were an ancient group of people who lived and ruled Babylonia from 625 to 539 BC. They were known to be great astronomers and astrologers. Here, Horace asks Leuconoe not to seek the Chaldean Numerology in order to predict her future. According to the speaker, it is better to live in the moment than to wonder how many winters Jove, the king of god in ancient Roman religion, has in store for them. Overall, the poet sums up the sonnet by saying that let tomorrow come with what it wants, but it is always better to focus on the present moment."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that it was on an early Sunday morning that he, and his companions, set out to see the whales. They were intentionally going out to see blue whales and traveled to a set of islands off the coast of California, the “Farallones.” The speaker is successful in his quest and the rest of the poem is devoted to describing that experience. He frequently takes note of the grace of their bodies, as well as their general mass. He is amazed by their movements, and struck by the “diminutive” nature of their dorsal fins. The whales dive back under the water, rolling through the waves, showing off all the markings of their bodies. The display finally ends when they dive into the depths, leaving the narrator with the image of their “flukes,” or tail fins."

The poem begins with the speaker commanding all women of the world, especially those that have been stepped on and oppressed, to rise up and “assert” their rights. They should attempt to retake their place as leaders of the “empire. She tells them that it is time for man to step down from his throne and kiss the scepter of woman. The weapons that will be used in a woman's bid for the thrones of the world will be fought using the things that society has given her. She will use her blushes and “soft melting tones” to defeat mankind. Once having gained some power, a woman should not stop until she is in command of all of the empire, not just part. She will not be able to make friends with mankind, they must be subservient to the needs of women. In the final stanzas the speaker warns the women of the world that if they do regain power, they must not let themselves get weak. While Nature might try to sway them into some kind of reconciliation with man, they must not lite their “coldness” decrease. The maintaining of power must be at the forefront of their minds at all times."

He describes the fact that there is no place or time on Earth in which these “whole-hearted” and “eager” men shall be returned to “us.” They were given up by the British government and military, without a second thought. Additionally, within the first stanzas, the speaker asks whether the men responsible for this loss will be held to account for it, or if they will go unpunished. In the second half of the poem, the speaker begins to direct his questions to the reader. He wants to know if the public will be able to keep up the outrage that “we” feel over what has happened, or if these emotions will pass without consequence."

Throughout this poem, Brontë's speaker describes her relationship to the listener, someone who is easily described as her lover. The two are forced to part from one another, but the speaker knows this isn't the end. No matter how far they go or what boundaries the world puts up in their way, they still have their memories. Plus, when feeling most alone, they can send out their thoughts to one another and be together as they used to."

The idea of Nature as an outward and visible expression of the presence of Christ is found in the New Testament, where Christ is described as: “a Son who is the radiance of his Father’s splendor and the full expression of his being; all creation depends for its support on his enabling word.” In the radiance and energy of an autumn day, Hopkins meets his Christ whose fire, beauty, and energy suffuse all created forms. Christ is seen by the poet as embodied in the power and beauty of the hills; Christ’s power and beauty are then found reflected in the proud stallion and the modest violet. The full power and beauty of a scene of Nature are released only when a human witness arrives there; then this power and beauty lends wings to the human heart which almost leaves behind earthly existence and soars upwards to the sky in a mood of ecstasy."

In a form of writing where ideas and images can be representative of entirely different things, an evocation of emotion is the strongest tool for relaying an idea through metaphor or any other poetic device. In Thomas Hardy’s ‘Overlooking the River Stour’, evocation is the primary storytelling device; it is a work heavy with imagery and metaphor and one that relays feeling without expressing feeling, something that is generally very difficult to do — and yet, ‘Overlooking the River Stour’ is a vast creative display of emotion-charged scenery."

The poem begins by introducing the image of the poppy that has come to be closely associated with remembering World War I. The narrator states that in Flanders, the poppies are blowing in rows between the rows of crosses marking the graves of fallen soldiers. The reader gets an idea that this field is vast and covered with crosses marking graves, and simply placed as remembrances for fallen men. Above them, larks are flying and “bravely singing” above the gun fire below. The second stanza describes the men as they once were. They used to live as the reader does now, feeling the sun, and loving and being loved. The poet is hoping to create empathy between the reader/readers and those fallen. He hopes to create a firmer image in the reader's mind as to what these men were like. Now though, they have all passed. They lie now “in Flanders fields.” The final stanza is a call to arms. The poet is speaking directly to the reader telling them that it is now their turn to fight and stand up against the forces that are seeking to destroy them. They must take the torch from the “failing hands” of the dead and live on for them. The poem concludes by stating that unless their war is fought on by others, they will never rest, even if they do lie amongst the poppies."

Perhaps her most well-known poem, it centers around the theme of loss and the way in which the speaker – and, by extension, the reader – deals with it. Here, Bishop converts losing into an art form and explores how, by potentially mastering this skill, we may distance ourselves from the pain of loss. At eight months old, Elizabeth Bishop lost her father, her mother then succumbed to mental illness and she later lost her lover to suicide. Therefore, we may see this poem as in part autobiographical. In it, the poet presents a list of things we may lose in life, increasing in importance, until the final culmination in the loss of a loved one."

There is a refrain at the end of this stanza and the next that suggests a specific way the speaker would like to die. This isn't detailed until the final stanza. She also explores the movements in the sky and how they appear as a serpent, swallowing up the stars that are, perhaps, produced by the god-like sun. The final stanza describes how she wants to be swallowed by this same beast and taken into the sky without a “flag” or a “cry.”"

Love that never told can be

A traveller came by
Silently invisibly
O was no deny",Never seek to tell thy love love that never told can be for the gentle wind does,"‘Never Seek to Tell thy Love’ by William Blake describes one man’s choice to reveal his true feelings to his “love” and the failure of that effort. The poem begins with the speaker telling his readers that if one I seeking out an opportunity to confess one’s feelings of affection for another, don’t. It will be a mistake that will lead to nothing good. The speaker compares what would seem to be a simple confession to a “gentle wind.” Just because one cannot see it, does not mean it will not be felt and make an impact. He then goes on to tell of his own past and what happened when he confessed to his “love.” He told his truth and she turned from him, she did not return his affections, but departed. It was a life-changing moment for him, but not a happy one. In the last stanza, he describes his own surprise at this turn of events and the fact that even though his life has changed the world is moving on. The changes that he felt, while invisible, still carry a big impact. He must move on with the world to avoid being frozen in that state for the rest of time."

In the first lines, 'Remember,' the poet asks the listener to remember their history and how it connects to the universe. They are a part of the birth of the universe, the sun, and the moon. They should remember the role their parents played in giving them life and how they gave their father and mother life as well. She moves on to discuss how interconnected all people are to one another and the other lives around them. Animals and plants all have their families and histories. They should be respected and listened to."

959,970,970,"There are many that I miss
having sent my last one out a car window
sparking along the road one night, years ago.

The heralded one, of course:
after sex, the two glowing tips
now the lights of a single ship;
at the end of a long dinner
with more wine to come
and a smoke ring coasting into the chandelier;
or on a white beach,
holding one with fingers still wet from a swim.

How bittersweet these punctuations
of flame and gesture;
but the best were on those mornings
when I would have a little something going
in the typewriter,
the sun bright in the windows,
maybe some Berlioz on in the background.
I would go into the kitchen for coffee
and on the way back to the page,
curled in its roller,
I would light one up and feel
its dry rush mix with the dark taste of coffee.

Then I would be my own locomotive,
trailing behind me as I returned to work
little puffs of smoke,
indicators of progress,
signs of industry and thought,
the signal that told the nineteenth century
it was moving forward.
That was the best cigarette,
when I would steam into the study
full of vaporous hope
and stand there,
the big headlamp of my face
pointed down at all the words in parallel lines.",The best cigarette was the one that I would steam into the study full of vaporous,"The Best Cigarette' by Billy Collins uses past experiences with smoking to describe the important in-between, transitory moments in one's life. The poem begins with the speaker describing how there are many cigarettes he misses, but there are some that are more important than others. He goes through a number of examples, explaining that cigarettes after dinner, sex, and swimming are some of the most poignant in his mind. The third and fourth stanzas are dedicated to the experiences with smoking he misses the most. He discusses how he'd always have coffee and a cigarette while writing if he thought it was going well."

unworthy of the labor spent on it.

the fifth pig smarting, pressed against the glass

a second foot is squeezed into the vamp.

The slipper strains against those excess feet.
She hobbles onward—she has a prince to meet.","The step-sister’s big feet are a sigh of relief, but","“Glass Slipper Sonnet” by Angela Alaimo O’Donnell takes the classic tale of Cinderella and trades in the typical approach of focusing sympathy and understanding on Cinderella herself to discuss the life of one “step-sister.” That life turns out to be one that is sad and hopeless since the “step-sister” realizes she does not fit into “the slipper,” but she is so accustomed to the notion of not fitting in that she is willing to overlook the detail to reach for a royal life with “a prince.” Despite her efforts, the ill-fit of the “shoe[s]” cannot be hidden due to their impact on her “stride,” and that inability to fit into something she is not matched for is a representation of how she cannot move away from her station in life to become anything higher. What is worse is the poem makes it clear that she has learned to feel out of place, meaning her entire life could be represented in her struggles with “the slipper[s].” She has never fit in, and nothing in her present situation allows her a way to change that. For these details, “[p]ity” is a reasonable response for her story."
961,972,972,"———The sky is overcast
With a continuous cloud of texture close,
Heavy and wan, all whitened by the Moon,
Which through that veil is indistinctly seen,
A dull, contracted circle, yielding light
So feebly spread, that not a shadow falls,
Chequering the ground—from rock, plant, tree, or tower.
At length a pleasant instantaneous gleam
Startles the pensive traveller while he treads
His lonesome path, with unobserving eye
Bent earthwards; he looks up—the clouds are split
Asunder,—and above his head he sees
The clear Moon, and the glory of the heavens.
There, in a black-blue vault she sails along,
Followed by multitudes of stars, that, small
And sharp, and bright, along the dark abyss
Drive as she drives: how fast they wheel away,
Yet vanish not!—the wind is in the tree,
But they are silent;—still they roll along
Immeasurably distant; and the vault,
Built round by those white clouds, enormous clouds,
Still deepens its unfathomable depth.
At length the Vision closes; and the mind,
Not undisturbed by the delight it feels,
Which slowly settles into peaceful calm,
Is left to muse upon the solemn scene.","The sky is overcast, Heavy and wan, all whitened by the Moon","“A Night-Piece” by William Wordsworth details a brief moment in which the speaker, as well as a traveler on the ground below, marvel over the majesty of the sky, moon, and clouds above them. The sky is initially cast as a mysterious, dark place, but this image is soon broken as the clouds separate and the moon burst through, surprising the ”pensive” traveler on the ground. The power of the moon is described, as “she” moves through the sky and is followed by the stars that always keep pace with her. These images are used as a metaphor for the power and consistent presence of God. Even when God, or the light of the moon in this case, cannot be seen, it does not mean it is not there. The poem concludes with the breaking of this religiously inspired moment with nature, and the speaker and traveler are calmer, and better, for it. Their minds muse on the experience as all continues as it did before."

In each stanza, the poet repeats the same pattern of lines to show the repetition of the year, as well as the constant changes that come over the land."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that she is untouched by fear. The love she has for God, and the power with which she has been bestowed, due to that love, make her unafraid of death. She describes others who are not of the same moral caliber as she is, and sees them as less. She calls them “Vain” and makes sure to inform the reader that any temptation that might come her way is hopeless against the “boundless main” which is her faith. The speaker knows that God's love is without limits. There is nothing that could happen to her, or happen to the world that would eradicate that. The poem concludes with the speaker once more stating that although death is powerful “he” is nothing against the strength of God."

'Climbing My Grandfather' by Andrew Waterhouse is an open letter of admiration for his grandfather. The poet remembers a time when he was a child and his grandfather looked to him more like a giant than a human being. As a child, the poet talks about the massiveness of his grandfather, and vividly describes from 'toe to head' the physical structure of his grandfather imagining him like a mountain. Since the poem starts with the present tense it makes us feel as if we are also climbing with him. Moreover, the very title of the poem tells us what the poet is going to discuss though it creates a little confusion at first. But it becomes clear as we read in the poem to the end."

Throughout the stanzas of 'The Thrush,' the speaker addresses a thrush he can see signing on a branch. He wonders about the bird's thought process and if it has any idea about the passing of the seasons. Does it know, he thinks, about November and April? Or does it live only in happy moments and sad ones, ones in which it can't sing and ones in which it can. It's the latter that he decides upon and he concludes the poem by suggesting that there is some beauty in this perspective on life."

In the following two stanzas, the poet says what he really wants to say to his beloved. There is still something left in his heart that he wants to tell her about. Moreover, in the last stanza, the poet sighs for the “long, long” years that he has to live alone with a sad heart. What is left in him, is the endless heartache. It will only end in eternal sleep."
967,978,978,"By channels of coolness the echoes are calling,
And down the dim gorges I hear the creek falling;
It lives in the mountain, where moss and the sedges
Touch with their beauty the banks and the ledges;
Through brakes of the cedar and sycamore bowers
Struggles the light that is love to the flowers.
And, softer than slumber, and sweeter than singing,
The notes of the bell-birds are running and ringing.
The silver-voiced bell-birds, the darlings of day-time,
They sing in September their songs of the May-time.
When shadows wax strong and the thunder-bolts hurtle,
They hide with their fear in the leaves of the myrtle;
When rain and the sunbeams shine mingled together
They start up like fairies that follow fair weather,
And straightway the hues of their feathers unfolden
Are the green and the purple, the blue and the golden.
October, the maiden of bright yellow tresses,
Loiters for love in these cool wildernesses;
Loiters knee-deep in the grasses to listen,
Where dripping rocks gleam and the leafy pools glisten.
Then is the time when the water-moons splendid
Break with their gold, and are scattered or blended
Over the creeks, till the woodlands have warning
Of songs of the bell-bird and wings of the morning.
Welcome as waters unkissed by the summers
Are the voices of bell-birds to thirsty far-comers.
When fiery December sets foot in the forest,
And the need of the wayfarer presses the sorest,
Pent in the ridges for ever and ever.
The bell-birds direct him to spring and to river,
With ring and with ripple, like runnels whose torrents
Are toned by the pebbles and leaves in the currents.

Mixt with the sights and the sounds of the wildwood,
Longing for power and the sweetness to fashion
Lyrics with beats like the heart-beats of passion --
Songs interwoven of lights and of laughters
Borrowed from bell-birds in far forest rafters;

The beauty and strength of the deep mountain valleys,
Charming to slumber the pain of my losses
With glimpses of creeks and a vision of mosses.","The echoes are calling, And down the dim gorges I hear the creek falling","'Bell Birds' by Henry Kendall describes the beauty of a local wooded landscape and the passion and inspiration a speaker gains from its depths. The poem begins with the speaker describing the general outline of the forest. It is a place in which he can see the “mountain” and take a long look at the “mosses and sedges.” Additionally, he can hear the waters of the rivers and the singing of the “bell-birds.” As the poem continues the speaker devotes his time to describe what the best season of the year, spring, is like. This is when the birds are at their most passionate and the yellow and golden wattles are shining. Eventually, summer comes but the beauty is not decreased. This does mark a change in the text though. The speaker introduces a “wayfarer” who is likely a separate version of himself. This person is seeking out relief in the woods, in the form of water, and the birds guide him to it. In conclusion, he states that he wants to be able to capture the beauty of the forest in his “Song” or writings. This would allow him to take it back to the city where he needs it the most."

Garlic and sapphires in the mud
Clot the bedded axle-tree.
The trilling wire in the blood
Sings below inveterate scars
Appeasing long forgotten wars.
The dance along the artery
The circulation of the lymph
Are figured in the drift of stars
Ascend to summer in the tree
We move above the moving tree
In light upon the figured leaf
And hear upon the sodden floor
Below, the boarhound and the boar
Pursue their pattern as before
But reconciled among the stars.
At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless;
Neither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is,
But neither arrest nor movement. And do not call it fixity,
Where past and future are gathered. Neither movement from nor towards,
Neither ascent nor decline. Except for the point, the still point,
There would be no dance, and there is only the dance.
I can only say, there we have been: but I cannot say where.
And I cannot say, how long, for that is to place it in time.
The inner freedom from the practical desire,
The release from action and suffering, release from the inner
And the outer compulsion, yet surrounded
By a grace of sense, a white light still and moving,
Erhebung without motion, concentration
Without elimination, both a new world
And the old made explicit, understood
In the completion of its partial ecstasy,
The resolution of its partial horror.
Yet the enchainment of past and future
Woven in the weakness of the changing body,
Protects mankind from heaven and damnation
Which flesh cannot endure.
Time past and time future
Allow but a little consciousness.
To be conscious is not to be in time

The moment in the arbour where the rain beat,
The moment in the draughty church at smokefall
Be remembered; involved with past and future.
Only through time time is conquered.

Here is a place of disaffection
Time before and time after
In a dim light: neither daylight
Investing form with lucid stillness
Turning shadow into transient beauty
With slow rotation suggesting permanence
Nor darkness to purify the soul
Emptying the sensual with deprivation
Cleansing affection from the temporal.
Neither plenitude nor vacancy. Only a flicker
Over the strained time-ridden faces
Distracted from distraction by distraction
Filled with fancies and empty of meaning
Tumid apathy with no concentration
Men and bits of paper, whirled by the cold wind
That blows before and after time,
Wind in and out of unwholesome lungs
Time before and time after.
Eructation of unhealthy souls
Into the faded air, the torpid
Driven on the wind that sweeps the gloomy hills of London,
Hampstead and Clerkenwell, Campden and Putney,
Highgate, Primrose and Ludgate. Not here
Not here the darkness, in this twittering world.
Descend lower, descend only
Into the world of perpetual solitude,
World not world, but that which is not world,
Internal darkness, deprivation
And destitution of all property,
Desiccation of the world of sense,
Evacuation of the world of fancy,
Inoperancy of the world of spirit;
This is the one way, and the other
Is the same, not in movement
But abstention from movement; while the world moves
In appetency, on its metalled ways
Of time past and time future.

The black cloud carries the sun away.
Will the sunflower turn to us, will the clematis
Stray down, bend to us; tendril and spray

Has answered light to light, and is silent, the light is still
At the still point of the turning world.

Words move, music moves
Only in time; but that which is only living
Can only die. Words, after speech, reach
Into the silence. Only by the form, the pattern,
Can words or music reach
The stillness, as a Chinese jar still
Moves perpetually in its stillness.
Not the stillness of the violin, while the note lasts,
Not that only, but the co-existence,
Or say that the end precedes the beginning,
And the end and the beginning were always there
Before the beginning and after the end.
And all is always now. Words strain,
Crack and sometimes break, under the burden,
Under the tension, slip, slide, perish,
Decay with imprecision, will not stay in place,
Will not stay still. Shrieking voices
Scolding, mocking, or merely chattering,
Always assail them. The Word in the desert
Is most attacked by voices of temptation,
The crying shadow in the funeral dance,
The loud lament of the disconsolate chimera.
The detail of the pattern is movement,
As in the figure of the ten stairs.
Desire itself is movement
Not in itself desirable;
Love is itself unmoving,
Only the cause and end of movement,
Timeless, and undesiring
Except in the aspect of time
Caught in the form of limitation
Between un-being and being.
Sudden in a shaft of sunlight
Even while the dust moves
There rises the hidden laughter
Of children in the foliage
Quick now, here, now, always—
Ridiculous the waste sad time
Stretching before and after.","If all time is eternally present, All time is unredeemable.

Dead loves that were born for me.",O stony grey soil of Monaghan The laugh from my love you thie,"Stony Grey Soil' by Patrick Kavanagh describes the poet's own youth and the joys that his home, Monaghan, took from him. The poem begins with the speaker giving a few details about his home. These details quickly expand and it becomes clear that the poet did not enjoy his youth. In fact, he believes that he didn't really have one. From a young age the happiness of boyhood was crushed. His dreams were squashed and hopeful ideas were snuffed out. They were replaced by the immortality of farming and the necessity of farming equipment. In the last couple of stanzas, the speaker explains how all this negativity in his childhood made him the person he is while writing the poem. His verses are influenced by the poisoned pen of “stony grey” Monaghan. While the county took a lot from him, it gave him the “Dead loves” that populate his verse."

The poem takes the reader through the death room of an unnamed woman. It looked out over Leamington Spa and held on to a quiet peace, even after her passing. Silence permeates every line of this poem, even the ones that contain dialogue as the nurse speaks out loud. Unaware that the woman has passed away, the nurse talks to her. Her voice breaks this silence, therefore drawing a reader's attention to its absence. The nurse, upon realizing the woman has died, slips back into quiet and moves respectfully out of the room."

The poem opens with the speaker addressing a group who understands life as he does. He's been away from his home for a long time, creating a career for himself. He's returned, and things are not as he expected. The poet uses allusions, both to the Bible and to Greek mythology, in order to paint a picture of the situation. He does not feel accepted, nor does he feel the same love for his home he once did. His new, broader understanding of the world has made what was beautiful, and welcoming feel off-putting and, at times, scary."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that there is a place near the banks of a river, on a bridge, where lovers meet. This place is filled with love, and often plays host to kissing couples, as is seen in line six. It is to this place that the speaker goes when they want to feel close to God. They are able to commune with nature and, in part, fulfill their senses and hungry spirituality. Eventually, the speaker asks God, and the wider world of nature, to accept them. They want to be able to live unselfconsciously and to wear a “new dress” that is made of “questions unanswered.” This person is seeking a new way of being in the world that is not defined by city life or purely secular thought."
973,984,984,"Thou spark of life that wavest wings of gold,
Thou songless wanderer mid the songful birds,
With Nature's secrets in thy tints unrolled
Through gorgeous cipher, past the reach of words,
Yet dear to every child
In glad pursuit beguiled,
Living his unspoiled days mid flowers and flocks and herds!

Thou winged blossom, liberated thing,
What secret tie binds thee to other flowers,
Still held within the garden's fostering?
Will they too soar with the completed hours,
Take flight, and be like thee
Irrevocably free,
Hovering at will o'er their parental bowers?

Or is thy luster drawn from heavenly hues, -
A sumptuous drifting fragment of the sky,
Caught when the sunset its last glance imbues
With sudden splendor, and the tree-tops high
Grasp that swift blazonry,
Then lend those tints to thee,
On thee to float a few short hours, and die?

Birds have their nests; they rear their eager young,
And flit on errands all the livelong day;
Each fieldmouse keeps the homestead whence it sprung;
But thou art Nature's freeman, - free to stray
Unfettered through the wood,
Seeking thine airy food,
The sweetness spiced on every blossomed spray.

The garden one wide banquet spreads for thee,
O daintiest reveller of the joyous earth!
One drop of honey gives satiety;
A second draught would drug thee past all mirth.
Thy feast no orgy shows;
Thy calm eyes never close,
Thou soberest sprite to which the sun gives birth.

And yet the soul of man upon thy wings
Forever soars in aspiration; thou
His emblem of the new career that springs
When death's arrest bids all his spirit bow.
He seeks his hope in thee
Of immortality.

Here the poet portrays it as a symbol of life and free-spirit. This poem begins with a reference to the butterfly as the “spark of life”. Thereafter, the poet goes on comparing the butterfly with other creatures of nature. According to the poet, the butterfly symbolizes the essence of life and its lovely wings symbolize freedom. The speaker of the poem thinks it to be a fostering child of nature. It gets its hue from the heavens and feeds on the honey that soothes its soul, not inebriates it. At last, the poet describes it as a “Symbol of life” and seeks hope from the creature."

In the first lines of this poem the speaker addresses the nature of serving in India. This includes the heat, the atmosphere, war, and those he spent time with. There was one person specifically that sticks out in his mind from this experience, Gunga Din. He was an Indian man working with the English soldiers. This brave and much-maligned man was responsible for bringing water to the soldiers whenever they needed it. These men, including the speaker, beat and mistreated Gunga Din. Everything changed when the speaker was shot on the battlefield. Gunga Din came to him, gave him water, and helped staunch his wound. It was this kindness and the fact that Gunga Din died for the efforts that changed the speaker's opinion of him."

The main sickness explored is lung pain, with Huffman portraying a constant pain she carries around. The use of water imagery suggests the tainting of something pure, reflecting the lung becoming infected. There is no sense of rest in the poem. One can assume the 'Rest' that Huffman refers to in the title is an oncoming sense of dying. The poem is tragic, exploring the physical impacts of sickness upon the human body."

Having been living in the city for a long time, the person finds life at the countryside, mind-blowing and nature, awe-inspiring. The speaker captures the delight of the city-dweller beautifully as he moves and breathes in the open air and his heart is filled with the joy of the sky that is free from dust, smoke, and the bustle of city life. The city-dweller feels the happiness of heaven on earth. Eventually, the day ends he returns home. On his way back too, he enjoys the sweet song of the nightingale and the clouds floating about the sky. The day rolled by quickly, that the poet compares it to the tear of the Angel flowing down through the clear sky unnoticed."

This piece is written in the context of the Gulf War. Lux shows how people from a particular nation hate that of the other due to their distinct culture, origin, and identity. He uses the metaphor of villagers in order to hint at the people living in two different countries. They showed extreme hatred and distrust toward one another. Their discord did not originate from the misdoings or inhumane acts of a particular group. In this poem, Lux records a list of things that they did to each other."

And now I must bid you good-bye!
I've filled you with laughter, I've thrilled you with song,
And sometimes I've wished I could cry.
Your walls they have witnessed a weariful fight,
And rung to a won Waterloo:
But oh, in my triumph I'm dreary to-night --
Good-bye, little cabin, to you!
Your roof is bewhiskered, your floor is a-slant,
Your walls seem to sag and to swing;
I'm trying to find just your faults, but I can't --
You poor, tired, heart-broken old thing!
I've seen when you've been the best friend that I had,
Your light like a gem on the snow;
You're sort of a part of me -- Gee! but I'm sad;
I hate, little cabin, to go.

A hornet's nest hangs from a beam;
Your rafters are scribbled with adage and rhyme,
And dimmed with tobacco and dream.

Moose antlers nailed over your door:

It is also one of his more emotional pieces, and serves as a solid way of demonstrating that he very much knew his way around poetic devices; his strong command of verse is good enough to make the reader care both about the narrator and the inanimate object being described! This poem showcases many of Service’s strengths as a poet and creates a clear understanding of the reader of the powerful pull that can be created even by one little cabin."

The poem begins with the speaker alluding to the day that Queen Elizabeth will pass away. It's represented by the evening, which will eventually usurp the “determined” afternoon. The poet continues in this way, relating time and seasons to Queen Elizabeth's life. He brings in images of a Lily of the Valley flower and connects its features to Queen Elizabeth. It's stern and “shining,” just as she was. This provides a transition into a clear allusion to her recent passing. The speaker describes her hands as having been relieved of the weight of her reign upon her death. In the poem's second part, the speaker begins by saying that evening is finally here. Queen Elizabeth passed away, something that's seen physically in the British landscape, particularly in Scotland, where she died in Balmoral castle, which is consumed by rain. In amongst this darkness is the bright Lily of the Valley flower that is “restrained” and “forceful.” It depicts her “singular voice” that was at the heart of British life for so long. The poem concludes with an allusion to the vast impact that Queen Elizabeth had during her life and how many beyond the borders of the UK are mourning her."

On rose-leaf beds, pampering the coward heart
With feelings all too delicate for use?
Sweet is the tear that from some Howard’s eye
Drops on the cheek of one he lifts from earth:

Does it but half: he chills me while he aids,

Who sigh for Wretchedness, yet shun the Wretched,
Nursing in some delicious solitude
Their slothful loves and dainty sympathies!

Active and firm, to fight the bloodless fight
Of Science, Freedom, and the Truth in Christ.

 Rests the tir’d mind, and waking loves to dream,

The first stanza describes the cottage in the dell, the second focuses on the view from the hills nearby. The penultimate stanza deals with the Speaker’s decision to quit this idyllic setting and serve elsewhere. It is as though he feels he does not deserve this life of serenity when others fight for what they believe in. In the fourth and final stanza, he concludes that though he has quit this place it will always remain in his heart and he can access these memories in times of stress and hardship."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he can recall a summer in which the world was “dripping amber sweat.” Everything was gloriously beautiful and pleasing to the mind and body. There was nothing but “ecstasy” in the environment. The second stanza is more complicated and begins to outline the speaker's quest to prolong the summer. He is searching for answers to questions about the divine and how one is to come upon the “naiads'” sunbathed hair and remain in that moment.

This speaker could easily be Frost, especially since the poet dealt with depression in his adult life. In this poem, the speaker tells his readers that he knows the night well. It is during the night that he has taken many long walks, even when it has been raining.

The poem begins with the speaker alluding to a “truth” that humanity will eventually arrive at. As we fly, small and lonely, throughout the universe, we exhibit our worst and best characteristics. The speaker describes how humanity is capable of acts of extreme cruelty and of creating experiences of the utmost beauty. We are reaching for weapons at the same time that we are providing tender care and creating elevating artistic compositions. The speaker sees a world that will eventually come into being after humanity reaches the “brave and startling truth” of the title. It will be free of war, racism, fear, and hatred. It is one in which people live and die peacefully, children are free of the nightmares of abuse, our sons and daughters are not buried in identical unmarked graves in foreign lands, and all races are treated equally. The speaker concludes by saying that it is only when humanity realizes its full potential, that we are the true wonder of the world, that we will be capable of crafting such an existence."

This poem is told from the perspective of British infantry who was in face-to-face combat with the Mahdist forces. Throughout this piece, the speaker goes on to describe their cunningness and strategies that led them to break the square. It is not that they defeated the British forces. But, the damage they caused to the reputation of the English military was paramount. For this reason, in each stanza, the poetic voice praises them. Whatsoever, their sudden success did not lead them to victory. According to the speaker, they had won the battle but the way “fuzzy-wuzzy” fought is worth mentioning."

It is presented in two stanzas one consisting of twenty-one lines the other consisting of eleven.

The rhythm is also inconsistent, although the line lengths are similar the beats in each line alter which again adds to the sense of discord. The poem is deeply rooted in Africa.

The speaker begins this poem by asking the gods that he is given the power to “endure” the gifts he has been given by the “Muses.” This gift, although not explicitly stated, is most likely a literary one. He continues on to describe a number of instances he wants to be able to witness and depict without shying away from or weakening. These include the sight of a bird falling through the sky, as well as moments where the sky is as blue as “Minerva's eyes.” In the last section, he reiterated his previous requests and elaborates on why this is so important to him. He wishes to be able to live a life taking full advantage of the gifts he was given as well as one which is filled with love."

It is as if a scream were opened wide,
A mouth demanding everyone to listen.
Too many people cry, too many hide
And stare into themselves. I am afraid.

The only hope is visitors will come
And talk of other things than our disease …

It is as,"As we read through the very first sentence of the poem, we find the speaker describing the paintings hanging on the walls of the psychiatric hospital waiting room where the poet was admitted. The painting of Utrillo, a French painter (whose specialization was cityscapes), was hanging on the wall, while Montmartre is a large hill situated in France. With the presentation of this scene of the mental hospital sitting room, the poet may want to tell us that the mental hospitals are not as we think or imagine of them. However, on the other hand, with the presentation of paintings in the very first two lines of the poem, the poet may also want to describe the desolation of the waiting room. The poet in the following two lines says that the waiting room is itself like a “scream were opened wide” and “a mouth demanding everyone to listen,” which may mean to indicate the desperation rampant in the atmosphere of the mental hospital. Too many people cry, too many hide And stare into themselves. Besides, the poet may also be talking about the typical desperation of psychiatric illnesses, which want others to know about it and is often found vocal about it. You must have seen a number of poems who knows how to vent out their misery, but there are also people who, dissimilar to the former ones, “hide” all of their grudge and problems, remain confined to themselves, and also keep themselves 'engrossed' into themselves, without talking and sharing with anyone else around them. I am afraid. The speaker says that she is afraid. And this fear may be because of the illness she is facing, or it could also be because of the effect of the atmosphere of that mental hospital room where the speaker has been seeing misery all around since she has come here. There are no life-belts here on which to fasten. The poet further says that the mental illness is very dangerous. It may not kill a person, but it does rot him/her to such an extent that he/she wishes to die having seen the mental agony of psychiatric patients. The poet says the patients don't even have any sort of protection or life belt whereon the patients or the poet can lean and vent out her misery. So, the disease of mental illness is so dangerous and tormenting that there is no escape from it unless it is properly and regularly treated. But it still leaves its symptoms imprints. There are no life-belts here on which to fasten. (…) And talk of other things than our disease … In this extract of A Mental Hospital Sitting-Room, the poet says that the psychiatric patients are, therefore, only left with the visiting hope of their near and dear ones who keep making visits to them, and ask about their mental condition. But all this looks futile when the visitors don't talk about their illness. They just come to such a hospital to either chat or pass their time as a formality. However, it doesn't give them any mental relief, rather their mental illness becomes more devastating due to the changed attitude of their near and dear ones. So much is stagnant and yet nothing dies. The above concluding line of the poem consists of the gist of the poem and tells us what it means to be a psychiatric patient and that too in a mental hospital which is stuffed with a lot of psychiatric patients, but we must not forget here that there are many people who have benefitted through it. The poet says that the misery of mental illness is stagnant in the sense that it feeds on itself ad nothing fresh is included to it. What most trouble the poet is that a disturbed mind doesn't recover soon; rather it takes time and continues treatment. Though it is not a fatal disease, yet it may rot the person by being disintegrating and still. The speaker says: “So much is stagnant and yet nothing dies.”"

There are white roses outside the window, and inside is a dying boy who is in a great deal of pain.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that the main character is on the verge of death. He is in the water of a river and is about to drown. The man calls out to the “sisters” or the three Fates, asking them to save him. They do so, but not without forcing him to pay a terrible price. When the man emerges from the water his life resumes in reverse. He puts his clothes on backward, returns to his home, and is forced to watch his true love grow younger and younger. His life is falling apart, and there's nothing he can do about it. He can't even write poetry from beginning to end and his tears fall before he feels sadness. In the final lines of the piece, it becomes clear that this is not a one-time occurrence. The man has been granted eternal life, but only for this one specific period of time. When he reaches the end, or beginning, of his life, everything returns to the moment before he fell into the river, and it all begins again."

Where no sea runs, the waters of the heart
Push in their tides;

Firstly, the promise of faith lets the heart swell with life and strength. Secondly, it brings focus to a person's broken mind. And thirdly, it gives energy even to bones that have no flesh. Hope brings life to a lifeless body. Like light in a dark place, and water in a dry land, hopefulness brings the power to live and fight in life. Hope shines like a candle that never melts. It brings energy to the young heart. Hope drives away the seeds of old age. It brings fertility to a place of sterility. Hope lets man reach the stars and shine brightly. Faith brings hope and it rises like the morning sun in one's eyes. When it does, the blood of strength flows like a sea. Like the sun rays from the sky, hope gushes like smiles and tears without barriers. Hope comes like day to dark moon-like eyes. It brings warmth to a cold place. It chases doubts and lets promise appear in the eyes. Even when the future is hidden, and even when doubtful thoughts spread, and even when logic fails, hope appears at the tip and lets the future take shape. Hope springs through the eyes and gives strength like the sun rising over a wasteland. Thus, Dylan Thomas describes the power of hope in human life."

The sun is hiding in her room, pouring over old happier memories. She would rather not come out and face reality. The speaker has done all he can to convince her, but she refuses to listen. In the second half of the poem, the speaker describes what he has done to try to come to terms with his changed circumstances. He tells the sun that when she does return to the world and drives off the rain that things will be different than they were. She will no longer be the sole recipient of his love but be forced to share it with the “black rain” and “white hills.” "

Otters below and moor-hens on the top,

Run underground, rise in a rocky place
In Coole demesne, and there to finish up
Spread to a lake and drop into a hole.
What's water but the generated soul?

Upon the border of that lake's a wood
Now all dry sticks under a wintry sun,
And in a copse of beeches there I stood,
For Nature's pulled her tragic buskin on

At sudden thunder of the mounting swan
I turned about and looked where branches break
The glittering reaches of the flooded lake.

So atrogantly pure, a child might think
It can be murdered with a spot of ink.

From somebody that toils from chair to chair;
Beloved books that famous hands have bound,
Old marble heads, old pictures everywhere;
Great rooms where travelled men and children found
Content or joy; a last inheritor
Where none has reigned that lacked a name and fame
Or out of folly into folly came.

A spot whereon the founders lived and died
Seemed once more dear than life; ancestral trees,
Or gardens rich in memory glorified
Marriages, alliances and families,
And every bride's ambition satisfied.

Like some poor Arab tribesman and his tent.

Yeats, who is very likely the speaker in the poem, expresses his sadness over the changes he sees happening and the loss of better times, more romantic (and Romantic), times. The details in this poem are vague and specific. He references rooms, experiences, and sights that are very clear in his own mind but combined together to form a landscape of emotion for the reader to interpret."

This poem is all about what a child should not say to his or her mother on mother's day. If one doesn't want to make their mother sad, they have to follow the poet's suggestions. First of all, they have to eat the vegetables such as carrots, celery, bean, and beet. They can nag on other days. But, on mother's day, it's a must. Thereafter, they should not say that smoking is cool or they have dropped out of school. Moreover, if they have mistakenly drowned a cat, they should avoid telling their mother about that. Interestingly, if someone's mother looks fat, a child should not remind her mother about the fact. Lastly, the poet says if they want to be a poet like him, they must not say it aloud on mother's day."

In the four stanzas of 'Memorabilia', the poet describes meeting someone who met Percy Bysshe Shelley and how that experience affected him. He compares it in the third and fourth stanzas to wandering a moor and coming upon an eagle feather. It is only a small portion of a memory that isn't even his own."

And there kindles in my bosom
An emotion chill and gruesome
As I canter past the Undertaker's Horse.

But a hideously suggestive
Trot, professional and placid, he affects;
And the cadence of his hoof-beats
To my mind this grim reproof beats: --

Of pith and might and muscle -- at your heels,

You were at that last dread dak
We must cover at a walk,
Bring them back to me, O Undertaker's Horse!

And your curious way of going,
And that businesslike black crimping of your tail,
E'en with Beauty on your back, Sir,
Pacing as a lady's hack, Sir,
What wonder when I meet you I turn pale?

It may be you wait your time, Beast,
Till I write my last bad rhyme, Beast --
Quit the sunlight, cut the rhyming, drop the glass --
Follow after with the others,
Where some dusky heathen smothers
Us with marigolds in lieu of English grass.

I shall watch your plump sides hollow,
See Carnifex (gone lame) become a corse --
See old age at last o'erpower you,
And the Station Pack devour you,

In the first lines of 'The Undertaker's Horse' the speaker describes the horse, the emotions he feels when he sees it, and how no matter what he does it appears to be unavoidable. The horse is always in town, with the undertaker's children at its side. Whenever he sees it he can't help but give meaning to the sound of its hoofbeats. They call to him, or anyone, trying to suss out who will be next to meet death. As the poem progresses the speaker considers the future and the possibility that he might outlive this particular horse, or escape death in some way. This is very unlikely. He adds that no matter what he writes (such as this very poem) nothing is going to change. The horse's hooves and their rhythm are still going to be at his heels, death will continue to haunt him."

The poem begins with the speaker introducing the fact that a new day is dawning. The sunrise brings no hope to the world of the narrator, in fact, the dark is described as “crumbling” as if it has no solid structure. The days of this person's life are monotonous and dreary in the extreme. In contrast to this dark subject matter, a pinpoint of life and light arrives around the narrator's personality. A rat comes out of nowhere and jumps at the narrator's hand. He is surprised to see such a “queer” creature at this particular moment. It is at this point in the poem that the reader comes to understand that this man is an English soldier in World War I, trapped in the trenches. The rat represents an ability that the soldiers do not have. The rat is able, through its “cosmopolitan sympathies” to travel from one side to the other. It can visit the Germans and English without prejudice or fear. The speaker is deeply jealous of this ability and projects his own feelings onto the rat. He speaks aloud, stating that if the Germans knew the rat had touched an English hand or visa versa, it would surely be shot. This is not the case though and the rat, with a “grin,” is able to pass through no man's land. He continues on to describe how the rat surpasses all men in its strengths. It can complete feats that no living man could ever dream of. In the final section, he asks the rat if it is able, through its enhanced senses, to see that all these men, no matter how long they've been there and how much death they've seen, are not immune to it. They still “quake” at the sight of the battlefield. 'Break of Day in the Trenches' concludes with the narrator returning to his darkest thoughts. He imagines the image of a poppy and its melting from the arms of all the soldiers. It is a metaphor for both strength and peace, the war is draining all the good in man. The final line reveals that the speaker is keeping a little of that strength hidden away."

It chronicles the cruelty that this man had to endure and makes a reader think about how they treat people and how their actions towards those who are different could make those people feel. Thomas does a superb job of creating sympathy for the poems eponymous “hero” and in doing so really makes the reader consider what life is like for the character and by extension others that are different in some way.

Dylan Thomas combines themes of childhood, adulthood, humanity, and nature. His words describe a scenario that causes the reader to ponder why human beings are the way we are, even as young children. He points out the tendency of children to make fun of those that are different, and the tendency of adults to avoid people with differences. He also uses the man with a hunchback to reveal how people can transcend societal values to be able to live above them. The man who lives alone is able to enjoy nature to create a picture of something perfect. This suggests that the perfection of the mind is more important than bodily perfection. The speaker in The Hunchback In The Park helps the readers to value human life because of the human mind and creativity rather than physical form. The Hunchback In The Park causes the readers to question their own feelings toward other human beings, toward nature, and toward their own minds."

However, after the appearance of 'Discontent' and 'Doubt', the people of the world began to turn on themselves. Through violence and the breeding of 'fear, greed, envy, and hatred', the state of perfection was eventually destroyed by man. Yet, Harjo writes that eventually, after just one act of kindness, the world began to heal itself, escaping the horrors into a 'light' future. This restored world of balance continued down through the generations, until it reaches 'to you', the world catching up with the present date."

The poem begins with the speaker describing how the “Goldbrown” vines that were once staunchly connected to rocks have been moved away by the flood. They are floating in the water, which has come and taken what it wanted. The “flood is “sated” now but continues to rage. All this occurs while the sky looks on with “disdain.” The next lines speak to the same images. Here the speaker gives greater detail to the “ruthless” nature of the water and its ability to take anything it wants to. In the final lines, Joyce brings the text around to speak about love. Here, the speaker is asking that the listener “Uplift” their “fruits” to “love's full flood,” and perhaps embrace the complexity of experiences that comes with the emotion."

Madhubuti is about a black man who tries to look cool in American society, forgetting his actual roots. The language of this piece confuses readers. To get to the core, one has to read this piece as a series of references to a character who tries to fit in. The sketch of the character appears to be humorous as well as satiric. Madhubuti describes how the person wears imported items and acts “cool”. He is so relaxed that the poet finds it exceedingly ludicrous. At the end of this piece, he starkly contrasts his changed character with his real identity."

In 'Gathering Leaves,' Frost uses natural imagery and descriptive language to portray the themes of maturity, loss of childhood, and internal value that man places not only on himself but on everything that surrounds him. The first stanza is light-hearted and festive, aided by child-like metaphors. The second stanza is somewhat comedic, wherein the speaker seemingly makes a fool out of himself, making more noise than getting work done. The third, fourth, and fifth stanzas explore the themes of man versus both nature and himself. The final stanza is positive, wherein the speaker ultimately concludes that value should not be universally decided and that everyone has different needs and expectations."

The opening stanzas create a panoramic view of the city, spanning the mountains and coastline that surround the urban center. This serves to illustrate the scale of the poet's undertaking, as well as provide a contrast to the narrator's later musings, which become more personal. The undulating nature of the poetic gaze also mirrors the poem's preoccupation with identity, which is inevitably a composition of an individual and their environment. Finally, the poem ends with an unanswered question, which challenges the reader to assess their own conclusions about the nature of memory, legacy, and identity."

That Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn:
But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind,
So we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind. We moved as the Spirit listed. They never altered their pace,

The poem begins with the speaker stating that originally humankind was directed by a few tenets of common sense and goodness. At some point though these tenets, embodied as “copybook headings” fell to the side. They were replaced with new gods, those of “the Market Place,” or progress, growth, and wealth. Under the influence of these new gods, humanity went downhill fast. People forgot how to live their lives and the parts that make humanity human was lost. All throughout this dark period the previous way of life, as seen at the dawn of man, still existed. The rules of the copybook headings are lingering close to the human mind, ready for when they are needed. The speaker also explains why people threw off their original gods. They did not provide a magical, externally fulfilling life, something promised by the new gods. As the speaker predicted, the “Marketplace” gods do fail. Humanity is again lost without direction. This is when the “copybook headings” step in and refresh the combined consciousness of the world. Everything reverts back to how it used to be but inevitably, the cycle will start again."

In 'Self-Interrogation', the poet Emily Brontë appears to be sad while musing over her death. She can see herself standing in the evening of his life. The metaphorical night is approaching to take her away. At this critical juncture, she asks herself what he has done in her past. Is it worthwhile? The poet cannot decide either. Whenever the thought of death comes to her mind, she finds herself entangled in the “countless links”. It makes her feel that she has still a long way to go before closing her eyes. She cannot leave this battle in the middle. The poetic voice firmly declares, “But, a brave heart, with a tarnished name,/ would rather fight than rest.” It is better to be defeated by death rather than admitting submission. Challenges may come to stop her spirit, but her Christian soul knows, the “glorious morn” is waiting to welcome her in heaven. The significance of the word choice and the sustained spirit in each line of the poem will be more meaningful after listening to the poem more than once."

I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.
I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.
I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.
I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.
What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?
My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.
His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven.
His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.
His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.
His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.
His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.","I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my my","At the end of chapter four of the Song of Solomon, the woman invited the man to come to “his” “garden” and enjoy its “choicest fruits”. At the beginning of chapter five, he responds to that invitation. It is important to note that when the woman invited him to come to “his” garden, she was referring to her own sexuality. Referring to her sexuality as belonging to him shows her eager anticipation to give herself to him on her wedding night. It also shows her lifelong commitment to him. It also reaffirms what has already been implied multiple times throughout the song- namely that she has kept her virginity and is eager to give this gift to her husband at the consummation of their marriage."

The poem begins with the speaker describing the setting. She is going to be telling a story of the old west that took place among the “red, red grass”. The main character is a Spanish man named Johnny who spent his days taking care of his herd and playing his mandolin. He didn't speak to those around him, instead, he sang the “songs of Spain”. Because of his difference, and the fact that he spoke a language different than what was common, people began to think poorly of him. They said that his words were sinful if they were heard aloud. Then eventually, that he killed many people long ago. Unfortunately for Johnny, this led to his death by hanging."

For fruits that you can eat

Clinging tightly to the pit—on spears

Washed down with swigs of barrel wine that stab

The palate with pine-sharpness. They recall
The harvest and its toil,
The nets spread under silver trees that foil
The blue glass of the heavens in the fall—
Daylight packed in treasuries of oil,

Paradigmatic summers that decline
Like singular archaic nouns, the troops
Of hours in retreat. These fruits are mine—

Full of the golden past and cured in brine.","Sometimes a craving comes for salt, not sweet, For fruits that you can eat Only","'Olives' by A.E. Stallings describes how the olives taste like in different cases and why the speaker likes these “small bitter drupes.” Stallings begins this poem by describing the taste of the olives. According to the speaker of this piece, people can eat them only if the fruits are pickled in salt. She presents a variety of images that points to how the fruits are eaten. Some prefer them having them wine or vodka. While some of us eat them the brined fruit with a toothpick or serving it with other dishes. In the following stanzas, Stallings talks about their color and the emotions associated with their “humble hues”. Besides, she describes how the olives are harvested and the sunlight that packs them with the “treasuries of oil.” Lastly, she makes it clear that she likes the brined drupes which are “full of golden past.”"

It was the first gift he, presumably the poet's father, gave to the mother. Over the next lines the speaker, who is likely Boland herself, creates a detailed history of how the fan was acquired. She goes into its material properties as well as its construction. The poem concludes with a new image, that of a blackbird."

The,"'The Sun Has Burst the Sky' by Jenny Joseph it's a simple, effective poem that uses natural images to describe the intensity of one person's love. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins a series of hyperbolic images that compares their love to features in the natural world. The speaker says that because their love is so strong, the river breaks its banks, the tide disobeys the moon, ships honk their horns, and more. All throughout the poem, the speaker repeats the line “I love you,” ensuring that the intended listener, someone who is only described as “you,” never forgets how they feel."

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins by suggesting that a man can be happy if he has a few acres to care for. On one's native and, in his “own ground,” one can tend their herds and take pleasure from the simple turn of the seasons. There is fire in winter and shade in summer. As the poem progresses, the speaker emphasizes how solitude is another important part of the equation. He would rather die unknown and be buried somewhere no one could ever find him than be celebrated and attended to."

The speaker describes what parts of her memory have been lost, “what” her lips have kissed, “why” they kissed, and “where” they kissed. She continues in this way, informing the reader she cannot recall “what arms have lain / Under my head…” The rain of present-day is bringing out ghosts though, and they listen at her window, hoping she will notice and remember them, but she does not. Thus begins the sestet portion of the poem in which she is morning the loss of what she considers, “summer.” She describes herself as a winter tree that knows its branches used to be louder, more lively than they currently are but cannot remember the birds that once lived there in summer. So too has she forgotten who made her happy in the past, she only feels the void. The poem concludes sadly with no hope for the future, she says she once knew summer, but that “in me [it[ sings no more.”"

Her grandmother cares a great deal about family history and heritage, but, as the end of the first stanza reveals, she is also racist and cruel. If this poem is taken as fact, her grandmother exhibited contempt for Kay as a child when she was adopted into the family."

Wilde speaks about the love that Keats and Fanny Brawne shared in secret and how all their private words are about to be put out into the open and sold to those who care nothing for art. The merchants are going to prosper from Keats' passionate pulses.

Of deafening tunnels, brakes, innumerable bolts.

The poem takes the reader into the mind of a child who has, or so she asserts, found a way to overcome fear in her life. She repeats the refrain “Life doesn't frighten me at all” several times in these lines. It reminds the reader, and also reminds the speaker herself, what she's trying not to feel. The speaker takes the reader through many of the normal things that might scare a child and dismisses each one. It is at the end of the poem that one might start to doubt the speaker's honesty. Perhaps she is hiding a bit of the real fear she has in her heart."

It expresses Shelley's genuine and deep devotion to Jane Williams with whom he had a special kind of relationship. Jane Williams exercised a considerable influence on Shelley, and the story of their relationship makes interesting reading. In the poem, he elevates her to a high position and offers her his worship. Desmond King-Hele has the following comment to offer on this poem: “This poem is one of those anthologists” darlings so damaging to Shelley's reputation. Continual reprinting in anthologies has quite mummified it” – deadened it; taken away its life and soul – boredom is the stock response on meeting it again. The poem has a glossy finish to deter scratches, but the ill-mannered cur who does scratch finds little beneath the surface gloss. 'One Word Is Too Often Profaned' is a conceit, like most seventeenth-century love-poems, and may provoke the 'tetchy' rebuke, “More matter with less art”. What this critic means to say is that, though on the surface the poem appears to be shining and attractive, there is very little matter or meaning in it. One is inclined to agree with this judgment, because the poem is really a trifle except for the line “The desire of the moth for the star” which is often applied to Shelley's unattainable and impossible ideals."

The speaker spends the lines of this piece describing how “unfinished” we seem in a confusing world. They use abstract images that are difficult to piece together while alluding to the possibility and complexity of free will. The poet uses hieroglyphs, in the form of frees, to spell out words that make sense together when one understands the nature of humanity, but for someone exploring them for the first time, they are entirely unrelated. These hieroglyphs represent attempts at meaning that fall flat. The poem concludes with a clear statement about being from and of the earth but not understanding it."

The poem touches on the way that science, philosophers, and the religious poke, prod, and squeeze the earth, looking for some kind of reason that they all exist. The search for knowledge goes on, but the earth is never going to reveal anything. It is beyond all that. The earth is only ever going to do what it's always done—greet everyone with spring and move forward with the birth of new life and new beauty. Cummings never suggests the earth doesn't deserve to be worshiped. His tone is reverential when it comes to the planet. Instead, he's saying that no matter how much one seeks and prays, no answers are going to come. One should be contented with what plays out in nature."

The poem begins with the speaker describing the setting. Everything is black and penetrated with darkness to its core.There are paper people and trees with tall shadows. The world the speaker describes is figurative, standing in for the larger world the reader is familiar with. The leaves in this forest do not want the speaker to hurry and there is light coming from the “water flowers”. As the poem progresses the source of the light becomes clear, it is the reflection of the stars in the lake. When the speaker, who has been consumed with darkness, sees the light, she is deeply moved."

'To India – My Native Land' by Derozio presents India as a deity. In ancient times, she was as beautiful as a goddess. The poet says, “A beauteous halo circled round thy brow”. When the poet was writing this poem, India was suffering from British domination. The poet could neither visualize the “glory” of her past nor her “reverence”. Like a chained eagle, she was grounded. In such a condition, the poet tried to compose this verse as a piece of consolation to her groveling motherland. He wished to recollect her lost glory and celebrate it through his poem."

Walcott beautifully presents how he revisits the past. This poem begins in a metaphorical manner. The poet Walcott comparing him to a snake depicts how he looks back on his childhood days. He goes on to present various imagery to paint a picture of his childhood home. The description provides a hint to the financial state of those who lived in that area including the poet's family as well. Walcott mainly describes how they listened to his mother's stories in the evening by gathering around the lamplight. Those memories still make him nostalgic, a little bit sad too."

Here the poet metaphorically compares his love to a Lilac flower and a red rose. 'O Were My Love Yon Lilac Fair' by Robert Burns presents the poet's desire to be a bird if his love is as fair as the purple Lilac flower. Then he will find a cozy nest in its bosom when wearied. Furthermore, he will sing wanton songs to the flower throughout the youthful May. In the next stanza, the poet wishes to be a drop of dew if his love is like a red rose. He will rest in its beautiful breast and feast on the beauty of the night. The poet will wait there till the sun rises in the morning and fade away thereafter."

In the first lines of this piece, the speaker begins by giving the reader a number of impossible tasks. These include catching a “falling star” and teaching him how to “hear mermaids singing.” It is not until the second stanza that one comes to realize that Donne is comparing these impossibilities to the locating of a beautiful and faithful woman. He believes that one is just as likely to figure how why the devil's foot is cleft as find a woman who has both of these traits. The speaker goes on to tell the listener that if one were to venture into the strange unknown, they would come across endless wonders, but not a woman who would please him in totality. In the last stanza, he explains how if he thought that such a woman did exist that he's suffered to find her. He'd go on a pilgrimage and do anything he had to. The speaker does not believe it is really possible though. In fact, he states that one might think they've found a woman of his liking but she would eventually turn out to be “False.”"

The poem begins with a request from the poet to play a note that could trigger a state of falsehood in the minds of listeners. In order to set the scene, Larkin introduces the images from a New Orleans concert hall where people gathered to listen to his music. Bechet, in his familiar style, is seen to set the scene and make people go about in the way they want. There are references to Storyville, a red-light district in New Orleans active during the early 20th century; the sporting-house girls thronging the place to get the highest bid of the night; scholars failed to fulfill their dream in music. By zooming out, Larkin expresses his heart's delight while listening to Bechet's “natural noise of good” even from a distant English shore."

The screw,"Oily Weather' by Ernest Hemingway is an image-rich poem in which the speaker uses the sea to allude to lust and desire. In the first lines of the poem, Hemingway depicts the sea as something that lusts after the hulls of ships. This is its singular pursuit, and in its churning and swelling, it tries to latch onto them. On the other hand, the ships, even though they're throbbing, spurn the sea as an old and uninteresting lover they want to avoid. The poem ends without a specific conclusion. The reader is left to consider this dynamic and the fact that it's likely going to go on for the rest of time."
1039,1050,1050,"‘They flash upon that inward eye
which is the bliss of solitude’
(from ‘The Daffodils’ by William Wordsworth)

An afternoon yellow and open-mouthed
with daffodils. The sun treads the path
among cedars and enormous oaks.
It might be a country house, guests strolling,
the rumps of gardeners between nursery shrubs.

I am reading poetry to the insane.
An old woman, interrupting, offers
as many buckets of coal as I need.
A beautiful chestnut-haired boy listens
entirely absorbed. A schizophrenic

on a good day, they tell me later.
In a cage of first March sun a woman
sits not listening, not feeling.
In her neat clothes the woman is absent.
A big, mild man is tenderly led

to his chair. He has never spoken.
His labourer’s hands on his knees, he rocks
gently to the rhythms of the poems.
I read to their presences, absences,
to the big, dumb labouring man as he rocks.

He is suddenly standing, silently,
huge and mild, but I feel afraid. Like slow
movement of spring water or the first bird
of the year in the breaking darkness,
the labourer’s voice recites ‘The Daffodils’.

The nurses are frozen, alert; the patients
seem to listen. He is hoarse but word-perfect.
Outside the daffodils are still as wax,
a thousand, ten thousand, their syllables
unspoken, their creams and yellows still.

Forty years ago, in a Valleys school,
the class recited poetry by rote.
Since the dumbness of misery fell

of speech and that once he had something to say.

When he’s done, before the applause, we observe
the flowers’ silence. A thrush sings
and the daffodils are flame.","The daffodils are a syllable of silence,","‘Miracle on St. David’s Day’ by Gillian Clarke, as has been stated by Clarke herself, is based on her own personal experience about a man who had not “spoken” for years, but overcame that ailment during one of her poetry readings due to his recollection of a childhood memory. Through metaphor and blunt language—natural comparisons and contrasts that express hardship as well as comradery—Clarke manages to express that story in a way that tugs at the heart and reveals the triumph of the “mild man” with the ailment in great, moving detail. Essentially, this is a poem about the beauty of human perseverance, and a heartwarming tale about this “mild man” who remembers he could speak, and Clarke has done well in pairing the natural elements to both represent his suffering over the years and to reveal the greatness of his victory over his ailment. From beginning to end then, ‘Miracle on St. David’s Day’ is set up to reveal his story to its fullest, and the result is a beautiful tale of overcoming demanding odds with the right incentive."

The poet-narrator, while plunged deep into the nadir of misery, received the grace of a proud man, who showed him only a nonchalant charity. The narrator paid back his grace and thanked him on the first chance he could get. In a similar situation, when the narrator was in abject penury and hardship, accompanied with mental agony and affliction, a poor man played the Good Samaritan for him, nursing his bruised body and bruised heart. The poet-narrator felt that this time he could not pay back the benevolence. The sympathy he got was invaluable and cannot be returned."

No matter what went before, the dawn of a new day is a chance to start over again. It is a rebirth, a chance for the happy to continue in that vein and for the sad to find that spring of happiness."

In the first lines of 'Outside History,' the speaker begins by discussing stars and the way their light, or dark, reaches the earth. She moves to discuss human mortality and history. The stars are outside the human understanding, in a place beyond our history. At the same time, she makes oblique references to the place of women in the historical record and how their accomplishments and lives have been erased. Partway through the text, she makes the choice to step outside of this pattern and try to forge a path in which she, or women in general, are not consumed by primarily male documentation of the past and present. At the same time, as the poem concludes, she speaks on physical death and darkness that is only now reaching her from the past. In the last lines, she discusses how impossible it is for a human being to step into the past and comfort those who have been overcome by this physical death."

The poem begins with the speaker describing how there is a willow tree sitting on the bank of the river. He says that the tree is always there, and is always a willow. It has lasted through springs, summers, and falls. It has now made it all the way to another winter. Due to the way the tree lives, and its perseverance and resistance to being “bitten by the sun,” it has taken no notice of the fact that winter has finally come. Eventually, the cold catches up with the leaves and they begin to pale and fall off the tree into the river below. The waters catch the leaves and sweep them off along with the tide. The tree was able to live out its entire life cycle without concern, worry, or despair for the coming days. Now it has finally, although with loathing, shed its leaves and started on its way to a new life in spring. Read more poems from William Carlos Williams."

Even though the time is disheartening, he hopes that he can protect his son with son despite all prevailing evils. 'A Prayer For My Son' expresses the anxiety of a parent who wants to protect his child. Yeats seeks the help of a Ghost to keep his son, Michael, away from the evil of the world. He says that the Ghost should stand by the cradle of the baby and keep him safe always. He also hopes that if his son gets a night of better sleep, his wife also could get some rest during the night. Yeats also adds that the Ghost should have a sword in its fists to ward off evil people who might attempt to end the young Michael's life. Yeats then expresses his discontent at God and mocks that God might be everywhere and might have power all over the world, but he cannot speak and express what he wants. When concluding, he speaks of how powerful human love is and the willpower to protect one's kind. Therefore, even if God's enemies attempt to rampage the Earth, humans will fight it with their love for one another."

He is in a very bad state but no one does anything substantive to assist.

sized up, written down as hope
or prophecy, probability or doubt.


Her charts are held on laptops,
mastered by medics, laid bare.
Her peaks and gorges, fell slopes,

oceans, woodlands, stars,
this atlas of hers is no mystic book,
it is a textbook of disease.

The sun turns dust to smoke,
and picks out, as it sets,
a path your hands might take

– your roving hands – she lets
them roam, though she’s no landowner.
By law, her breast’s

curve has a patent, so you know
that bankers – tired of gold –
have bought a piece of her and you.

You call her your America – too right.

have been carved up into real estate,

ranches ringed with barbed wire,
lights and guns. KEEP OUT

which drapes in blossom as the light dies.

The poem begins with the speaker mimicking the lines of John Donne, to whom this poem is dedicated. Donne's piece, 'To His Mistress Going to Bed' is parodied as the speaker takes all the romance away from sexual encounters. He makes clear that this woman whose body was so well elevated and praised by Donne in a great number of his works has now been broken down and sold off to the highest bidder. Roberts develops a metaphor comparing humanity to land that has been mapped and then sold. No one truly owns their body anymore. This depressing thought is finally alleviated towards the end of the poem when the speaker comes to the conclusion that humanity's connection to one another and to nature is much more important than any scientific data."

This gives the poem a bleak undertone. It is presented in seven stanzas of varying length.

The poet tells his student to first of all take a poem as it is. They have nothing to look elsewhere. A poem is a world in itself. There are sound, visuals, colors, complexity, simplicity, everything. A reader has to be concerned about the senses. Poetry generally demands an association of seeing, smelling, feeling, and last but not least it also gives enjoyment. The poet says, “I want them to waterski/ across the surface of the poem”. This line presents the essence of the poem. However, in the end, the poet feels dejected about the attitude of readers to poetry. They somehow want a meaning, no matter if it has one or not. "

Bitter springs of truth.
From sand unslakèd
Twisted strong cords,
And wandered naked
Among trysted swords.
There’s a word unspoken,
A knot untied.
Whatever is broken
The earth may hide.
The road was jagged
Over sharp stones:
Your body’s too ragged
To cover your bones.
The wind scatters
Tears upon dust;
Your soul’s in tatters
Where the spears thrust.
Your race is ended—
See, it is run:
Nothing is mended
Under the sun.
Straight as an arrow
You fall to a sleep
Not too narrow
And not too deep.","For this you’ve striven Daring, to fail: Your sky is riven","'Fire and Sleet and Candlelight' by Elinor Wylie is a short poem through which an impassioned narrator speaks about a wasted life. The poem begins with the narrator dismissing the work that this listener has done. It is only “For this” that you have “striven.” The bitter truth has been the only outcome divined from “you” tearing yourself apart like a “veil.” The listener of this piece has dedicated their life to a pursuit that has taken him/her away from the pleasures of life, particularly youth. The narrator thinks that this has been a mistake, the listener has wasted away until their skin can barely hide their bones. The listener has metaphorically, dragged his/herself along a “jagged road.” It becomes clear at the end of the poem that the listener's life has come to a close. It is the end, and nothing has been resolved in either of the character's lives or revealed to the readers of 'Fire and Sleet and Candlelight'. It remains an unknown what the relationship is between the two, or what exactly the listener spent their life doing that the speaker considers unworthy of them."

Lewis moves through situations in which her lover made her feel bad, exploring manipulation, power dynamics and emotional abuse. The focus on pronoun within the poem always syntactically places 'You' before 'me', signaling Lewis' own subconscious mentality, putting the happiness of her lover before her own. Around halfway through the poem, Lewis moves to how she feels guilty for this relationship, still clinging on even though it is bad for her. The final two lines focus on possession, Lewis realizing that her lower knows that he 'owns me'."
1052,1063,1063,"The bell-rope that gathers God at dawn
Dispatches me as though I dropped down the knell
Of a spent day - to wander the cathedral lawn
From pit to crucifix, feet chill on steps from hell.

Have you not heard, have you not seen that corps
Of shadows in the tower, whose shoulders sway
Antiphonal carillons launched before
The stars are caught and hived in the sun's ray?

The bells, I say, the bells break down their tower;
And swing I know not where. Their tongues engrave
Membrane through marrow, my long-scattered score
Of broken intervals… And I, their sexton slave!

Oval encyclicals in canyons heaping
The impasse high with choir. Banked voices slain!
Pagodas, campaniles with reveilles out leaping-
O terraced echoes prostrate on the plain!…

And so it was I entered the broken world
To trace the visionary company of love, its voice
An instant in the wind (I know not whither hurled)
But not for long to hold each desperate choice.

My word I poured. But was it cognate, scored
Of that tribunal monarch of the air
Whose thigh embronzes earth, strikes crystal Word
In wounds pledged once to hope - cleft to despair?

The steep encroachments of my blood left me
No answer (could blood hold such a lofty tower
As flings the question true?) -or is it she
Whose sweet mortality stirs latent power?-

And through whose pulse I hear, counting the strokes
My veins recall and add, revived and sure
The angelus of wars my chest evokes:
What I hold healed, original now, and pure…

And builds, within, a tower that is not stone
(Not stone can jacket heaven) - but slip
Of pebbles, - visible wings of silence sown
In azure circles, widening as they dip

The matrix of the heart, lift down the eye
That shrines the quiet lake and swells a tower…
The commodious, tall decorum of that sky
Unseals her earth, and lifts love in its shower.",The bell-rope that gathers God at dawn Dispatches me as though I droppe,"'The Broken Tower' by Hart Crane describes one speaker's transcendent quest to attain some measure of success and the frustrations he faces along the way. The poem begins with the speaker describing his descent from a tower. This tower immediately comes to represent his mind. It is not a pleasant place to be. He describes the tower as having bells that tell him when and where to go. It is located on the grounds of a cathedral which is hell to walk around. These first lines make it clear he is unhappy with his current situation. The next stanzas pose a question and answer. Crane's speaker is wondering if the work he has made up in the tower of his mind is worth anything at all. He's afraid his art, likely writing, has no merit. As the poem progresses he questions his creativity and wonders if there is anything divine in his work. Towards the end of 'The Broken Tower', the speaker introduces his muse into the poem. He has descended from the tower in an effort to find love This force, and the person with whom he finds it, inspires him. He is able to move beyond his painful doubts and construct a new tower. The speaker's new tower is healthier, quieter, and located near a lake. The new construction is so welcome, the sky showers love down upon it. These final lines return the speaker to a better place mentally. He is able to relax into a different pattern of thought."
1053,1064,1064,"Today the children begin to hope for snow and look in the sky for auguries of it.

It is not for such omens that we wait.

And even if the snow comes down indeed,

we shall still stand behind a pane of glass untouched by it,

and watch the children press their image on the drifts the snow has laid

upon a winter they think they have made.

This is a wise illusion. Better to believe the near world is created by

a wish, a shaping hand, a certain eye,

than hide in the mind’s corner as we do,

as though there were no world, no fall of snow.",The children begin to hope for snow and look in the sky for auguries of it.,"In 'Poem in Winter,' the poet Elizabeth Jennings uses the winter season as a symbol of children's hopes as they look for “auguries.” Jennings describes this season with very simple language, and we readily know what exactly she is trying to say. Even the title of the poem is very appropriate as it says what the poet wants to convey through this poem. However, it is noteworthy that Jennings has also used the winter season and snow to express her sorrows. In most of her poems, you will find her symbolizing winter as cold as sorrow, which doesn't leave her. The season of winter and frozen snow has always appeared to her like the sorrows and sadness she experienced in her life."

Blowing like a leaf in green shadow. Down the ravine behind the empty house, The cowbells follow one another Into the distances of the afternoon. To my right,

I lean back, as the evening darkens and comes on. A chicken hawk floats over, looking for home.
I have wasted my life.","Over my head, I see the bronze butterfly, Asleep on the black trunk,","'Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy's Farm in Pine Island, Minnesota' by James Wright is a beautiful poem that includes a speaker's thoughts about a farm. The speaker uses thoughtful and entrancing language to describe farmland they're visiting. They are resting in a hammock, looking around them, and describing everything they see. This includes a butterfly, the way the sun lights the ground, cowbells, a chicken hawk, and more. These beautiful images make the speaker think that however they've previously been living their life—it's been wrong. A life in the country, surrounded by beautiful natural sights and sounds is how they should've been living all along."

The poem begins with the speaker telling the reader that they are wrong about life or earth. Anyone who thinks they have killed or died does not understand how Brahma, the god of creation, works. He also explains how subtle he is in his movements and that he can pass through the world and come back again effortlessly. In the second stanza, Brahma presents a series of contrasting images that speak to the way he sees the world. Light and dark are the same, as are fame and shame. He can see into the spirit world and know where all the vanished gods are. Brahma emphasizes how important he should be to worshipers. If one does not adequately appreciate him, they will only have cause to regret it. He concludes by asking the reader to give up worrying about heaven and instead devote their time to him."
1056,1067,1067,"My dear Telemachus,
The Trojan War is over now; I don't recall who won it. The Greeks, no doubt, for only they would leave
so many dead so far from their own homeland. But still, my homeward way has proved too long. While we were wasting time there, old Poseidon, it almost seems, stretched and extended space.
I don't know where I am or what this place can be. It would appear some filthy island, with bushes, buildings, and great grunting pigs. A garden choked with weeds; some queen or other. Grass and huge stones . . . Telemachus, my son! To a wanderer the faces of all islands resemble one another. And the mind trips, numbering waves; eyes, sore from sea horizons, run; and the flesh of water stuffs the ears. I can't remember how the war came out; even how old you are--I can't remember.
Grow up, then, my Telemachus, grow strong. Only the gods know if we'll see each other again. You've long since ceased to be that babe before whom I reined in the plowing bullocks. Had it not been for Palamedes' trick we two would still be living in one household. But maybe he was right; away from me you are quite safe from all Oedipal passions, and your dreams, my Telemachus, are blameless.",The Trojan War is over now; I don't recall who won it. The Greeks,"'Odysseus to Telemachus' by Joseph Brodsky is told from the perspective of the epic hero, Odysseus while he is stranded on Circe's island. The poem begins with Odysseus stating that the Trojan War is over, but that he does not know, or remember, who won it. It seems to be so far in the past, and so unimportant the victor is irrelevant. All the same, he speculates it was the Greeks, due to the sheer number of dead men left behind. The sea on which Odysseus now travels “almost seems' to have been stretched out by the god Poseidon. It has taken Odysseus many years to get as far as he has and he is not yet home. The poem continues, providing some hint about which part of the journey Odysseus is currently involved in. It becomes clear that he is on Circe's island surrounded by his crew who have been turned into pigs. In the next lines of the piece, Odysseus speaks of his true inner turmoil, an emotional side of the character that is never revealed in “The Odyssey.” He is desperate to return home but knows that he will probably never get there. Odysseus wishes his son well, figuring that they will never meet again. He remembers the time before the war when he attempted to escape his participation and the foiling of that plan. If only it had worked, he could have stayed with his son. In the last lines Odysseus tries to find a silver lining in the horrors he's experienced, the fact that his son has been able to grow up and into his own man."
1057,1068,1068,"The first time I walked
With a girl, I was twelve,
Cold, and weighted down
With two oranges in my jacket.
December. Frost cracking
Beneath my steps, my breath
Before me, then gone,
As I walked toward
Her house, the one whose
Porch light burned yellow
Night and day, in any weather.
A dog barked at me, until
She came out pulling
At her gloves, face bright
With rouge. I smiled,
Touched her shoulder, and led
Her down the street, across
A used car lot and a line
Of newly planted trees,
Until we were breathing
Before a drugstore. We
Entered, the tiny bell
Bringing a saleslady
Down a narrow aisle of goods.
I turned to the candies
Tiered like bleachers,
And asked what she wanted -
Light in her eyes, a smile
Starting at the corners
Of her mouth. I fingered
A nickle in my pocket,
And when she lifted a chocolate
That cost a dime,
I didn't say anything.
I took the nickle from
My pocket, then an orange,
And set them quietly on
The counter. When I looked up,
The lady's eyes met mine,
And held them, knowing
Very well what it was all
About.
Outside,
A few cars hissing past,
Fog hanging like old
Coats between the trees.
I took my girl's hand
In mine for two blocks,
Then released it to let
Her unwrap the chocolate.
I peeled my orange
That was so bright against
The gray of December
That, from some distance,
Someone might have thought
I was making a fire in my hands.","I was twelve, cold, and weighted down with two oranges in my jacket.","Oranges 'Oranges' by Gary Soto is a thoughtful poem that details a young boy's first date to a drugstore and his purchase of chocolate. The poem is written in a narrative format. It follows the young boy from his walk to the girl's house, to the drugstore, and outside again. The events are quite easy to follow due to Soto's use of diction and syntax. The poem describes the young boy's nerves, excitement and embarrassment over not being able to pay for the chocolate that his young date selected. But, luckily for him, the cashier accepted his nickel and his orange as payment. The poem ends with a reemphasis on the warmth that has been carried throughout the two stanzas."

This poem begins with winter dawn and how it appears during the coldest phase of the season. The speaker of the poem describes the “night” as a predator which leaves the remnants of its kills behind that, including “Twig-bones,” “ice feathers,” and the “ghost of starlight.” Then she goes on to describe how the ambiance is hostile to every living creature. Beginning with a rose that has been stunted in its nip to the underground water table stiffened like stones, everything around resonates with the lifeless tune of chilling winter wind. Yet, in the end, the speaker finds one leaf that somehow manages to raise itself from the snow cover against the light of hope."

The speaker describes throughout the nine lines of this short poem how no matter what the listener, his beloved, does to him, he's going to continue to love him. Sever his arms, he will hold this person with his heart. Blind him, cut out his tongue, or “smash” his ears, he will still see them and conquer them when he wants to. This person is so tied to him that they are in his bloodstream."

And makes my old wounds bleed anew.

And in his tainted blood the fire.

The vow I made to love you, too.","It is not that I love you less Than when before your feet I lay, But to prevent","The Self Banished Edmund Waller has made a promise to his love that he will stay away from her, as to not hurt them both. In keeping this promise, he laments the pain and frustration that staying away causes him. Yet, he knows that he must keep his promise to stay away, because if he breaks that, she might also think the promise to 'love' her can be broken just as easily. The poem touches on themes of failed love, and love's woes."
1061,1072,1072,"Twice or thrice had I lov'd thee,
Before I knew thy face or name;
So in a voice, so in a shapeless flame
Angels affect us oft, and worshipp'd be;
Still when, to where thou wert, I came,
Some lovely glorious nothing I did see.
But since my soul, whose child love is,
Takes limbs of flesh, and else could nothing do,
More subtle than the parent is
Love must not be, but take a body too;
And therefore what thou wert, and who,
I bid Love ask, and now
That it assume thy body, I allow,
And fix itself in thy lip, eye, and brow.
Whilst thus to ballast love I thought,
And so more steadily to have gone,
With wares which would sink admiration,
I saw I had love's pinnace overfraught;
Ev'ry thy hair for love to work upon
Is much too much, some fitter must be sought;
For, nor in nothing, nor in things

Then, as an angel, face, and wings
Of air, not pure as it, yet pure, doth wear,

'Twixt women's love, and men's, will ever be.","I lov'd thee, before I knew thy face or name; So","Air and Angels' by John Donne tell of a speaker's search for the location of his love as he seeks out a relationship with the listener. The poem begins with the speaker describing how he has loved the listener many times over, and always without knowing her. His love exists on its own terms, separate from the person it is directed at. The speaker compares love to the purity of angels. It is in the world the same way angels move through the air. He wonders over how exactly his love will be made known. First, considering the possibility it could find a home within his lover's body. This is quickly pushed to the side though as he decides a woman could not balance the strength of a man's love within her. She would be weighed down like a small ship. 'Air and Angels' concludes with the speaker deciding the only way his love and his listener's love can come together is if her's encircles his like a sphere. This way they avoid anything too “bright” or “extreme.” Their loves will reside in a middle ground together."

The poem begins with the speaker waking from a dream and feeling the peace of the moment in which he is in. He has been dreaming of his “Sweet,” who the reader will come to discover later in the poem, may not return his feelings. He jumps to his feet and a spirit leads him to “thy chamber window, Sweet!” He now stands before the window of her bedroom and describes how all the beauty that the world has to offer, “The wandering airs,” the “silent streams,” and the “Champak” magnolia trees cannot satisfy him. He believes it is his fate, if she does not give in to him, to die upon her heart. The final stanza of the piece brings the speaker closer to such a death. He has collapsed on the grass and is begging his “belovèd” to let him in and rain down “kisses” upon his “pale…cold” cheeks. He needs an infusion of life. “Alas,” he states, this does not happen and makes one last plea for her affection as he asks for her to once more place her heart upon his. If she does not, he fears that it will finally break."

In the first stanzas of the poem, Clare's speaker, who is often considered to be Clare himself, speaks about the darkest parts of his life. He's alive and present in his life, but he feels as though no one knows him or understands him. He's spoken about with scorn and “noise,” and his woes come and go frantically through his mind. He's haunted by them and by the fact that those who were once the closest to him in his life are “strange.” The final stanza provides what the speaker sees as the only possible solution to his woes, to enter into the next life, where he'll live alongside God in Heaven. There, he'll finally get to sleep as he did as a child."

It does me no good; violence has changed me.
My body has grown cold like the stripped fields;
now there is only my mind, cautious and wary,
with the sense it is being tested.
Once more, the sun rises as it rose in summer;
bounty, balm after violence.
Balm after the leaves have changed, after the fields
have been harvested and turned.
Tell me this is the future,
I won’t believe you.
Tell me I’m living,
I won’t believe you.

Snow had fallen. I remember
music from an open window.
Come to me, said the world.
This is not to say
it spoke in exact sentences
but that I perceived beauty in this manner.
Sunrise. A film of moisture
on each living thing. Pools of cold light
formed in the gutters.
I stood
at the doorway,
ridiculous as it now seems.
What others found in art,
I found in nature. What others found
in human love, I found in nature.
Very simple. But there was no voice there.
Winter was over. In the thawed dirt,
bits of green were showing.
Come to me, said the world. I was standing
in my wool coat at a kind of bright portal—
I can finally say
long ago; it gives me considerable pleasure. Beauty
the healer, the teacher—
death cannot harm me
more than you have harmed me,
my beloved life.

The light has changed;
middle C is tuned darker now.
And the songs of morning sound over-rehearsed. 
This is the light of autumn, not the light of spring.
The light of autumn: you will not be spared.
The songs have changed; the unspeakable
has entered them.
This is the light of autumn, not the light that says
I am reborn.
Not the spring dawn: I strained, I suffered, I was delivered.
This is the present, an allegory of waste.
So much has changed. And still, you are fortunate:
the ideal burns in you like a fever.
Or not like a fever, like a second heart.
The songs have changed, but really they are still quite beautiful.
They have been concentrated in a smaller space, the space of the mind.
They are dark, now, with desolation and anguish.
And yet the notes recur. They hover oddly
in anticipation of silence.
The ear gets used to them.
The eye gets used to disappearances.
You will not be spared, nor will what you love be spared.
A wind has come and gone, taking apart the mind;
it has left in its wake a strange lucidity.
How privileged you are, to be passionately
clinging to what you love;
the forfeit of hope has not destroyed you.
Maestoso, doloroso:
This is the light of autumn; it has turned on us.
Surely it is a privilege to approach the end
still believing in something.
 
5.
It is true there is not enough beauty in the world.
It is also true that I am not competent to restore it.
Neither is there candor, and here I may be of some use.
I am
at work, though I am silent.
The bland
misery of the world
bounds us on either side, an alley
lined with trees; we are
companions here, not speaking,
each with his own thoughts;
behind the trees, iron
gates of the private houses,
the shuttered rooms
somehow deserted, abandoned,
as though it were the artist’s
duty to create
hope, but out of what? what?
the word itself
false, a device to refute
perception— At the intersection,
ornamental lights of the season.
I was young here. Riding
the subway with my small book
as though to defend myself against
the same world:
you are not alone,
the poem said,
in the dark tunnel.
 
6.
The brightness of the day becomes
the brightness of the night;
the fire becomes the mirror.
My friend the earth is bitter; I think
sunlight has failed her.
Bitter or weary, it is hard to say.
Between herself and the sun,
something has ended.
She wants, now, to be left alone;
I think we must give up
turning to her for affirmation.
Above the fields,
above the roofs of the village houses,
the brilliance that made all life possible
becomes the cold stars.
Lie still and watch:
they give nothing but ask nothing.
From within the earth’s
bitter disgrace, coldness and barrenness
my friend the moon rises:
she is beautiful tonight, but when is she not beautiful?"," The light of autumn, not the light of spring, is a gift to us.</s","October' by Louise Glück muses on the natural change in October and the poet's personal thoughts about autumn. 'October' by Louise Glück is a poem about the autumn season. It is the season that brings a change in nature. In the poem, the poet thinks it to be the winter again. To verify the seasonal change she looks around her and starts to question herself. While describing the natural change, she also talks about the painful episodes of her past. In autumn, nature rejuvenates herself from the cold grips of winter. Like nature, she also feels the change in herself. The vines in the back garden especially catch the poet's attention. The vine has climbed the “south wall” without anyone's help. The poet implicitly compares herself with the vine. It seems that she has also grown strong like the vine without anyone's help."
1067,1078,1078,"‘A cold coming we had of it,
Just the worst time of the year
For a journey, and such a long journey:
The ways deep and the weather sharp,
The very dead of winter.’
And the camels galled, sore-footed, refractory,
Lying down in the melting snow.
There were times we regretted
The summer palaces on slopes, the terraces,
And the silken girls bringing sherbet.
Then the camel men cursing and grumbling
And running away, and wanting their liquor and women,
And the night-fires going out, and the lack of shelters,
And the cities hostile and the towns unfriendly
And the villages dirty and charging high prices:
A hard time we had of it.
At the end we preferred to travel all night,
Sleeping in snatches,
With the voices singing in our ears, saying
That this was all folly.
Then at dawn we came down to a temperate valley,
Wet, below the snow line, smelling of vegetation;
With a running stream and a water-mill beating the darkness,
And three trees on the low sky,
And an old white horse galloped away in the meadow.
Then we came to a tavern with vine-leaves over the lintel,
Six hands at an open door dicing for pieces of silver,
And feet kicking the empty wine-skins,
But there was no information, and so we continued
And arrived at evening, not a moment too soon
Finding the place; it was (you may say) satisfactory.
All this was a long time ago, I remember,
And I would do it again, but set down
This set down
This: were we led all that way for
Birth or Death? There was a Birth, certainly,
We had evidence and no doubt. I had seen birth and death,
But had thought they were different; this Birth was
Hard and bitter agony for us, like Death, our death.
We returned to our places, these Kingdoms,
But no longer at ease here, in the old dispensation,
With an alien people clutching their gods.
I should be glad of another death.","The camels galled, sore-footed, refractory,","Journey of the Magi' by T.S. Eliot describes the terrible conditions through which the Magi traversed to meet the Christ child after his birth. The poem begins with the speaker listing out all of the troubles he and his men faced on their way to the manger in which Christ was born. The weather was freezing and there was hardly any food or shelter. Every time they came to a town they were turned away. Even the camels were suffering. In the second stanza, the men get to where they were going and find it to be simply, “satisfactory.” The manager has no great presence but that doesn't mean the experience wasn't important. The true impact of the journey and meeting comes after the men have returned home. They are no longer the people they were before they set off. The speaker states that he longs for a second death through which he is able to join God."
1068,1079,1079,"It was an April morning: fresh and clear
The Rivulet, delighting in its strength,
Ran with a young man's speed; and yet the voice
Of waters which the winter had supplied
Was softened down into a vernal tone.
The spirit of enjoyment and desire,
And hopes and wishes, from all living things
Went circling, like a multitude of sounds.
The budding groves seemed eager to urge on
The steps of June; as if their various hues
Were only hindrances that stood between
Them and their object: but, meanwhile, prevailed
Such an entire contentment in the air
That every naked ash, and tardy tree
Yet leafless, showed as if the countenance
With which it looked on this delightful day
Were native to the summer.--Up the brook
I roamed in the confusion of my heart,
Alive to all things and forgetting all.
At length I to a sudden turning came
In this continuous glen, where down a rock
The Stream, so ardent in its course before,
Sent forth such sallies of glad sound, that all
Which I till then had heard, appeared the voice
Of common pleasure: beast and bird, the lamb,
The shepherd's dog, the linnet and the thrush
Vied with this waterfall, and made a song,
Which, while I listened, seemed like the wild growth
Or like some natural produce of the air,
That could not cease to be. Green leaves were here;
But 'twas the foliage of the rocks--the birch,
The yew, the holly, and the bright green thorn,
With hanging islands of resplendent furze:
And, on a summit, distant a short space,
By any who should look beyond the dell,
A single mountain-cottage might be seen.
I gazed and gazed, and to myself I said,
'Our thoughts at least are ours; and this wild nook,
My EMMA, I will dedicate to thee.'
----Soon did the spot become my other home,
My dwelling, and my out-of-doors abode.
And, of the Shepherds who have seen me there,
To whom I sometimes in our idle talk
Have told this fancy, two or three, perhaps,
Years after we are gone and in our graves,
When they have cause to speak of this wild place,
May call it by the name of EMMA'S DELL.","The Rivulet, delighting in its strength, Ran with a young man'","'It Was an April Morning: Fresh and Clear' by William Wordsworth focuses on Emma's Dell, an area that Wordsworth called his “second home.” The poet spends the lines of the poem exploring the various elements around an extraordinary river. It runs through the woods, surrounded by trees of all different varieties. Their leaves, colors, and shapes help make up the visual landscape of the poem. The poet uses personification, metaphors, and imagery to paint a clear picture of the river's sound, the music it makes with the other elements of the woods, and his attachment to the area."

At the beginning of 'Power', Adrienne Rich refers to human history as it is the source of inspiration to her. She uses the imagery of a backhoe excavating a bottle of amber in the upcoming section of the poem. In folk medicine, there are various uses of amber in health-related problems. There is a belief that it has some medicinal properties. Here Adrienne uses “amber” as a symbol. The next section of the poem makes it clear. In the next section of the poem, the poetess reveals for whom she is writing this poem. The person is none other than the well-known scientist, Marie Curie. Rich was reading about her before penning down her thoughts regarding her mental power. At first, she points out the decaying physique of Curie caused by extensive experimentation with radioactive elements. The description is no doubt pathetic and heart-wrenching. In the penultimate section of the poem, Rich presents her resolution in the manner of a sonnet. In her words, Curie died like a soul constantly denying her mortal “wounds”. At last, the poetess says that Curie got her power from the “same source” from which a man also gets his power."

This group is depicted by the speaker as a tiger and is completely ignored, partly out of ignorance and part fear, by the ruling party. The government of the time was added to the poem through the image of an elephant. The poem concludes with a depiction of the chaos caused by the terrorists and the fact that no one is doing anything to stop it. In fact, groups are actively trying to ignore the threat and get the citizens of Sri Lank to do the same."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that women were made for men. Their job is to charm and “Be not afraid” of their partners. It doesn’t matter what the man does, the woman must maintain her womanliness. The speaker does not deny that women are strong, but that strength needs to be hidden behind layers of meekness. This, she thinks, is the proper way to act. The poem concludes with the speaker comparing women to Christ. They are just as hopeful and representative of good as he is."

How expensive they are as well!

Due to this, there is lots of press and interviews around the poet which allows for routes of access into his poetry. Betjeman was recorded talking about the poem, stating that it is about 'a lady I see but have never spoken to, in a London church.' This church can be assumed to be Grosvenor Chapel in Mayfair, which is where Betjeman frequently worshipped. An interview with the Sunday Express gives us further insight into the poem, “She was the most beautiful creature… And I didn't even know her name – but it was probably all the better for that. She might have been terrible.” This quotation furthers the idea generated within the poem that Betjeman is enthused by the mystery of the woman, taking pleasure in the fact she is anonymous."

These are colorful in his memory, like the fruit. There is an implicit comparison to where he lives now, New York. The poem concludes when the speaker is filled with homesickness and describes how he had to look away. His body was starving for his home, bringing him to tears."

And winds and waves are softly sighing,
While leafy trees make low replying;
Though voices clear in joyous strain

Though rising suns their radiance throw

The poem begins with the speaker stating the fact that even though she loves the “path” she has been walking on, she will never “pass” that way again. She is leaving behind the floral smells, singing birds, and the gentle wind and waves. The speaker does not want to abandon this place (or way of life) she has been living in, but she has no choice. The next section describes how while on the path she can hear people singing joyously and it fills her with happiness. The whole world is heightened there, from the greens of the summer to the winter snow. Now that she knows she has to leave this world she is determined to make herself a better person. She knows she hasn't been the kindest or most thoughtful human being. In the last stanza, she asks that God forgive her for that fact and allow her to spend her future days comforting those who have not been as lucky as she."

The speaker of this poem has passed the day each year thinking about the day when he will die. He can imagine how the fire of life will wave him goodbye. Then the everlasting silence will set out like a tireless traveler. Death would change his take on life and human beings as well.

The speaker starts off the poem by stating, quite clearly, that the world is filled with sorrow, and they sometimes get caught up in despair worrying about it. It's this worry that drives them out of their life and into the world of the “wild things.” There, beside the water where the great heron drinks and under the “day-blind” stars, they can see things clearly. The natural world does not engage in the same intense forethought that humanity does. This lack of worry appeals to the speaker and makes them feel free, at least for a time."

One might say love. At any rate, I now walk
Wary (for it could happen
Even in this dull, ruinous landscape); sceptical
Yet politic, ignorant

Of whatever angel any choose to flare
Suddenly at my elbow. I only know that a rook
Ordering its black feathers can so shine
As to seize my senses, haul
My eyelids up, and grant

A brief respite from fear
Of total neutrality. With luck,
Trekking stubborn through this season
Of fatigue, I shall
Patch together a content

Of sorts. Miracles occur.
If you care to call those spasmodic
Tricks of radiance

The long wait for the angel,

For that rare, random descent.",I do not expect a miracle or an accident to set the sight on fire in my eye,"'Black Rook in Rainy Weather' narrates how the lyrical voice sees a black rook outside and the thoughts it brings. Although the poem seems simple at first, the rook is a symbol that lets the lyrical voice explore the significance of the ordinary. Hence, the poem itself is a big metaphor, a series of thoughts, related to a particular view on life. The lyrical voice carefully constructs this metaphor with many poetic devices that emphasize the visual aspect as well as the thoughtful tone found throughout the lines."
1082,1093,1093,"The unpurged images of day recede;
The Emperor's drunken soldiery are abed;
Night resonance recedes, night-walkers' song
After great cathedral gong;
A starlit or a moonlit dome disdains
All that man is,
All mere complexities,
The fury and the mire of human veins.

Before me floats an image, man or shade,
Shade more than man, more image than a shade;
For Hades' bobbin bound in mummy-cloth
May unwind the winding path;
A mouth that has no moisture and no breath
Breathless mouths may summon;
I hail the superhuman;
I call it death-in-life and life-in-death.

Miracle, bird or golden handiwork,
More miracle than bird or handiwork,
Planted on the starlit golden bough,
Can like the cocks of Hades crow,
Or, by the moon embittered, scorn aloud
In glory of changeless metal
Common bird or petal
And all complexities of mire or blood.

At midnight on the Emperor's pavement flit
Flames that no faggot feeds, nor steel has lit,
Nor storm disturbs, flames begotten of flame,
Where blood-begotten spirits come
And all complexities of fury leave,
Dying into a dance,
An agony of trance,
An agony of flame that cannot singe a sleeve.

Astraddle on the dolphin's mire and blood,
Spirit after spirit! The smithies break the flood,
The golden smithies of the Emperor!
Marbles of the dancing floor
Break bitter furies of complexity,
Those images that yet
Fresh images beget,
That dolphin-torn, that gong-tormented sea.",The unpurged images of day recede; The Emperor's drunken soldiery are,"The poem 'Byzantium' deliberates what happens at night in the city of Byzantium, through the first-person perspective. As the night emerges, in the city of Byzantium, the day's activities recede. The drunken soldiers of the Emperor are asleep, and the song of night-walkers too fades along with other night sounds, after the great cathedral gong. The “starlit” or “moonlit” dome, disdains everything that is human, for human life is mere complexities filled with fury and the mire of human veins. As he observes the scene around him, the speaker sees an image floating in front of him. The speaker addresses the spirit as “superhuman”, for it reflects the ultimate truth of “death-in-life and life-in-death.” The poet follows the floating image to find a golden bird perching on a golden tree like a “miracle”. It calls and scorns the birds of “mire and blood.” At midnight, the images float through the flames across the Emperor's pavement. The fire seems to be self-generated and self-fed for it was fed by neither wood nor steel. Even the storm has no effect on it. Here, “blood-begotten spirits” come and “dance” in a “trance” and be cleared of all earthly impurities. Finally, spirit after spirit arrives at the seashore to be carried across the sea on the backs of dolphins. The golden smithies of the Emperor ensure the perfection of the end process, while the flames ensure the speckles cleansing of the spirits on land."

At the beginning of the poem, the poet starts by using the line that later became the title. She lists out words someone of mixed-race might be called. These are all offensive in some form or another and suggest the power of labels. She expresses her belief that one can't live by one single label or identity to survive in the borderland. The poet goes on, explaining the complexities of living with the weight of five races on her back. She understands the fact that she can't discount or ignore one part of her personal history, whether that part is black or white. The poet also touches on the struggle marginalized groups have, and have had, with alcoholism and suicide and the need to fight back against one's more dangerous impulses. 'To Live in the Borderland' concludes with the poet expressing her belief that one must “be a crossroads” and exist between and within all worlds from which one was born."

They accommodate themselves to my milkbottle, flattening their sides.

Bits of burnt paper wheeling in a blown sky.

These hills are too green and sweet to have tasted salt.

In the first stanza, the poet describes walking through a blackberry alley, getting the fruit juice on her hands, and feeling connected to the plant. She's alone, she notes, as the only human being present on a walk to the sea. The ocean is in the distance, but she can't see it. She takes note of blackbirds and swarming black flies that feast on the blackberries. The sea is still out of sight, and she isn't sure if she will ever get there. In the final stanza, she comes through a funnel between the hills and sees the sea, which she also describes as nothing. She compares its movements and sound to the hammering of a silversmith."

The poet spends most of the poem describing how the earth changes from deepest winter to warmest spring. This includes birds and flowers waking up and animals moving into the sun to sleep.

She asks it to do anything it can to cut its way through the heat of the day. It should rend it to piece, tear it apart, and destroy it. The heat is so oppressive that it is keeping fruit from falling off trees. The poem concludes with a repetition of the speaker's original request and some interesting images."

Given the narrator's mental state, the feelings of anger due to the end of his former relationship, it would be easy for the poem to have a somber, morose tone. But it is full of positivity.

of plumping the heaviest stone
into the shallows, and yet,
distance throwing has defeated me.

tentatively flipped before selection.
This is my talent – a whiplash from the hip,
the skite, innumerable tangents, then a glide
until, as if remembering the laws of gravity,
it stops and languidly slews before anchoring.
One facet of the art of skimming, I say
is that, by overriding the big splash,
sound release is reduced to a whispering skiff
thus reinforcing the attenuated decay of energy…

The poem begins with a brief description of the poet's childhood vocation, which is stone skimming. She describes how she failed to pick the right stone and make them float. As she grew up, she mastered the art right from the very beginning, that is the selection of flat-bottomed stone. Then she goes on to talk about the art of stone skimming itself. Using jargon, she puts forth how a stone should be thrown and how it settles down, remembering the gravitational pull. By the end of the poem, Bleakney admits that no matter how she tries to magnify her childhood obsession with applied physics, the audience could understand that it is her “panache” or “primitive desire” to rearrange the shoreline the way she could."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that autumn is on its way, but it doesn't appear that way to anyone else. The speaker is able to sense, through the smells in the air, that soon all the green on the trees will wilt. In the second stanza, the speaker relates her own memories to those depicted in Proust's novel, Swann's Way. In it he tells of a narrator's return to a childhood memory after dipping a madeleine in tea. The poem concludes with the speaker defining why and how human beings name and categorize seasons. She also recalls her own madeleine moment related to the coming of autumn. It seems to her that she is able to call the season forward with only the word “Autumn.” "

In the first part of the poem, the speaker begins by asking God why he's punished more severely than the other living things around him. He feels as though just because he's capable of thinking and reasoning that his sins shouldn't be punished more harshly than the goat, tree, or snake. The speaker asks God to deliver mercy instead. The poem ends with a turn. The poet's speaker transitions into discussing how he shouldn't question God. His demanding tone in the first lines turns into an apologetic and regretful one. He asks that God washes him clean of sin, so clean that even God forgets he ever did anything wrong."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that there was a wind that blew through all the “nooks and crannies” in a house. It was able to get into all the little corners and find all the hidden spaces. It also spent a great deal of time bothering “Granny.” It swirled around her body and went into her nose and ears. The wind is described very cunningly as if it was choosing to seek people out and mess with them. In the next lines, the speaker describes how the wind scared a “vicar.” It was not just a nuisance, it almost caused a great deal of harm. The wind was so strong that it blew the top off the steeple of the church which almost landed on the vicar and some other unnamed people. The last stanza contains a list-like description of who the wind troubled. These people listed out by the speaker are all different. They range from a “beast” to a “nun.” Finally, the wind makes its way back to Granny. It is so strong that it almost blows her to the ground."

A single word, like “yes” or “no,” can change someone to the core. She goes on to say that there are two different ways to speak. One might take their time, like a connoisseur, making sure each word is exactly right, or one can speak spontaneously, and from the heart. The latter is the speaker's clear preference as she seems to think polishing each word to its maximum will not have the desired outcome. In the final stanza, she speaks of how a polished word will never come into being the way that a spontaneous one does. The sheer labor that went into it keeps it from meaning quite as much."

Some soldiers headed by Green Beret, the commander, held the boy and his father captive to know some details about the hiding place of some people. They were hiding somewhere and the soldiers thought the boy knew where they were. When the boy was interrogated, he remained silent. His silence could save his people, but not his father.

It seems as though those who understand their own personal sadnesses intimately are always looking to express them in ways that are often artistic and well-known. When a poet writes a meaningful song that expresses their sorrow in intricate, deep, powerful ways, they often wind up writing poems that rank among their most popular. And yet, apart from the value of empathy, these poems say very little for sadness, and rather tend to be descriptions that are about sadness. A poem like Margaret Atwood’s A Sad Child, on the other hand, deals with sorrow in a different kind of way; direct, and as something to be addressed and resolved, rather than something that simply is."

But not because of its magnificence Dear is the Casuarina to my soul: Beneath it we have played; though years may roll, O sweet companions, loved with love intense, For your sakes, shall the tree be ever dear. Blent with your images, it shall arise In memory, till the hot tears blind mine eyes! What is that dirge-like murmur that I hear Like the sea breaking on a shingle-beach? It is the tree’s lament, an eerie speech, That haply to the unknown land may reach. Unknown, yet well-known to the eye of faith! Ah, I have heard that wail far, far away In distant lands, by many a sheltered bay, When slumbered in his cave the water-wraith And the waves gently kissed the classic shore Of France or Italy, beneath the moon, When earth lay trancèd in a dreamless swoon: And every time the music rose,—before Mine inner vision rose a form sublime, Thy form, O Tree, as in my happy prime I saw thee, in my own loved native clime. Therefore I fain would consecrate a lay Unto thy honor, Tree, beloved of those Who now in blessed sleep for aye repose,— Dearer than life to me, alas, were they! Mayst thou be numbered when my days are done With deathless trees—like those in Borrowdale, Under whose awful branches lingered pale “Fear, trembling Hope, and Death, the skeleton, And Time the shadow;” and though weak the verse That would thy beauty fain, oh, fain rehearse, May Love defend thee from Oblivion’s curse.","The thorny trunk, indented deep with scars, up to its very","Toru Dutt’s ‘Our Casuarina Tree’ explores the poet’s childhood memories in India. Her description of the tree expresses her pride on the tree for it remains strong despite the creeper winding around like a python. From her description of its appearance, she moves on to describe the activities happening around it in the next stanza. In the third stanza, she ensures that the beauty of the tree is no more than an added gift, for her real connection with the tree lies on the numerous happy memories she shared with it. In the stanza follows, she tells how the tree manifests itself in the foreign land as she has seen it at her young age. Finally, in the concluding part, she wants to honor the tree, therefore she makes an attempt to write a poem. Also, she seeks Love’s support to preserve the tree from the affliction of time."
1100,1111,1111,"Love is not all: it is not meat nor drink
Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain; Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink And rise and sink and rise and sink again; Love can not fill the thickened lung with breath, Nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone; Yet many a man is making friends with death Even as I speak, for lack of love alone. It well may be that in a difficult hour, Pinned down by pain and moaning for release, Or nagged by want past resolution's power, I might be driven to sell your love for peace, Or trade the memory of this night for food. It well may be. I do not think I would.",Love is not all; it is not meat nor drink nor slumber nor ,"The poem, which can be read here, begins with a basic statement that stands to summarize the first half of the poem, and is also the title, “Love is not all.” This is followed up by to more statements that carry the poem through the first quatrain. Millay states that “Love is not all;” it is not, she continues, either meat or drink. It is also neither, “slumber nor a roof against the rain.” These are things that are critical to human survival, shelter, sleep, food, and water. They plainly contrast with the emotion of love, something that Millay is hoping to call attention to. She is attempting to lessen loves importance by comparing to things one physically cannot live without. Continuing on to the second half of the first quatrain, Millay creates another metaphor, or a comparison between two unlikely elements. Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink And rise and sink and rise and sink again; In this instance Millay is once again comparing love to something physically critical to human survival, a “spar.” A spar is a strong pole that is used as a mast of a ship. In this comparison, it is something a man on a sinking ship would want desperately as a way to reinforce his damaged vessel. Love would do him little good at this critical moment. The next line is a repetition of the motions of a drowning man as he sinks below the surface only to rise up again and sink once more. The second quatrain begins with: Love can not fill the thickened lung with breath, Millay continues the comparison at the end of the first quatrain as she speaks here of death and the little good love will have in stopping it. In this case the “thicken[ing] [of] lung.” This could refer once again to drowning or more likely to tuberculosis. This second theory is reinforced by the first half of the next line: Nor clean the blood, It is well known that when one is afflicted with tuberculosis the lungs can begin to fill with blood and during the 1930's TB was much more prevalent than it is today. This makes it a likely disease for Millay to have chosen to contrast against love. She makes one last comparison in this quatrain, describing how love cannot set the fractured bone. In general, with these metaphors, she is attempting to get across the notion that love is nothing but an emotion that can do nothing for one in a critical, life threatening situation. This is the turning point of the sonnet, or volta. A volta is a vital point in almost all sonnets in which many things can happen. The transition from one speaker to another, a change in opinion, or in this case, a change in perspective. After this point, the speaker starts using first person to address the issue more personally. Yet many a man is making friends with death Even as I speak, for lack of love alone. In these lines, Millay references all the comparisons above, and her speaker is saying, basically, that even with all the truths that have thus far been stated, men still kill themselves because they do not have love. This line is written with a kind of disbelief as if the speaker has a hard time understanding how this could possibly be the case. The next quatrain and final couplet are single idea contemplated by the speaker on what she might do in various situations if she had love and could give it away to save herself or assuage some kind of pain. It well may be that in a difficult hour, Pinned down by pain and moaning for release, Here the speaker begins to list possible scenarios in which she might be willing to, give away “your love for peace,” as she states in the last line of the final quatrain. These two scenarios mirror the ones the speaker has described in the first half of the poem, a difficult hour without food, water, or shelter, and pinned down by pain as if afflicted with a deadly disease such as tuberculosis was then. The next line is one of the most poignant. Or nagged by want past resolution's power, In this line the speaker remembers her life before the start of this love she is ruminating on. She remembers the decisions she used to make and the resolution, or determination, that they had. One may infer that now, at least to the speaker, her decisions are weaker, influenced by love's sway or the stronger will of her partner. The final comparison comes in the first line of the couplet in which the speaker considers “trading the memory” of one particularly special night for food, These are all things, the speaker contemplates, she may be willing to sell her love to gain, or regain. The final line of the poem is the conclusion of all of this contemplation and consideration. She considers once more that she may “sell your love,” but concludes that, even with all her rational arguments throughout the sonnet, she does not think she would. This final turn in the last line of the poem shows the speaker to be just as fallible and subject to the control love places over one's decisions as all those she formally references."
1101,1112,1112,"Just after my wife's miscarriage (her second 
in four months), I was sitting in an empty 
classroom exchanging notes with my friend, 
a budding Joyce scholar with steelrimmed 
glasses, when, lapsed Irish Catholic that he was, 
he surprised me by asking what I thought now 
of God's ways toward man. It was spring,

such spring as came to the flintbacked Chenango 
Valley thirty years ago, the full force of Siberia 
behind each blast of wind. Once more my poor wife 
was in the local four-room hospital, recovering. 
The sun was going down, the room's pinewood panels 
all but swallowing the gelid light, when, suddenly, 
I surprised not only myself but my colleague

by raising my middle finger up to heaven, quid 
pro quo, the hardly grand defiant gesture a variant 
on Vanni Fucci's figs, shocking not only my friend 
but in truth the gesture's perpetrator too. I was 24, 
and, in spite of having pored over the Confessions 
& that Catholic Tractate called the Summa, was sure 
I'd seen enough of God's erstwhile ways toward man.

That summer, under a pulsing midnight sky 
shimmering with Van Gogh stars, in a creaking, 
cedarscented cabin off Lake George, having lied 
to the gentrified owner of the boys' camp 
that indeed I knew wilderness & lakes and could, 
if need be, lead a whole fleet of canoes down 
the turbulent whitewater passages of the Fulton Chain

(I who had last been in a rowboat with my parents 
at the age of six), my wife and I made love, trying 
not to disturb whosever headboard & waterglass 
lie just beyond the paperthin partition at our feet. 
In the great black Adirondack stillness, as we lay 
there on our sagging mattress, my wife & I gazed out 
through the broken roof into a sky that seemed

somehow to look back down on us, and in that place, 
that holy place, she must have conceived again, 
for nine months later in a New York hospital she 
brought forth a son, a little buddha-bellied 
rumplestiltskin runt of a man who burned 
to face the sun, the fact of his being there 
both terrifying & lifting me at once, this son,

this gift, whom I still look upon with joy & awe. Worst, 
best, just last year, this same son, grown
to manhood now, knelt before a marble altar to vow 
everything he had to the same God I had had my own 
erstwhile dealings with. How does one bargain
with a God like this, who, quid pro quo, ups 
the ante each time He answers one sign with another?","When my wife miscarriage, I was sitting in an empty classroom exchanging notes with","'Quid Pro Quo' by Paul Mariani is about an angry young man's heartfelt confessions after experiencing the second miscarriage of his wife. When the “flintbacked” Chenango Valley of New York unleashed itself in spring, the speaker, a twenty-four-year-old man, witnessed the loss of his second unborn child. It was the second time within a span of four months his wife miscarried. His colleague, a lapsed Irish Catholic, asked what he thought about “God's ways toward man,” signaling at the recent incident. In his reply, he not only shocked his colleague but also himself by showing his middle finger up to heaven, particularly to God. Later, his wife conceived again and that time a baby boy was born. It made him rethink his response to God when he was grieving."

1104,1115,1115,"And cannot pleasures, while they last,
Be actual unless, when past,
They leave us shuddering and aghast,
With anguish smarting?
And cannot friends be firm and fast,
And yet bear parting?

And must I then, at Friendship's call,
Calmly resign the little all

I have of gladness,
And lend my being to the thrall
Of gloom and sadness?

And think you that I should be dumb,
And full DOLORUM OMNIUM,
Excepting when YOU choose to come
And share my dinner?
At other times be sour and glum
And daily thinner?

Must he then only live to weep,
Who'd prove his friendship true and deep
By day a lonely shadow creep,
At night-time languish,
Oft raising in his broken sleep
The moan of anguish?

The lover, if for certain days
His fair one be denied his gaze,
Sinks not in grief and wild amaze,
But, wiser wooer,
He spends the time in writing lays,
And posts them to her.

And if the verse flow free and fast,
Till even the poet is aghast,
A touching Valentine at last
The post shall carry,
When thirteen days are gone and past
Of February.

Farewell, dear friend, and when we meet,
In desert waste or crowded street,
Perhaps before this week shall fleet,
Perhaps to-morrow.
I trust to find YOUR heart the seat
Of wasting sorrow.","And cannot pleasures, while they last, Be actual unless, when past, They leave","A Valentine' by Lewis Carroll is an interesting and multilayered poem in which the speaker discusses two different kinds of relationships. The speaker spends the first five stanzas talking about, and talking around, what friendship is. He alludes to its complexities and then zeros in on how difficult friendships are. He presents an unusual and probably surprising opinion about their value. As it becomes clear in the middle of the poem, the speaker is thinking about one person in particular, but at first, it seems like he's talking about all friendly relationships. He depicts them as suffocating, emotionally abusive, and controlling. He wonders if it's possible to have one where someone isn't expected to cry and worry about their friend whenever they aren't together. Through these questions, readers can come to understand the nature of the friendship this speaker has experienced. In the mid-point of the poem, he transitions to compare friendships to love affairs. The latter, he states, is far more pleasant in that the lover doesn't weep and constantly grieve in the absence of their friend. Instead, they compose poetry. These lines are sent, via the mail, to their beloved for Valentine's day. To conclude the poem, Carroll's speaker expresses his hope that this friend, “YOU,” sees him on the street later in life and weeps as he used to weep."

She is wondering if their love every really existed, or whether it was just a figment of her imagination. The speaker also tells her lover that when she closes her eyes, death and destruction loom, but when she opens them, all has been reborn. She goes on to tell her lover that she thought he would return to her since he told her he would, but it has been so long that she knows he is not coming back. 'Mad Girl's Love Song' ends with Plath telling her former lover that she should have loved something like a thunderbird because it at least comes back after the winter—her lover, however, is gone, never to return.

He is chasing his kite along a hill, trying to keep a hold of the string. The boy looks into the future and imagines the kite being ripped from his hands. It would fly for a night and a day and then eventually he would find it. When this happened it would imbue him with an answer to the question of where the wind is going. He states that he'd be able to relay this answer to the others, although he still wouldn't know where the wind comes from."

I would like to watch you","Variations on the Word Sleep by Margaret Atwood gets deep into the mind of the speaker and her desire to be one with the one she loves. At points throughout the poem, she uses terms that are usually used in a sexual context, but she makes it clear that her desire to be one with her lover goes far beyond the physical realm.

She desires to be one with him in mind and soul. And the innermost part of a human being, lies the subconscious, the part of every person’s mind that surfaces during sleep in the form of dreams. A person’s dreams are often non-sensical, and yet they stem for experiences and thoughts that lie deep in the unconscious. This speaker longs to tap into that deepest, most intimate part of the person she loves. She begins by simply stating that she wishes she could watch her lover sleep. It seems strange at first, and a little disconcerting, but as she begins to explain her reasoning, the reader can identify with her.

After having expressed her desire to watch her lover sleep, she goes a little deeper, and wishes that she could enter into his sleep with him. From here, the speaker imagines what she might find if she were in fact able to enter into his dreams. Her description of her desires allows the reader to see a pure and true heart, one that loves fully without holding back. There are few ways to describe this kind of love, but this speaker is able to put her longing into words so unique and so moving that the reader feels he is able to embody the very emotions the speaker portrays. Variations on the Word Sleep is more than just a love poem. It is a poem that seeks to enter the conscious and the subconscious by exploring one person’s earnest desire to know another person at the very depths of his soul."

They grew up with him as a distant figure, more of a guardian angel who didn't intervene, rather than a hands-on parent. As the poem concludes the speaker realizes that more than anything he should've held his children and shown them that he loved them."

It was published with alternative lyrics, to those which are popular today, in Camp and Camino in Lower California in 1910. In this publication, it was referred to as 'Spider Song.' This version of the text was a little more explicit than a reader might be used to. Rather than using the phrase “itsy bitsy “the words were “blooming, bloody.” The words were later changed to make it more child-friendly. Additionally, the spider was climbing within its own web rather than up a waterspout. This simple change is interesting to consider. Why, in following versions, is the spider climbing up a waterspout? The lyrics to Camp and Camino in Lower California version went as follows: Oh, the blooming, bloody spider went up the spider web, The blooming, bloody rain came down and washed the spider out, The blooming, bloody sun came out and dried up all the rain, And the blooming, bloody spider came up the web again. Other versions of the song refer to the spider as “Incey Wincy,” rather than “Itsy Bitsy,” such as in Australia and Great Britain. Alternatively, the waterspout is sometimes the spout of a teapot. More versions were published over the next 40 years and one of the modern versions appeared in Western Folklore by the California Folklore Society in 1948 another was published in American Folk Songs for children that same year. One version of the contemporary lyrics are as follows: The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the waterspout. Down came the rain and washed the spider out. Out came the sun and dried up all the rain and the itsy bitsy spider climbed up the spout again."

The front steps are also broken, he says, yet another problem that hasn't been addressed. The landlord wants the speaker to pay him money without any of the repairs having been completed. This is something the speaker disagrees with. He knows that there's a possibility that the landlord is going to continue to make life hard for him. Perhaps by turning off the heat.

Out there, we've walked quite friendly up to Death,-
Sat down and eaten with him, cool and bland,-
Pardoned his spilling mess-tins in our hand.
We've sniffed the green thick odour of his breath,-
Our eyes wept, but our courage didn't writhe.
He's spat at us with bullets and he's coughed
Shrapnel. We chorussed when he sang aloft,
We whistled while he shaved us with his scythe.

Oh, Death was never enemy of ours!
We laughed at him, we leagued with him, old chum.
No soldier's paid to kick against His powers.

And greater wars: when each proud fighter brags
He wars on Death, for lives; not men, for flags.","War's a joke for me and you, Wile we know such dreams are true","'The Next War' by Wilfred Owen is a dark and cynical poem about the horrors of war, the loss of life, and war's ineffectiveness. The unnamed speaker in this piece describes in the first lines of the poem that he and his comrades have become “friendly” with death. They have lived around him for so long that his presence has lost its impact. Everyone is used to “him” by now. Death is described with poignant and disturbing imagery that leads the reader into the second half of the poem. There, the speaker describes how death is not the true enemy that the soldiers face on the battlefield. He was their fellow comrade more than anything else. The last lines allude to the endless nature of war and the “flags” that soldiers fight for and against. Discover more Wilfred Owen poems."

Always watered, fed, guarded, admired,
But harnessed to a pot of dirt.
I'd rather be a tall, ugly weed,
Clinging on cliffs, like an eagle
Wind-wavering above high, jagged rocks.
To have broken through the surface of stone,

To be swayed by the breezes of an ancient sea,
Carrying my soul, my seed,

Then shunned by everyone,
Than to be a pleasant-smelling flower,
Growing in clusters in the fertile valley,

By greedy, human hands.

Than of sweet, fragrant lilac.

The poem immediately establishes a contrast between the narrator and those around him, who are mocked for their uniformity and cultivated sense of identity. The poet compares them to flowers, which allows the narrator to stand out by identifying with the ordinarily reviled weed. By emphasizing this contrast, Noboa Polanco is able to challenge his readers' preconceived notions of beauty and autonomy.The poem goes on to explore characteristics that are normally considered abhorrent, like ugliness and smelling unpleasant. However, the narrator defends these features and regards them as preferable to fitting in for the sake of it."

And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey,
Legless, sewn short at elbow. Through the park
Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn,
Voices of play and pleasure after day,
Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him.

About this time Town used to swing so gay
When glow-lamps budded in the light-blue trees, And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,—
In the old times, before he threw away his knees.
Now he will never feel again how slim
Girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands,
All of them touch him like some queer disease.

There was an artist silly for his face,
For it was younger than his youth, last year.
Now, he is old; his back will never brace;
He's lost his colour very far from here,
Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,
And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race And leap of purple spurted from his thigh.

One time he liked a blood-smear down his leg,
After the matches carried shoulder-high.
It was after football, when he'd drunk a peg,
He thought he'd better join. He wonders why.
Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts.
That's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg,
Aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts,
He asked to join. He didn't have to beg;
Smiling they wrote his lie: aged nineteen years.
Germans he scarcely thought of, all their guilt,
And Austria's, did not move him. And no fears
Of Fear came yet. He thought of jewelled hilts
For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes;
And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears;
Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits.
And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers.

Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal.
Only a solemn man who brought him fruits
Thanked him; and then inquired about his soul.

Now, he will spend a few sick years in institutes,
And do what things the rules consider wise,
And take whatever pity they may dole.
Tonight he noticed how the women's eyes
Passed from him to the strong men that were whole.

And put him into bed? Why don't they come?","A man shivered in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark,","Written in 1917 by one of the most famous British War poets, Wilfred Owen, 'Disabled' explores the physical and psychological trauma experienced during WW1, through the depiction of an injured war veteran. A young soldier sits isolated in a hospital and mournfully reflects on his decision to go to War – a comment on the misleading propaganda that influenced many young men to enlist. The speaker juxtaposes his current state of trauma and depression with his joyful life before the war. He mourns the life and youth that the war stole from him, as he spends the rest of his days in isolation and in 'sick institutes'. It is a powerful comment on the debilitating effects of WWI."

This poem begins with the speaker describing how he was eight years old and riding around Baltimore. He was thrilled to be there and felt glee at everything he saw. He noticed someone in the city, a Baltimorean, staring at him. He notes that this other child, looking at him intently, was not much older or bigger. He remembers smiling at the Baltimorean, and then, rather than reciprocating his kindness, the other child stuck out his tongue at the speaker and used a racial slur. Throughout the rest of the year, the young speaker saw all of Baltimore, but, despite many other more pleasant experiences, this one “incident” is the only thing that stuck with him."

The poem begins with the speaker describing her husband’s second-best bed as a place of wonder. It was filled with wonderful things like “torchlight” and “clifftops.” Anne clearly feels very attached to this bed and finds memories of her husband within it. It is not just their sex and love that she recalls there, but also his “words.” In bed together, the speaker says, they mimicked and mirrored one another. She was the “softer rhyme” to his harder. Anne goes on to state that she wishes he had written her with his “writer’s hands.” Duffy decided to interpret the “second best bed” portion of Shakespeare’s will differently than most scholars do. Rather than making the willing of his second-best bed a spiteful gesture towards Anne, it was an expression of his deepest love."

In it, the poet depicts the effect of a son's death in the war on his family.

As they all read the letter, in among their beautiful and prospering farm, they learn that the son, Pete, has been injured in the war and is in the hospital. Despite the fact that the letter says that he'll be well soon, it's obvious to the mother that this isn't the case. It does turn out that the son, at that very moment, died. The mother mourns, and the poem concludes with an allusion to her desire to kill herself."

The speaker spends the three lines of ‘After Killing a Spider’ describing what he felt after killing a spider. It doesn’t improve his situation whatsoever. Instead, he’s left even lonelier than he was, to begin with. This lesson has a great deal to share. Just because a life is small, the poem suggests, doesn’t mean it is without value. By killing the spider, the speaker removed the one companion he had in his loneliness.

It is written in eight stanzas of all four lines each. There is an inconsistent ABAB rhyme pattern throughout. I think this represents the “up and down” nature of 'On A Portrait Of A Deaf Man' as Betjeman struggles to deal with his emotions."

In the first line of 'A Poppy Blooms,' the speaker begins by acknowledging the repetitive process that marks his writing. It's not a linear process. This means that he doesn't start at the beginning and end up at the end smoothly and without pause. Instead, it's a process of creation and destruction. He writes and then erases. The second line emphasizes this. The erasing goes on, marking the need for perseverance in the face of creative adversity. Eventually, as the third line reveals, he's going to create something that brings beauty and joy to the world—the metaphorical poppy blooms."

The speaker opens the poem by saying that he'd rather be a “stone” than take the form of a tiger or a dove. Stones are calm, cool, and unchanged as they're tossed around and stepped on. They also evoke curiosity on the part of all those who stare at their cold exteriors. The speaker also notes how inside the stone, there could be anything going on.

The poem begins with the speaker describing all of the changes that have come over a much love landscape that she is quite familiar with. This place is no longer the rich land of “red lilies” and singing robins. The colder days of winter have come and covered over the beautiful flowers and driven a robin, who they once thrilled to hear sing, off to warmer forests. She continues to criticize the robin for leaving the land she loves so deeply. She does not believe that “he” should have deserted them so easily. She feels scornful and rueful about the changes and is determined to not let them hurt her relationship. The final stanza presents to the reader the reasons why the relationship between the listener and the speaker is not going to fail just because time is progressing. Unlike the robin who sings alone in a warmer clime, the speaker and her lover are going to be together. Their song will be fueled by their mutual love for one another."

The poem begins with the speaker introducing one such tree that has been driven to “decay” by the chilly autumn winds. The leaves have been unable to withstand the onslaught and many have fallen to the ground. Of those that remain, perhaps 20 out of the original “millions,” the speaker describes as being stubborn in their resistance. They represent the majority of humankind and man's inability to accept death. The poem concludes with the speaker stating that there is no wisdom in trying to live forever and even if one is avoiding death, there are many things still to fear in prolonged life."

In the first lines of the piece, Atwood's speaker compares the human body, while dreaming, to that of birds. One can rise up and float into the sky. Then, eventually, enter into space. From there, the world is beautiful and brilliant, a loving “seablue”. The images that make up this dream sequence are contrasted with the reality of life in the last four lines. Like a loaded gun, the sun weighs down on one's skull. “You” try to rise, fly and transcend as you did in the dream world, but it's impossible."

It can be assumed that Milligan wrote this poem for one of the children, considering the parental tone of the poem. The phrase 'things that go bump in the night' was first used in print in the year 1918, in the Bulletin of the School Oriental and African Studies: “To a people … who … believe in genii, ghosts, goblins, and those terrific things that 'go bump in the night', protective charms are eagerly sought for.” The fact that the quote is not explained insinuates that the phrase would have been familiar to readers at the time. This means that the common usage of the phrase could extend back further than we know."

The choice of Qurana’s wording creates a sardonic atmosphere that infuses into the lines, and the overall poem comes as a warning to authors to wait for the right wording, no matter how evasive it is, since forcing ideas and phrasing can lead to a subpar product. Qurana claims that he has forced this “bird” into his “text,” and the result was that the writing did not come to be. In the end, then, this is guidance and advice from one writer to another."

Nemerov finds it hard to believe the Greek legend of the Theseus and the Minotaur. He uses the symbol of “labyrinth” from Greek mythology in order to compare it to modern wars. Wars have always been part of histories like legend and folklore. Whether it is the history of America, Asia, or Europe, the topic of war has always been there. It leaves a lasting mark on people's minds, causes indelible scars, and terrifies their hearts. In this poem, Nemerov ingeniously co-relates Greek mythology and the Vietnam War in the lines, “still the elders sent/ Their quota of kids to Knossos.” He ironically comments on the younger generation's fascination with the “Good War” in the last line, “They would find something to die of, and for.”"

She then moves on to the silence, roads now emptied and people sat still in their homes. The sudden lack of possibility meant that people had more time for each other. This sense of community spans across the globe, with people coming together. The final stanza focuses on the social practices that have come from the pandemic, 'call, check in, reassure' that everyone is okay."
1138,1149,1149,"As I sit looking out of a window of the building
I wish I did not have to write the instruction manual on the uses of a new metal.
I look down into the street and see people, each walking with an inner peace, And envy them—they are so far away from me!
Not one of them has to worry about getting out this manual on schedule. And, as my way is, I begin to dream, resting my elbows on the desk and leaning out of the window a little,
Of dim Guadalajara! City of rose-colored flowers!
City I wanted most to see, and most did not see, in Mexico!
But I fancy I see, under the press of having to write the instruction manual, Your public square, city, with its elaborate little bandstand!
The band is playing Scheherazade by Rimsky-Korsakov.
Around stand the flower girls, handing out rose- and lemon-colored flowers, Each attractive in her rose-and-blue striped dress (Oh! such shades of rose and blue),
And nearby is the little white booth where women in green serve you green and yellow fruit.
The couples are parading; everyone is in a holiday mood.
First, leading the parade, is a dapper fellow
Clothed in deep blue. On his head sits a white hat
And he wears a mustache, which has been trimmed for the occasion.
His dear one, his wife, is young and pretty; her shawl is rose, pink, and white. Her slippers are patent leather, in the American fashion,
And she carries a fan, for she is modest, and does not want the crowd to see her face too often.
But everybody is so busy with his wife or loved one
I doubt they would notice the mustachioed man’s wife.
Here come the boys! They are skipping and throwing little things on the sidewalk
Which is made of gray tile. One of them, a little older, has a toothpick in his teeth.
He is silenter than the rest, and affects not to notice the pretty young girls in white.
But his friends notice them, and shout their jeers at the laughing girls. Yet soon all this will cease, with the deepening of their years,
And love bring each to the parade grounds for another reason.
But I have lost sight of the young fellow with the toothpick.
Wait—there he is—on the other side of the bandstand,
Secluded from his friends, in earnest talk with a young girl
Of fourteen or fifteen. I try to hear what they are saying
But it seems they are just mumbling something—shy words of love, probably.
She is slightly taller than he, and looks quietly down into his sincere eyes. She is wearing white. The breeze ruffles her long fine black hair against her olive cheek.
Obviously she is in love. The boy, the young boy with the toothpick, he is in love too;
His eyes show it. Turning from this couple,
I see there is an intermission in the concert.
The paraders are resting and sipping drinks through straws
(The drinks are dispensed from a large glass crock by a lady in dark blue), And the musicians mingle among them, in their creamy white uniforms, and talk
About the weather, perhaps, or how their kids are doing at school.
Let us take this opportunity to tiptoe into one of the side streets. Here you may see one of those white houses with green trim That are so popular here. Look—I told you!
It is cool and dim inside, but the patio is sunny.
An old woman in gray sits there, fanning herself with a palm leaf fan. She welcomes us to her patio, and offers us a cooling drink. “My son is in Mexico City,” she says. “He would welcome you too If he were here. But his job is with a bank there.
Look, here is a photograph of him.”
And a dark-skinned lad with pearly teeth grins out at us from the worn leather frame.
We thank her for her hospitality, for it is getting late
And we must catch a view of the city, before we leave, from a good high place.
That church tower will do—the faded pink one, there against the fierce blue of the sky. Slowly we enter.
The caretaker, an old man dressed in brown and gray, asks us how long we have been in the city, and how we like it here.
His daughter is scrubbing the steps—she nods to us as we pass into the tower.
Soon we have reached the top, and the whole network of the city extends before us.
There is the rich quarter, with its houses of pink and white, and its crumbling, leafy terraces.
There is the poorer quarter, its homes a deep blue.
There is the market, where men are selling hats and swatting flies
And there is the public library, painted several shades of pale green and beige.
Look! There is the square we just came from, with the promenaders. There are fewer of them, now that the heat of the day has increased, But the young boy and girl still lurk in the shadows of the bandstand. And there is the home of the little old lady—
She is still sitting in the patio, fanning herself.
How limited, but how complete withal, has been our experience of Guadalajara!
We have seen young love, married love, and the love of an aged mother for her son.
We have heard the music, tasted the drinks, and looked at colored houses. What more is there to do, except stay? And that we cannot do.
And as a last breeze freshens the top of the weathered old tower, I turn my
gaze

The creative person is drawn to that imaginative world and prefers that wonder to the rigidity of “instruction[al]” “writ[ing].” In fact, the livelihood of a right imagination is showcased as too vivid and full of possibility to overlook, almost as if Ashbery is providing a rationale for a person seeking to remain in a “dream” state. Creativity, in the end, is vastly important in the poem, and a person linked strongly to creativity will fall into their imagination without fault. These ideas are the driving forces of the poem."

It is meant to confront the reader with the reality of homelessness and make them realize that they could do more to help. Armitage does this by having the narrator address the reader in the second person, making the reader feel responsible for the actions of the person who finds this man in their doorway, seeking shelter. Living in Yorkshire, in big cities such as Bradford and Leeds Armitage must have been well aware of people who have to endure these sort of ordeals and how they are so often ignored or dismissed."

The poem begins with the speaker describing how one night he saw “Eternity.” It appeared as a bright ring of light. He knew that all of time and space was within it. After looking upon it and realizing that God is the only thing worth valuing, he speaks on the various pursuits of humankind. The speaker tells of those who pine for earthly happiness and forget to nurse their spiritual health. He also depicts the terrible deeds of a “darksome statesman” who cares for no one but himself. This person, as well as many others like him, feeds off the suffering of others. Vaughan concludes the poem by describing the gluttonous among humankind and their preoccupation with food and wine. In the last lines, he attempts to persuade the reader to forget about the pleasures that can be gained on earth and focus on making it into Heaven."

a triangle of orange in the hollow of his cheek as a last flash of sunset
blazes the storefronts and lit windows of the street.
He is Asian, Thai or Vietnamese,
and very skinny, dressed as one of the poor in rumpled suit pants and a plaid mackinaw, dingy and too large.

In the first stanza of this poem, the poet begins by describing a Chicago street, an older man, and the peace and calm of his final experiences. The man is taking pleasure in the warmth of his laundry, collected within a paper bag, as he is shot on the street by an unknown boy. The boy gets away without any pedestrians in the vicinity pursuing him. These pedestrians also do nothing to help the wounded older man, who is, as the speaker notes, either Vietnamese, Thai, or Asian. His final words are likely spoken in his native language and are unintelligible and “mean nothing” to the pedestrians. The poem turns at this point, shifting to a first-person narrator who is in his room reading the philosophical works of René Descartes. He suggests that after hearing about this man's tragic death, he felt “ashamed” at his privilege and the general lack of empathy exhibited by everyday people."

It calls for grand monuments to be erected for those who have bestowed a celestial radiance upon existence, becoming almost angelic figures and offering time an enduring legacy. However, the poem takes a different perspective when it comes to Bryant, the poet of nature. It asserts that he doesn’t require monumental columns or structures to commemorate his greatness. Instead, his true monument is the very fabric of nature itself, an everlasting testament crafted by the hands of the divine. This monument of Bryant is not constructed by human hands; it is a creation of God’s own making. This monument is omnipresent, visible in the vast mountains, the flowing rivers, and wherever the roaring torrent creates a somber melody or delicate flower blossoms in the expansive grasslands. Bryant’s legacy is intertwined with the natural world, existing eternally as a part of its essence. The poem beautifully juxtaposes the ephemeral nature of human-built memorials with the timeless and omnipresent monument that nature itself becomes for the poet. In essence, the poem praises Bryant as a poet of nature whose profound connection to the natural world transcends the need for physical monuments. His true memorial is the entire universe around us, a monument that encapsulates his spirit, creativity, and appreciation for the beauty of existence. The poem captures the sentiment that nature is the ultimate tribute to Bryant’s poetic genius, a living and unending commemoration that surpasses any human-made tribute."

Each line in this poem is unusually short, and contains only one to four words. This line structure leads the readers to look at the next and then the next line to complete the action that had begun –of constructing the salad that is an essential part of the midday meal in South America and Western European countries, particularly Spain. Neruda starts with the season when tomatoes are in abundant supply; they “flow over” from the vegetable vendors' stalls and their colour, though not mentioned here, instantly attracts attention. When cut, the “two/tomato/halves” look like the two hemispheres to which Chile and Spain belong, the only difference being that it is summer in Chile in December (since it belongs to the Southern Hemisphere) and winter in Spain (since it belongs to the Northern Hemisphere). The tomato breaks its bonds and “invades/kitchen”, reminding us of another invasion where the American Indians succumbed to an almost silent takeover of their lands and their culture by the Spanish conquistadors, who came in the wake of Columbus. The poem thus carries profound political, social, and cultural connotations. It alternates between pure pictures of culinary delight and violence in the kitchen – the end of cutting the tomato reads like actual murder. Yet the tomato is an “inexhaustible sun” and it “beds cheerfully” with the other vegetables, especially the onion, pictured here as “blonde” when cut in rings. It appears that Neruda is here talking about the sexual union between the two races – the American (Red) Indians and the Europeans (whites) after the Spanish colonization of Chile). Again, the salad bowl with its olives and pimentos, suggests a cheerful blending of Chilean and Spanish cultures. The poet is convinced that the melting-pot culture of America has now been replaced by the salad bowl where all the colours can mix without any losing their original shape, form, individuality, or identity. Neruda's keen eye for detail describes “butter dishes, blue salt-cellars” waiting to be called into service while preparing the salad. He notes: “Oil the filial essence/of the olive tree” and a little later, “we have the day's wedding,” which recall images of domestic bliss. Towards the close of the ode, Neruda races ahead to the meal that beckons him with its aromas. There is a sense of immediacy when he writes, “it's time/let's go”. There is celebration and joy in partaking freshness”. It is a veritable comingling of diverse cultures, at least through the common denominator of food. Neruda considers the native South American culture like a tomato without any protective casing of fish and thorns that protected rose plants. That probably explains why it has been drowned in Western culture. It has become a veritable part of the salad that the Western colonizers enjoy with their midday meals. When we read 'Ode to Tomatoes', it seems that Neruda is expressing more about his heritage rather than the tomato or tomato festival. The tenor used is tomatoes. Again, a number of vehicles convey the message. Tomatoes are first found in the city, “The Street drowns in tomatoes”. The meaning of “drowns” in the first line of the poem is suffused by; that is, there is an abundance of tomatoes. Thereafter, Neruda makes use of descriptive words of season and time to carry the tomatoes through the year, “noon, summer light breaks in two tomato halves, and the streets run with juice. In December, the tomato cuts loose”—which means the tomato in this month of the year frees itself. The poet here employs the kitchen as a vehicle again with, “invades kitchens, takes over lunches” –here the meaning of invades is entered forcefully, while the meaning of takeover is controlling, exercising power and becoming supreme in the kitchen. This can further be further elaborated with the meaning that this time the tomato becomes the king of the kitchen. The tomato enlivens when carried by the salad, “floods the salads of Chile, beds cheerfully with the blonde onion, and to celebrate oil the filial essence of the olive tree allows itself to fall over its gaping hemispheres, the pimento further adds a zing of its fragrance, salt its magnetism”. At the end of the day, the tomato gets to its original form as part of the summer meal, “upon the table, belted by summer, tomatoes, and stars of the earth stars multiplied and fertile”. Neruda, in this ode, makes use of the vehicles to carry the subject through a little history of Chile, the land that he is in love with."

For instance, he refers to the stained wallpapers and the smell of old toilets. Furthermore, he suggests readers use metaphors.

The poem begins with the speaker describing a number of natural forces that continually act upon the city. Those who live within its limits are barraged by the force of the wind that is able to turn up dust storms, the “roar of the sun” that can reach one even when the star has set low in the sky, and the “biting” of the sea that has been pounding the coast for centuries. These elements all come together to create a dangerously hostile living environment. They are there to remind the residents that they are only temporarily in charge. The poem continues on to speak of the constant fight for survival in the city. Many are often regularly desperate for food and water, and even the city itself struggles to maintain its way of life. The poem concludes with the speaker noting that even though they have made a life there, the people of Karachi are always at the mercy of nature. It will always be there to remind them of their temporary rule."

1155,1166,1166,"A land, as far as the eye can see, where the waving grasses grow
Or the plains are blackened and burnt and bare, where the false mirages go

Land of the plenty or land of want, where the grey Companions dance,
Feast or famine, or hope or fear, and in all things land of chance,

And we catch a sound of a fairy's song, as the wind goes whipping by,
Or a scent like incense drifts along from the herbage ripe and dry
- Or the dust storms dance on their ballroom floor, where the bones of the cattle lie.","A land, as far as the eye can see, where the waving grasses grow","The poem The Plains by A.B. Paterson details about the several roles, played by an Austrian plain. The plains play different roles during different seasons. For example; in the spring season, there is ‘the waving grasses’, in the summer, they become so hot that a wildfire is erupted, and burn these plains unless they become bare. The plains turn into shady figures that are really hard to make out. On the other hand, in their second role, when these plains are in their full swing, they have plenty of foods for humans and animals, but as the season of winter comes, they go barren and dry. The poet says everything is destined; you never know what next the plains have in store for you. It is really hard to predict of plains’ next move. Here the poet describes how nature could be cruel and hard. It is cruel not only for the predators that satisfy their appetite by eating the smaller animals and rabbits but it is also cruel with human beings who are dependent on it. However, nature is also magical when it comes to outdoor breezes and smells. You would commonly find cows grazing, but this sight does not last for long. When there is summer with scorching heat, when there is drought, or when the winter dries these plains, the grazing cows turn into dead bodies, and their bones are found lying here and there in the same plains that once used to be grazing and feeding land for these animals."

The speaker, who is talking to the reader from beyond the grave, spends the poem complaining about his inadequacies when it comes to art. He tried all his life to make good art, but he never felt that he did anything worthwhile. This was only reinforced when he traveled to France or Italy. There, he says, he felt the draw and power of the old masters, but he was unable to tap into the skill for himself. He died, blaming Spoon River, his home, for his artistic inadequacies."

He says that he's sorry for any of the bad things he said about his white father in the past. He feels regret about them. He also regrets ever having said anything bad about their Black mother. He thinks of her in a much more loving light now. In the final stanza, the speaker notes that their father died in a nice home, and their mother died in a run-down house. He wonders if he'll die in a nice home or a dilapidated one considering that he's biracial."

And a thousand thousand slimy things

And drew my eyes away;
I looked upon the rotting deck,
And there the dead men lay.

The charmèd water burnt alway
A still and awful red.

Beyond the shadow of the ship,
I watched the water-snakes:
They moved in tracks of shining white,
And when they reared, the elfish light
Fell off in hoary flakes.

Within the shadow of the ship
I watched their rich attire:
Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,
They coiled and swam; and every track
Was a flash of golden fire.

A spring of love gushed from my heart,
And I blessed them unaware:
Sure my kind saint took pity on me,
And I blessed them unaware.

He expresses his concern that the mariner is also dead and is telling him the story as a ghost. The Mariner assures him this isn't the case. He was the only one to live through the ordeal. The Mariner goes back to the story and tells the Wedding Guest that solitude is the price he has to pay for his sins. He's surrounded by dead bodies and the ocean and feels quite sorry for himself. He tries to pray but is unable to. The bodies around him don't decay and time passes. Finally, he's able to pray at the end of this section and the albatross falls off his neck and into the ocean."

She expresses wonder at the “far country” they experience and the calm of their souls. The poem begins with an introduction of the journey on which the two are embarking. They are traveling somewhere quite distant from their homes. It is a place they have never before ventured and ideally, will provide them with experiences they have never before had. They are content with one another, so much so they do not need to exchange more than a few words. They know exactly the depths to which the other's soul is delving. As the poem continues the spiritual importance of the trip is emphasized. The man expresses to his companion that his soul has been considerably lightened and his stress decreased. He has found peace in the silence. The two travel for a time before lying down in the sand and watching the protective stars overhead. They have reached the pinnacle of their journey. Their thoughts have moved beyond the common to the transcendent."

She reveals what kindness feels like. To describe how to be kind, she points at the basic requirements. Firstly, a person has to be selfless and lose all the desires except the desire of spreading kindness. In the following sections, readers come across several images. Each image presents a respective idea. The depiction of an Indian white poncho reveals the connection of a person to that innocent victim.

Though, were it fruit, the blooms were gone,
Or, were it flowers, the dew.

“Take my share of a fickle heart,
Mine of a paltry love:
Take it or leave it as you will,
I wash my hands thereof.”

“And what you leave, ” said Nell, “I’ll take,
And what you spurn, I’ll wear;
For he’s my lord for better and worse,
And him I love Maude Clare.

“Yea, though you’re taller by the head,
More wise and much more fair:
I’ll love him till he loves me best,
Me best of all Maude Clare.","“Son Thomas, ” his lady mother said, With smiles, almost with tears","As a form of literature, poetry is an art form that can go into incredible detail to tell stories and share experiences in a way that can be both relatable and completely detached from the reader. A poet is a storyteller in many ways, and Christina Rossetti takes this role very literally in Maude Clare, combining the two forms into a poem that incorporates setting, style, and multiple characters alongside typical poetic conventions. The limitation of using a poem to tell a story, of course, is in the stylistic limitations of the form; Rossetti needs to choose her words carefully and make each line impactful to convey as much story as she can in these short verses, and yet she does so extremely well. Another interesting point of Maude Clare is that it offers insight into the time from which it was written. Rossetti lived during the latter half of the nineteenth century in England, and she was a very popular poet of her time. Such a poem as this one, therefore, serves as a unique gateway into a time period long passed and provides the reader with insight into the values, movements, and ideals of its time. In all, Maude Clare is a uniquely interesting work with both an interesting story and a historic context that helps it to stand out from Rossetti’s many famous works."

Ramanujan describes the aftermath of a father's death and all the things he left behind, physical and emotional. The poem begins with the speaker telling the reader that his father died. When he died, he left behind a lot. There are unless and meaningless things, like dust and old papers. But there are also memories and rituals which are going to last a lifetime. In the second half of the poem, the speaker describes how they cremated this father and threw his leftover bones into the river. He also speaks about something he learned but is yet to see with his own eyes. Apparently, his father left an obituary in a local paper. Now, the son is searching the most popular papers for it, hoping to see this other thing he left behind. The poem ends with an emphasis on the importance of the rituals that came from his father and are now established parts of family life."

Since","'Shall earth no more inspire thee' by Emily Brontë is made up of one person's impassioned plea to another. The speaker is asking her listener to return to worshiping and loving the earth. The poem begins with the speaker asking her listener if they are stuck in a dark place within their mind. She wants to know if they are no longer inspired to action by the beauties of the earth and are instead stuck in “lonely” contemplation. The speaker goes on to describe how things once were. She knows the love that the listener once held for the earth, and uses everything she can to get this person to emerge from their hiding place and once more “bow” before nature. The speaker makes clear, as the poem progresses, that she, the earth, is the only one who can appeal to the listener's emotions. Therefore, he/she should come back and “dwell” alongside and inside the warmth of the earth."

The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,
The plowman homeward plods his weary way,
And leaves the world to darkness and to me.
Now fades the glimm'ring landscape on the sight,
And all the air a solemn stillness holds,
Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,
And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;
Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'r
The moping owl does to the moon complain
Of such, as wand'ring near her secret bow'r,
Molest her ancient solitary reign.
Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,
Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap,
Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,
The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.
The breezy call of incense-breathing Morn,
The swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed,
The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,
No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.
For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,
Or busy housewife ply her evening care:
No children run to lisp their sire's return,
Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.
Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,
Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;
How jocund did they drive their team afield!
How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!
Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,
Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;
Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile
The short and simple annals of the poor.
The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r,
And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,
Awaits alike th' inevitable hour.
The paths of glory lead but to the grave.
Nor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault,
If Mem'ry o'er their tomb no trophies raise,
Where thro' the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault
The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.
Can storied urn or animated bust
Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?
Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,
Or Flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of Death?
Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid
Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;
Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,
Or wak'd to ecstasy the living lyre.
But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page
Rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll;
Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage,
And froze the genial current of the soul.
Full many a gem of purest ray serene,
The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:
Full many a flow'r is born to blush unseen,
And waste its sweetness on the desert air.
Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast
The little tyrant of his fields withstood;
Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,
Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.
Th' applause of list'ning senates to command,
The threats of pain and ruin to despise,
To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,
And read their hist'ry in a nation's eyes,
Their lot forbade: nor circumscrib'd alone
Their growing virtues, but their crimes confin'd;
Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,
And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,
The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,
To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,
Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride
With incense kindled at the Muse's flame.
Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,
Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;
Along the cool sequester'd vale of life
They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.
Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect,
Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,
Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.
Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,
The place of fame and elegy supply:
And many a holy text around she strews,
That teach the rustic moralist to die.
For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,
This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
Nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind?
On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,
Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires.
For thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead
Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;
If chance, by lonely contemplation led,
Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,
Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,
""Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn
Brushing with hasty steps the dews away
To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.
""There at the foot of yonder nodding beech
That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,
His listless length at noontide would he stretch,
And pore upon the brook that babbles by.
""Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,
Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,
Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,
Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.

Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree;
Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;

Slow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne.
Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay,
Grav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn.""
THE EPITAPH

A youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.
Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,
And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.
Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:
He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.

Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,
(There they alike in trembling hope repose)
The bosom of his Father and his God.","The curfew tolls the knell of parting day, The low","Gray's “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,” presents the omniscient speaker who talks to the reader. First, he stands alone in a graveyard deep in thought. While there, he thinks about the dead people buried there. The graveyard referred to here is the graveyard of the church in Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire. The speaker contemplates the end of human life throughout the poem. He remarks on the inevitability of death that every individual has to face. Besides mourning the loss of someone, the speaker in the elegy reminds the reader that all people will die one day. Death is an unavoidable and natural thing in everyone's life. When one dies today, tomorrow, a stranger will see the person's tombstone. Out of curiosity, he will ask about the person buried there to a villager. The villager will reply that he knew the man. He would add that he had seen him in various spots. Sometimes, he will also remark that he had stopped seeing the man one day, and then there was the tombstone. In the poem, Gray, the poet himself, writes the epitaph of his own. He says that his life is full of sadness and depression. However, he feels proud of his knowledge. He calls it incomparable. In addition to this, he says that 'No one is perfect in this world.' So, he asks the reader not to judge anyone in the graveyard. Each and every soul is different and takes rest for eternity in the graveyard. In conclusion, the poet, through the speaker, ends the elegy by saying that death is an inevitable event in this world. Also, he says that man's efforts and his struggles to succeed in life comes to an end in death. Thus, death conquers man regardless of his successes and/or failures in his endeavors during his life.

He discovers that physical contact such as handshakes become a thing of the past, the uncertainty surrounding other people being a risk people are not willing to take in these new conditions. As much as this poem is about health risks, the focus of Pandemania is more so about human social behavior, pointing out fallacies and little changes that reflect the innate fear people have of becoming sick. Halpern concludes that a health pandemic changes people, making them more hostile to strangers and alienating others in their drive for perfect health."

His poetic persona directly converses with it by investing it with human attributes. He reminds the flower of how it hunched up before spreading its petals. Then a time came when it bloomed fully. He connects himself to the full-grown flower and finds it quite inspiring to think about how the world looks at it. It makes him feel alive and honored. Lastly, the speaker creates a contrast between himself and the “patient flower.”"

Lawrence uses the personal voice of a speaker to describe a storm in most vivid detail. This particular storm happens to be one that Lawrence saw while he was in the Black Forest (hence, the title) when he visited the forest in 1929, the year before he died. That reveals that this is one of the last poems and Lawrence ever wrote. The nature of Storm in the Black Forest is such that it makes the readers feel how truly vulnerable mankind is. The speaker in this poem does not claim to have any kind of control over nature. Rather, he scoffs at that idea and describes the storm in such a way as to make the readers feel that humanity is entirely at the mercies of nature. It is interesting, then, that he wrote this only a year before his death."

The poem begins with the speaker talking directly to a man that has passed on from this life and returned to it in one form or another. The man was most likely her husband, and now that he has returned, he is able to walk all of his old paths and make her feel as she did while he was still alive. While the speaker describes the man as being ghost-like, but it is more likely that the idea of his continued existence is cheering the speaker. His good deeds, and happy nature live on in the house.

He builds a fire, gets the knife ready, and is prepared to kill him. An angel comes down and tells him that instead of killing his son he should kill “The Ram of Pride.” Abraham surprisingly refuses in this version of the story and kills his son “And half the seed of Europe, one by one.”"

The poem begins with the speaker asking what “it” means. He is trying to figure out the balance in his life and how beauty influences it. In the day to day annoyances of life he does not find any beauty. He often feels “Tired, angry and ill at ease.” The speaker is likely to look down on his own life and feel useless. This is a state that is remedied by taking a step back from his own depression and moving out into the natural world, at least mentally. There, he is able to leave behind his worries and feel like he is one with every other living thing."

It is likely that the speaker and Timothy Thomas Fortune are one and the same, considering where they both spent most of their lives. The speaker professes to love Poe, even in the writer's darker moments. As the text continues the speaker's praise of Poe becomes more grandiose and romanticized. He celebrates the path Poe tried his best to walk during his lifetime and the skill of his song. The poem concludes with the speaker acknowledging that Poe is dead.

The speaker also emphasizes that germs love to live in the human body. He speaks directly to the listener, a young child, in the second stanza.

The spectator watches the corps march towards their victory as if it is inevitable. The overall tone of the poem is fatigued and exhausted, yet filled with a nationalistic vigor. The spectator views the war with a settled conviction that will keep going for a long time. That is why Whitman ends the piece with the statement, “As the army corps advances.”"

New and cleanly it was the sun's clarion
Executives laborers exquisite stenographers
Criss-cross Monday through Saturday four times daily
Three times every morning sirens groan
At the lunch hour a rabid bell barks

Dressed by your mother in blue and white only

Nothing is more fun than Masses and Litanies

You pray all night in the school chapel

Behold the red-haired torch inextinguishable
Behold the pale son and scarlet of the dolorous Mother
Behold the tree forever tufted with prayer
Behold the double gallows honor and eternity
Behold the six-pointed star
Behold the God who dies on Friday and rises on Sunday
Behold the Christ who flies higher than aviators
He holds the world's record for altitude

Twentieth pupil of the centuries knows its stuff
And bird-changed this century like Jesus climbs the sky

In the Dark Ages you would have entered a monastery
You are ashamed to overhear yourself praying
You laugh at yourself and the laughter crackles like hellfire
The sparks gild the ground and background of your life
Your life is a painting in a dark museum
And sometimes you examine it closely

You are walking in Paris the women are bloodsoaked
It was and I have no wish to remember it was the end of beauty

In Chartres from her entourage of flames Our Lady beamed at me
The blood of your Sacred Heart drenched me in Montmartre
I'm sick of hearing blissful promises
The love I feel is a venereal disease
And the image possessing you in your pain your insomnia
Vanishes and it is always near you

And now you are on the Riviera
Under lemon trees that never stop blooming
You are boating with friends
One is from Nice one is from Menton two from La Turbie
We are staring terrified at giant squid
At fish the symbols of Jesus swimming through seaweed

You are in the garden at an inn outside of Prague
You are completely happy a rose is on the table
And instead of getting on with your short-story
You watch the rosebug sleeping in the rose's heart

Appalled you see yourself reproduced in the agates of Saint Vitus
You were sad near to death to see yourself there
You looked as bewildered as Lazarus
In the Jewish ghetto the clock runs backwards
And you go backwards also through a slow life
Climbing the Hradchen listening at nightfall
To Bohemian songs in the singing taverns

You in Marseilles among the watermelons

You in Coblenz at the Hotel Gigantic

You in Rome beneath a Japanese tree

You in Amsterdam with a girl you find pretty who is ugly
She's engaged to marry a student from Leyden
Where you can rent rooms in Latin Cubicula locanda
I remember spending three days there and three in Gouda

You are in Paris hauled before the magistrate
You are under arrest you are a criminal now

You went on sorrowful and giddy travels
Ignorant still of dishonesty and old age
Love afflicted you at twenty and again at thirty
I've lived like a fool and I've wasted my time
You dare not look at your hands I want to weep all the time
On you on the one I love on everything that frightened you

And now you are crying at the sight of refugees
Who believe in God who pray whose women nurse babies
The hall of the train station is filled with the refugee-smell
Like the Magi refugees believe in their star
They expect to find silver mines in the Argentine
And to return like kings to their abandoned countries
One family carries a red eiderdown you carry your heart
Eiderdown and dreams are equally fantastic

Some of the refugees stay on in Paris settling
Into slums on the rue des Rosiers or the rue des Ecouffes
I have seen them often at dusk they breathe at their doorways
They budge from home as reluctantly as chessmen
They are chiefly Jewish the women wear wigs
And haunt backrooms of little shops in little chairs

You're standing at the metal counter of some dive
Drinking wretched coffee where the wretched live

You are in a cavernous restaurant at night

These women are not evil they are used-up regretful
Each has tormented someone even the ugliest

She is the daughter of a police sergeant from Jersey

Her hands I'd never noticed are hard and cracked

My pity aches along the seams of her belly

I humble my mouth to her grotesque laughter

You're alone when morning comes
The milkmen jingle bottles in the street

Night beautiful courtesan the night withdraws
Fraudulent Ferdine or careful Leah

And you drink an alcohol as caustic as your life
Your life you drink as alcohol

You walk to Auteuil you want to go on foot to sleep
At home among your South Sea and Guinean fetishes
Christs of another shape another faith
Subordinate Christs of uncertain hopes

Goodbye Goodbye

Sun cut throated", A beautiful street in Paris is a beautiful street in Paris.</s,"'Zone' by Guillaume Apollinaire describes a walk through Paris that spans an entire day, from sunup to sunup. The poem begins with the speaker setting off on his journey at the start of a new day. The initial language gives the city, Paris, an anthropomorphized control over itself. The Eiffel Tower is a shepherd and the bridges sheep. The narrator walks through the streets of the town and as he travels he gets closer and closer to the side of life he has little experience of. He sees the women of the streets, and the poor refugees who, like the “Magi” are traveling on faith alone. Throughout the city, he sees sights that remind him of the convergence of birds and varied experiences he has had with women, positive and negative. He spends a substantial amount of time discussing prostitutes and the various cities in which he has encountered them. In the final lines, he reaches the end of his journey but is still full of “uncertain” feelings. He goes to sleep after stating that the sun will be decapitated by the land. It is beginning to rise, and appears like a head floating on the horizon. You can the full poem Zone here."

And blow the birds about the sky;
And all around I heard you pass,

In the poem's first stanza, the speaker describes how he saw the wind tossing kites in the sky and blowing birds around. Despite being unable to physically see the wind, the speaker keeps tabs on it. He could feel it “push” and hear it “call.” In the final stanza, this speaker asks the wind several questions about its form. He wonders if it is a beast of the field or “just a stronger child than me.”"
1181,1192,1192,"The force that through the green fuse drives the flower
Drives my green age; that blasts the roots of trees
Is my destroyer.
And I am dumb to tell the crooked rose
My youth is bent by the same wintry fever.

The force that drives the water through the rocks
Drives my red blood; that dries the mouthing streams
Turns mine to wax.
And I am dumb to mouth unto my veins
How at the mountain spring the same mouth sucks.

The hand that whirls the water in the pool
Stirs the quicksand; that ropes the blowing wind
Hauls my shroud sail.
And I am dumb to tell the hanging man
How of my clay is made the hangman's lime.

The lips of time leech to the fountain head;
Love drips and gathers, but the fallen blood
Shall calm her sores.
And I am dumb to tell a weather's wind
How time has ticked a heaven round the stars.

And I am dumb to tell the lover's tomb
How at my sheet goes the same crooked worm.",The force that through the green fuse drives the flower Drives my green age; that blasts,"‘The force that through the green fuse drives the flower’ by Dylan Thomas is a complex poem that uses an extended metaphor to speak about the themes of time, life, and love.

The poem takes the reader through a number of scenarios in which the speaker compares himself to other forms of life. He speaks about a power in his body that moves his blood but that also moves the water in rivers and stirs quicksand. It is a force that has the ability to destroy life and to remake it. Throughout the text he uses a refrain: “And I am dumb,” to express his inability to communicate with these other elements of the world and convey to them the nature of time. But, in the end, he admits that nature is impossible to understand."

Or wounded in a mentionable place.
You worship decorations; you believe
That chivalry redeems the war's disgrace.
You make us shells. You listen with delight,
By tales of dirt and danger fondly thrilled.
You crown our distant ardours while we fight,
And mourn our laurelled memories when we're killed.
You can't believe that British troops “retire”
When hell's last horror breaks them, and they run,
Trampling the terrible corpses—blind with blood.

While you are knitting socks to send your son
His face is trodden deeper in the mud.","You love us when we're heroes, home on leave, Or wounded in a mention","In 'Glory of Women,' Sassoon lists the many actions taken by women in the name of patriotism and victory and finds them both toxic and hollow. He sees no point in the “laurelled memories” that women will cherish when soldiers are dying horrifically, without any of the honor, “glory” or “chivalry” women dream about while “knitting socks” and making “shells.”"

Throughout the fourteen lines of 'Sonnet 101,' the speaker addresses his muse. He chastises the lack of inspiration he's been receiving lately in regards to his beloved, the Fair Youth. He wants to know what's going on and demands that she provide him with an explanation. In the second quatrain, he proposes some possible explanations but doesn't like any of them. Finally, the poem concludes with the speaker telling her that she's needed so that they might immortalize the youth together."

The poem portrays a different perspective, as the world is seen through the baby’s eyes. Thus, the poem introduces the baby’s perceptions and feelings in order to vividly portray a child’s mind a few moments after being born.‘Baby Song’ builds two main spaces that contain contrasting images. On one hand, there is the womb, the inside, where the baby feels safe and protected. On the other hand, there is the room, the outside, where the child is uncomfortable and feels in danger constantly."

(You never know what troubled little girl needs a book)
At a time when there was not tv before 3:00 P.M.
And on Sunday none until 5:00
We sat on the front porches watching
The jfg sign go on and off greeting
The neighbors, discussion the political
Situation congratulating the preacher
On his sermon
There was always the radio which brought us
Songs from wlac in nashville and what we would now call
Easy listening or smooth jazz but when I listened
Late at night with my portable (that I was so proud of)
Tucked under my pillow
I heard nat king cole and matt dennis, june christy and ella fitzgerald
And sometimes sarah vaughan sing black coffee
Which I now drink
It was just called music
There was a bookstore uptown on gay street
Which I visited and inhaled that wonderful odor
Of new books
Even today I read hardcover as a preference paperback only
As a last resort
And up the hill on vine street
(The main black corridor) sat our carnegie library
Mrs. Long always glad to see you
The stereoscope always ready to show you faraway
Places to dream about
Mrs. Long asking what are you looking for today
When I wanted Leaves of Grass or alfred north whitehead
She would go to the big library uptown and I now know
Hat in hand to ask to borrow so that I might borrow
Probably they said something humiliating since southern
Whites like to humiliate southern blacks

But she nonetheless brought the books
Back and I held them to my chest
Close to my heart
And happily skipped back to grandmother’s house
Where I would sit on the front porch
In a gray glider and dream of a world
Far away
I love the world where I was
I was safe and warm and grandmother gave me neck kissed
When I was on my way to bed
But there was a world
Somewhere
Out there
And Mrs. Long opened that wardrobe
But no lions or witches scared me
I went through
Knowing there would be
Spring","A Poem for My Librarian, Mrs. Long (You never know what trouble","'A Poem For My Librarian, Mrs. Long' is a biographical sketch of Nikki Giovanni's childhood in 1950s Tennessee. Giovanni describes what it was like to be a child during this time; television was limited, so the family would often rely on the radio, which Giovanni would often sneak into her bedroom to listen to some of her favorite artists: Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, and others. Giovanni would also entertain herself at the local bookstore and the library, where her librarian, Mrs. Long, would ask her what she was looking for. Mrs. Long would often have to walk to the white library to ask for books not housed at the black library, and Giovanni ruminates on the fact that Mrs. Long probably faced ridicule every time. While Giovanni's grandmother provided the girl with safety and security, Mrs. Long gave her a faraway world that could only be found within a book."

He repeats the story over and over, never going over the actual messages. The poem at once paints a mind destroyed by witnessing the horrors of war, and also presents the monotonous narrative of war – with pain begetting pain."
1187,1198,1198,"We sat together at one summer’s end,
That beautiful mild woman, your close friend, And you and I, and talked of poetry.
I said, ‘A line will take us hours maybe;
Yet if it does not seem a moment’s thought, Our stitching and unstitching has been naught. Better go down upon your marrow-bones And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather; For to articulate sweet sounds together
Is to work harder than all these, and yet Be thought an idler by the noisy set
Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen The martyrs call the world.’
And thereupon
That beautiful mild woman for whose sake There’s many a one shall find out all heartache On finding that her voice is sweet and low Replied, ‘To be born woman is to know—
Although they do not talk of it at school—
That we must labour to be beautiful.’
I said, ‘It’s certain there is no fine thing Since Adam’s fall but needs much labouring.
There have been lovers who thought love should be So much compounded of high courtesy That they would sigh and quote with learned looks Precedents out of beautiful old books; Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.’
We sat grown quiet at the name of love; We saw the last embers of daylight die, And in the trembling blue-green of the sky A moon, worn as if it had been a shell Washed by time’s waters as they rose and fell About the stars and broke in days and years.
I had a thought for no one’s but your ears: That you were beautiful, and that I strove To love you in the old high way of love;
That it had all seemed happy, and yet we’d grown As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.","I had a thought for no one’s but your ears: That you were beautiful,","'Adam's Curse' by William Butler Yeats is a moving poem about the presence, or lack thereof, of beauty and true love in the world. The poem takes place on a summer's day, awards the end of the season. Three friends, including the speaker, are outside talking about poetry, hard work, and beauty. The speaker describes how as a poet no one understands how hard it is to write. He thinks that it would actually be easier to be a laborer. Then, at least, he wouldn't have to be called “idle” by schoolmasters and bankers. As the poem continues one of the speaker's companions adds that it is also very hard work to be a woman and be beautiful. This leads the speaker to consider love and the way love has transformed over the centuries. The poem ends on a solemn note as the speaker reveals his love for the intended listener of the poem."
1188,1199,1199,"She wanted a little room for thinking;
but she saw diapers steaming on the line,
a doll slumped behind the door.
So she lugged a chair behind the garage
to sit out the children’s naps.
Sometimes there were things to watch –
the pinched armor of a vanished cricket,
a floating maple leaf. Other days
she stared until she was assured
when she closed her eyes
she’d see only her own vivid blood.
She had an hour, at best, before Liza appeared
pouting from the top of the stairs.
And just what was mother doing
out back with the field mice? Why,
building a palace. Later
that night when Thomas rolled over and
lurched into her, she would open her eyes
and think of the place that was hers
for an hour – where
she was nothing,
pure nothing, in the middle of the day."," Mother was a little girl, but she was a little girl.</s","'Daystar' by Rita Dove describes the hour of peace and nothingness that a mother and wife has to herself during the day. The speaker spends the lines of this poem taking the reader through the moments surrounding a woman's favorite time of the day. It's not one that brings her joy or pleasure. But, it is one that brings her silence and nothingness. When her children are sleeping, she can sit outside behind the garage and stare at the soft movements of the natural world or at nothing at all. It's this time of day she casts herself back to when she deals with her children and husband at other points during the day."

The speaker addresses himself as “a tree” and considers how his newly influenced perspective on the world as informed by these stories and the natural spaces around him.

1191,1202,1202,"Every Who down in Whoville liked Christmas a lot.
But the Grinch who lived just North of Whoville did not!

The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!
Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.

It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight.
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.

But I think that the most likely reason of all
May have been that his heart was two sizes too small.


But, whatever the reason, his heart or his shoes,
He stood there on Christmas Eve hating the Whos,

Staring down from his cave with a sour, Grinchy frown
At the warm lighted windows below in their town,

For he knew every Who down in Whoville beneath
Was busy now hanging a hollywho wreath.

""And they're hanging their stockings,"" he snarled with a sneer.
""Tomorrow is Christmas! It's practically here!""

Then he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming,
""I must find some way to keep Christmas from coming!

For, tomorrow, I know all the Who girls and boys
Will wake bright and early. They'll rush for their toys!

And then! Oh, the noise! Oh, the noise! Noise! Noise! Noise!
There's one thing I hate! All the NOISE! NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!

They'll stand close together, with Christmas bells ringing.
They'll stand hand-in-hand, and those Whos will start singing!""

And the more the Grinch thought of this Who Christmas Sing,
The more the Grinch thought, ""I must stop this whole thing!

Why for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!
I must stop Christmas from coming! But how?""

Then he got an idea! An awful idea!
The Grinch got a wonderful, awful idea!

""I know just what to do!"" The Grinch laughed in his throat.
""I'll make a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat.""

""This is stop number one,"" the old Grinchy Claus hissed,
As he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist.

Then he slid down the chimney, a rather tight pinch.
But if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch.

He got stuck only once, for a minute or two.
Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue

Where the little Who stockings hung all in a row.
""These stockings,"" he grinched, ""are the first things to go!""

Then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant,
Around the whole room, and he took every present!

[...]

It was quarter of dawn. All the Whos still a-bed,
All the Whos still a-snooze, when he packed up his sled,

Packed it up with their presents, their ribbons, their wrappings,
Their snoof and their fuzzles, their tringlers and trappings!

Ten thousand feet up, up the side of Mount Crumpet,
He rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it!

""Pooh-pooh to the Whos!"" he was grinchily humming.
""They're finding out now that no Christmas is coming!

They're just waking up! I know just what they'll do!
Their mouths will hang open a minute or two
Then the Whos down in Whoville will all cry boo-hoo!

That's a noise,"" grinned the Grinch, ""that I simply must hear!""
He paused, and the Grinch put a hand to his ear.

And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.
It started in low, then it started to grow.

But this sound wasn't sad!
Why, this sound sounded glad!

Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,
Was singing without any presents at all!

He hadn't stopped Christmas from coming! It came!
Somehow or other, it came just the same!

And the Grinch, with his grinch feet ice-cold in the snow,
Stood puzzling and puzzling. ""How could it be so?

It came without ribbons! It came without tags!
It came without packages, boxes, or bags!""

He puzzled and puzzed till his puzzler was sore.
Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before.

Maybe Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store.
Maybe Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more!

And what happened then? Well, in Whoville they say
That the Grinch's small heart grew three sizes that day!

And then the true meaning of Christmas came through,
And the Grinch found the strength of ten Grinches, plus two!

And now that his heart didn't feel quite so tight,
He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light

With a smile to his soul, he descended Mount Crumpet
Cheerily blowing ""Who! Who!"" on his trumpet.

He rode into Whoville. He brought back their toys.
He brought back their floof to the Who girls and boys.

He brought back their snoof and their tringlers and fuzzles,
Brought back their pantookas, their dafflers and wuzzles.

He brought everything back, all the food for the feast!
And he, he himself, the Grinch carved the roast beast!

Welcome Christmas. Bring your cheer,
Cheer to all Whos, far and near.

The poem begins with the speaker telling his lover that although he swore to love her twelve hours ago, he no longer does. This commitment was not a real one. It was only something he said in passing, on a whim. Clearly, the lover did not feel the same way. She believed he was genuine and he spends the rest of the poem trying to explain his position. He is choosing to leave her, not because she isn't beautiful, but because he wants to seek out more gems, or women, like a “minerallist.” By the time the speaker gets to the end of the poem, he has informed the listener that he might return to her if he gets bored with the variety the world has to offer."

Can I see","‘On Another’s Sorrow’ by William Blake describes the love God has for the world and how it has inspired the speaker to act similarly. The poem begins with the speaker asking his listener if there is any way he could not empathize with someone who is suffering. The clear answer to this question is no. A reader should infer immediately that the questions are rhetorical in nature and Blake’s speaker is simply trying to make a point about how integral pity is to his treatment of those grieving. In the second half, he turns to God and how he interacts with the world. He is able to become all those who suffer and sit by those who are in the depths of despair, no matter who they are. His care reaches down to the smallest beings. The poem concludes with the speaker telling the reader it should be impossible for one to be sad with all these instances of God’s joy."

She purposely makes the poem complex through linguistic manipulation, suggesting that she doesn't want to openly admit her feelings, trying to hide her love altogether. Be it from embarrassment, or simply not wanting to say that she loves this person, Millay uses this poem to cleverly beat around the bush, never fully admitting her love, only implying it heavily. A shy love poem, but a love poem nonetheless."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is obsessed with “flesh.” There is a whole group of young women he sees all the time. Every one of them drives him crazy. He wants to touch their “flesh” but is unable. He asks God to rid him of his desire. In the next lines, he describes cycling through town and finding bikes leaning against bushes. Lovers hid inside the hedge doing what he can't, and he knows it. He becomes enraged and shouts at them (and at his emotions), demanding that they leave him alone. The poem concludes with the speaker wishing that the “flaxen” hair of those he lusts after would become dust in his mind. This way he'd be able to forget about the girls playing tennis, biking, and walking. "
1197,1208,1208,"There’s just no accounting for happiness,
or the way it turns up like a prodigal
who comes back to the dust at your feet
having squandered a fortune far away.
And how can you not forgive?
You make a feast in honor of what
was lost, and take from its place the finest
garment, which you saved for an occasion
you could not imagine, and you weep night and day
to know that you were not abandoned,
that happiness saved its most extreme form
for you alone.
No, happiness is the uncle you never
knew about, who flies a single-engine plane

into town, and inquires at every door
until he finds you asleep midafternoon
as you so often are during the unmerciful
hours of your despair.
It comes to the monk in his cell.
It comes to the woman sweeping the street
with a birch broom, to the child
whose mother has passed out from drink.
It comes to the lover, to the dog chewing
a sock, to the pusher, to the basketmaker,
and to the clerk stacking cans of carrots
in the night.
It even comes to the boulder
in the perpetual shade of pine barrens,
to rain falling on the open sea,
to the wineglass, weary of holding wine.","Happiness is the uncle you never knew about, who flies a single-engine","'Happiness' by Jane Kenyon speaks on the nature of happiness and uses metaphors to compare it to mysterious traveling figures and lost relatives. The poem begins with the speaker comparing the emotion of happiness to a “prodigal” who has been gone for a long time but has finally returned. Rather than scorning the lost relative for its disappearance, “you” embrace it as you would happiness. The next comparison is similar, suggesting that happiness is an unknown uncle who while going house to house looking for somewhere to spend the night stumbles upon your own. The last lines describe how happiness comes to everyone, from the dog to the woman cleaning the street. Even, the last lines state, to a boulder and a weary wine glass."
1198,1209,1209,"Call out. Call loud: ‘I’m ready! Come and find me!’
The sacks in the toolshed smell like the seaside.
They’ll never find you in this salty dark,
But be careful that your feet aren’t sticking out.

And here they are, whispering at the door;

Come and find me!’ The,"'Hide and Seek' by Vernon Scannell uses the game as an extended metaphor to depict apprehension and desires of growing up and seizing opportunities. The poem starts off in the voice of the child. It seems as though perhaps the child is now much older and wiser, looking back at the memory of this game and speaking to himself, advising himself. Lines one through eight display the excitement of the child as well as a detailed account of his surroundings (the tool shed that smells of the seaside). We learn that he is calling out to his friends to come to find him. He figures he will never be found in this “salty dark[ness]” and makes sure to hide properly. He also reminds himself to be quiet and still, so he is not found easily. Lines nine through twelve discuss his state when the other children are so close to finding him. He can hear their voices “whispering at the door” of the tool shed. They linger there for a bit while the hidden child can hear their hushed voices laughing and muttering to each other. Here, the child then instructs himself to be still and “hide” in his “blindness” to ensure the other children do not realize that his whereabouts are so close. Finally, they decide to leave the area outside the tool shed. Lines thirteen through nineteen describe the child's wait, as he decides that the other children must be searching for him “puzzled” and declaring that he is quite “clever” for being able to find such a good hiding spot. Nonetheless, he starts to notice that they've been gone a “long time,” and he himself is getting tired of hiding as he realizes how cold and “stiff” he is. He can also now feel “the smell of sand” moving to his throat. Lines twenty through twenty-three show the child declaring himself the “winner” and deciding it was time the others recognized him for it. The last three lines: twenty-four to twenty-six, conclude the poem by revealing that “nothing stirs as he realizes he has been left behind. None of the other children were there looking for him."

In the beginning, the speaker describes how sculptors essentially fight with time to carve stone. Their work requires long hours of patience and perseverance. It shows the integrity of the stone-cutters, who seek to leave a mark on the world. In the following lines, the speaker describes how poets and stone-cutters get “cynical earnings” – money that is purely made for the sake of living. The speaker is aware that those things do not leave a lasting mark in this world. In the last few lines, he talks about how the poets build their monuments “mockingly like the sculptor.” This line hints at the fact that words and stone live past mortal human beings and survive till eternity. In the end, Jeffers realizes that the sun, the earth, and people all will eventually die, yet stone and words live for thousands of years."

Yeats tells the story of a man who is traveling to a new country, Byzantium, a spiritual resort to him. Byzantium was an ancient Greek colony later named Constantinople, which is situated where Istanbul, Turkey, now stands. While the speaker does take an actual journey to Byzantium, the reader can interpret this journey as a metaphorical one, perhaps representing the journey of the artist. In the poem, the speaker feels the country in which he resides is no place for the old—it is only welcoming to the young and promising. The speaker thus decides to travel to Byzantium, and later, to eternity, where age is not an issue, and he will be able to transcend his physical life. Discover more William Butler Yeats poems."

The poem begins by describing the new improvements being made to the local infrastructure but these improvements only bring the subsequently revealed damages into focus. The poem thereby focuses on the real, tangible process of rebuilding a nation that had suffered terrible conflict rather than merely addressing the speeches and decrees that were in the news at the time. The poem goes on to lament these words, especially when they are not accompanied by actions. As the stanzas progress, the tone grows increasingly abstract as it ponders what it means to be moderate in an environment that demands partisan behavior. The poem ends with a degree of cynicism as the narrator doubts whether the same people who waged violence are capable of sustaining peace."

In the first stanza of the poem, the speaker begins by stating that everyone suddenly “burst out singing.” This was an unplanned burst of joy at the end of World War I. Everyone was filled with unimaginable delight, knowing that the horrors of the period were over. The speaker goes on to say that the beauty of everyone's singing voices, lifted from the darkness of war, was “like the setting sun.” The speaker, too, was shaking with tears knowing that the pain had drifted away. The poem concludes with the speaker stating that the “singing will never be done.”"

Christopher Logue, Professor Tucholsky's Facts

A rail journey westwards is a good place to start,
the country on rewind or fast forward, depending on your seat,
throws up sightings which get more frequent


as the train nears the sea - our flag, strung up on bunting,
hung like wet washing in back yards that echo themselves
down the terraces' hall of mirrors.

Or on the flat end wall of a Swansea gym,
fading to the east where an occasional sun
has ghosted the paint to a bad photocopy.

Or tied to the side of a SNAX caravan,
throwing fits on its pole, high in the motorway wind,
the beast of it struggling to exist.

And so suitable, that dragon,
the currency of legend, the tale
that is truer in its fiction than the facts can ever be:

an old country pulsing to be young
and blessed with a blind spot bigger than itself,
and of course with this flag,

spawning itself west, a strange flower that flourishes best
in the barest of places, or glimpsed above a town hall
on a horizontal pole, wrapped up in itself

A Chinese burn of red white and green,
a tourniquet, a bandage tight on the wound
staunching the dreams of what might have been.","The flag, the currency of legend, is a symbol of the country's youth an","Flag by Owen Sheers tells the narrative of a train journey, with several sightings of the Welsh flag causing Sheers to reflect on the deterioration of the country.

they couldn’t. And carried the Pittsburgh Courier and the Chicago
Defender to the Black Americans in the South so they would
know they were not alone. This is for the Pullman Porters who
helped Thurgood Marshall go south and come back north to fight
the fight that resulted in Brown v. Board of Education because
even though Kansas is west and even though Topeka is the birth-
place of Gwendolyn Brooks, who wrote the powerful “The
Chicago Defender Sends a Man to Little Rock,” it was the
Pullman Porters who whispered to the traveling men both
the Blues Men and the “Race” Men so that they both would
know what was going on. This is for the Pullman Porters who
smiled as if they were happy and laughed like they were tickled
when some folks were around and who silently rejoiced in 1954
when the Supreme Court announced its 9—0 decision that “sepa-
rate is inherently unequal.” This is for the Pullman Porters who
smiled and welcomed a fourteen-year-old boy onto their train in
1955. They noticed his slight limp that he tried to disguise with a
doo-wop walk; they noticed his stutter and probably understood
why his mother wanted him out of Chicago during the summer
when school was out. Fourteen-year-old Black boys with limps
and stutters are apt to try to prove themselves in dangerous ways
when mothers aren’t around to look after them. So this is for the
Pullman Porters who looked over that fourteen-year-old while
the train rolled the reverse of the Blues Highway from Chicago to
St. Louis to Memphis to Mississippi. This is for the men who kept
him safe; and if Emmett Till had been able to stay on a train all
summer he would have maybe grown a bit of a paunch, certainly
lost his hair, probably have worn bifocals and bounced his grand-
children on his knee telling them about his summer riding the
rails. But he had to get off the train. And ended up in Money,
Mississippi. And was horribly, brutally, inexcusably, and unac-
ceptably murdered. This is for the Pullman Porters who, when the
sheriff was trying to get the body secretly buried, got Emmett’s
body on the northbound train, got his body home to Chicago,
where his mother said: I want the world to see what they did
to my boy. And this is for all the mothers who cried. And this is
for all the people who said Never Again. And this is about Rosa
Parks whose feet were not so tired, it had been, after all, an ordi-
nary day, until the bus driver gave her the opportunity to make
history. This is about Mrs. Rosa Parks from Tuskegee, Alabama,
who was also the field secretary of the NAACP. This is about the
moment Rosa Parks shouldered her cross, put her worldly goods
aside, was willing to sacrifice her life, so that that young man in
Money, Mississippi, who had been so well protected by the
Pullman Porters, would not have died in vain. When Mrs. Parks
said “NO” a passionate movement was begun. No longer would
there be a reliance on the law; there was a higher law. When Mrs.
Parks brought that light of hers to expose the evil of the system,
the sun came and rested on her shoulders bringing the heat and
the light of truth. Others would follow Mrs. Parks. Four young
men in Greensboro, North Carolina, would also say No. Great
voices would be raised singing the praises of God and exhorting
us “to forgive those who trespass against us.” But it was the

'Rosa Parks' begins with the narrator stating that this poem is for the “Pullman Porters” who organized and brought important newspapers to Black Americans. The narrator then goes on to describe various important events in African-American history. The narrator praises the brave actions of the Pullman Porters throughout the Civil Rights movement and then ends the poem by discussing Rosa Parks. The narrator connects all the actions of the Pullman Porters to that fateful moment in history when Rosa Parks decided she had had enough. This then inspired more people to follow her lead, which jump-started a movement that changed all of history."
1206,1217,1217,"This is the month, and this the happy morn,
Wherein the Son of Heav'n's eternal King,
Of wedded Maid, and Virgin Mother born,
Our great redemption from above did bring;
For so the holy sages once did sing,
That he our deadly forfeit should release,
And with his Father work us a perpetual peace.
That glorious Form, that Light unsufferable,
And that far-beaming blaze of Majesty,
Wherewith he wont at Heav'n's high council-table,
To sit the midst of Trinal Unity,
He laid aside, and here with us to be,
Forsook the courts of everlasting day,
And chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay.
Say Heav'nly Muse, shall not thy sacred vein
Afford a present to the Infant God?
Hast thou no verse, no hymn, or solemn strain,
To welcome him to this his new abode,
Now while the heav'n, by the Sun's team untrod,
Hath took no print of the approaching light,
And all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright?
See how from far upon the eastern road
The star-led wizards haste with odours sweet:
O run, prevent them with thy humble ode,
And lay it lowly at his blessed feet;
Have thou the honour first thy Lord to greet,
And join thy voice unto the angel quire,
From out his secret altar touch'd with hallow'd fire.
It was the winter wild,
While the Heav'n-born child,
All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies;
Nature in awe to him
Had doff'd her gaudy trim,
With her great Master so to sympathize:
It was no season then for her
To wanton with the Sun, her lusty paramour.
Only with speeches fair
She woos the gentle air
To hide her guilty front with innocent snow,
And on her naked shame,
Pollute with sinful blame,
The saintly veil of maiden white to throw,
Confounded, that her Maker's eyes
Should look so near upon her foul deformities.
But he, her fears to cease,
Sent down the meek-ey'd Peace:
She, crown'd with olive green, came softly sliding
Down through the turning sphere,
His ready harbinger,
With turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing;
And waving wide her myrtle wand,
She strikes a universal peace through sea and land.
No war or battle's sound
Was heard the world around;
The idle spear and shield were high uphung;
The hooked chariot stood
Unstain'd with hostile blood;
The trumpet spake not to the armed throng;
And kings sate still with awful eye,
As if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by.
But peaceful was the night
Wherein the Prince of Light
His reign of peace upon the earth began:
The winds with wonder whist,
Smoothly the waters kist,
Whispering new joys to the mild Ocean,
Who now hath quite forgot to rave,
While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave.
The Stars with deep amaze
Stand fix'd in steadfast gaze,
Bending one way their precious influence;
And will not take their flight,
For all the morning light,
Or Lucifer that often warn'd them thence,
But in their glimmering orbs did glow,
Until their Lord himself bespake, and bid them go.
And though the shady gloom
Had given day her room,
The Sun himself withheld his wonted speed,
And hid his head for shame,
As his inferior flame
The new-enlighten'd world no more should need:
He saw a greater Sun appear
Than his bright throne or burning axle-tree could bear.
The shepherds on the lawn,
Or ere the point of dawn,
Sate simply chatting in a rustic row;
Full little thought they than
That the mighty Pan
Was kindly come to live with them below:
Perhaps their loves, or else their sheep,
Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep;
When such music sweet
Their hearts and ears did greet,
As never was by mortal finger strook,
Divinely warbled voice
Answering the stringed noise,
As all their souls in blissful rapture took:
The air such pleasure loth to lose,
With thousand echoes still prolongs each heav'nly close.
Nature, that heard such sound
Beneath the hollow round
Of Cynthia's seat, the Airy region thrilling,
Now was almost won
To think her part was done,
And that her reign had here its last fulfilling:
She knew such harmony alone
Could hold all heav'n and earth in happier union.
At last surrounds their sight
A globe of circular light,
That with long beams the shame-fac'd Night array'd;
The helmed Cherubim
And sworded Seraphim
Are seen in glittering ranks with wings display'd,
Harping in loud and solemn quire,
With unexpressive notes to Heav'n's new-born Heir.
Such music (as 'tis said)
Before was never made,
But when of old the sons of morning sung,
While the Creator great
His constellations set,
And the well-balanc'd world on hinges hung,
And cast the dark foundations deep,
And bid the welt'ring waves their oozy channel keep.
Ring out ye crystal spheres!
Once bless our human ears
(If ye have power to touch our senses so)
And let your silver chime
Move in melodious time,
And let the bass of Heav'n's deep organ blow;
And with your ninefold harmony
Make up full consort to th'angelic symphony.
For if such holy song
Enwrap our fancy long,
Time will run back and fetch the age of gold,
And speckl'd Vanity
Will sicken soon and die,
And leprous Sin will melt from earthly mould;
And Hell itself will pass away,
And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering Day.
Yea, Truth and Justice then
Will down return to men,
Orb'd in a rainbow; and, like glories wearing,
Mercy will sit between,
Thron'd in celestial sheen,
With radiant feet the tissu'd clouds down steering;
And Heav'n, as at some festival,
Will open wide the gates of her high palace hall.
But wisest Fate says no:
This must not yet be so;
The Babe lies yet in smiling infancy,
That on the bitter cross
Must redeem our loss,
So both himself and us to glorify:
Yet first to those ychain'd in sleep,
The wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep,
With such a horrid clang
As on Mount Sinai rang
While the red fire and smould'ring clouds outbrake:
The aged Earth, aghast
With terror of that blast,
Shall from the surface to the centre shake,
When at the world's last session,
The dreadful Judge in middle air shall spread his throne.
And then at last our bliss
Full and perfect is,
But now begins; for from this happy day
Th'old Dragon under ground,
In straiter limits bound,
Not half so far casts his usurped sway,
And, wrath to see his kingdom fail,
Swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail.
The Oracles are dumb;
No voice or hideous hum
Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving.
Apollo from his shrine
Can no more divine,
With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving.
No nightly trance or breathed spell
Inspires the pale-ey'd priest from the prophetic cell.
The lonely mountains o'er,
And the resounding shore,
A voice of weeping heard and loud lament;
From haunted spring, and dale
Edg'd with poplar pale,
The parting Genius is with sighing sent;
With flow'r-inwoven tresses torn
The Nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.
In consecrated earth,
And on the holy hearth,
The Lars and Lemures moan with midnight plaint;
In urns and altars round,
A drear and dying sound
Affrights the flamens at their service quaint;
And the chill marble seems to sweat,
While each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat.
Peor and Ba{:a}lim
Forsake their temples dim,
With that twice-batter'd god of Palestine;
And mooned Ashtaroth,
Heav'n's queen and mother both,
Now sits not girt with tapers' holy shine;
The Libyc Hammon shrinks his horn;
In vain the Tyrian maids their wounded Thammuz mourn.
And sullen Moloch, fled,
Hath left in shadows dread
His burning idol all of blackest hue:
In vain with cymbals' ring
They call the grisly king,
In dismal dance about the furnace blue.
The brutish gods of Nile as fast,
Isis and Orus, and the dog Anubis, haste.
Nor is Osiris seen
In Memphian grove or green,
Trampling the unshower'd grass with lowings loud;
Nor can he be at rest
Within his sacred chest,
Naught but profoundest Hell can be his shroud:
In vain with timbrel'd anthems dark
The sable-stoled sorcerers bear his worshipp'd ark.
He feels from Juda's land
The dreaded Infant's hand,
The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn;
Nor all the gods beside
Longer dare abide,
Not Typhon huge ending in snaky twine:
Our Babe, to show his Godhead true,
Can in his swaddling bands control the damned crew.
So when the Sun in bed,
Curtain'd with cloudy red,
Pillows his chin upon an orient wave,
The flocking shadows pale
Troop to th'infernal jail,
Each fetter'd ghost slips to his several grave,
And the yellow-skirted fays
Fly after the night-steeds, leaving their moon-lov'd maze.
But see, the Virgin blest
Hath laid her Babe to rest:
Time is our tedious song should here have ending.
Heav'n's youngest-teemed star,
Hath fix'd her polish'd car,
Her sleeping Lord with handmaid lamp attending;
And all about the courtly stable,
Bright-harness'd Angels sit in order serviceable.",The sun's rays sway in the midst of the sh,"'On the Morning of Christ's Nativity' by John Milton is a long, celebratory poem that speaks on the birth of Christ and the wider worldly reaction. The poem takes the reader through a series of natural images at the beginning of the poem. The poet speaks on what the sun, stars, moon, and nature, in general, were doing. Their reactions are similar and express for the reader the power of the child's birth. The poem then moves into a prediction of what the future is going to be like. Peace is going to cover all the lands and no one is going to war. But, that can't happen yet. First Christ has to die. Darkness comes over the poem briefly but is quickly lifted to make way for a series of pagan images. These old gods are described as leaving their abodes and traveling hastily to Hell. That is where they must stay for the rest time. In the last stanza, the poet returns to the image of the manger."
1207,1218,1218,"A story, a story!
(Let it go. Let it come.)
I was stamped out like a Plymouth fender
into this world.
First came the crib
with its glacial bars.
Then dolls
and the devotion to their plactic mouths.
Then there was school,
the little straight rows of chairs,
blotting my name over and over,
but undersea all the time,
a stranger whose elbows wouldn’t work.
Then there was life
with its cruel houses
and people who seldom touched-
though touch is all-
but I grew,
like a pig in a trenchcoat I grew,
and then there were many strange apparitions,
the nagging rain, the sun turning into poison
and all of that, saws working through my heart,
but I grew, I grew,
and God was there like an island I had not rowed to,
still ignorant of Him, my arms, and my legs worked,
and I grew, I grew,
I wore rubies and bought tomatoes
and now, in my middle age,
about nineteen in the head I’d say,
I am rowing, I am rowing
though the oarlocks stick and are rusty
and the sea blinks and rolls
like a worried eyebal,
but I am rowing, I am rowing,
though the wind pushes me back
and I know that that island will not be perfect,
it will have the flaws of life,
the absurdities of the dinner table,
but there will be a door
and I will open it
and I will get rid of the rat insdie me,
the gnawing pestilential rat.
God will take it with his two hands
and embrace it.


As the African says:
This is my tale which I have told,
if it be sweet, if it be not sweet,
take somewhere else and let some return to me.
This story ends with me still rowing.",I was stamped out like a Plymouth fender into this world. First came the crib,"'Rowing' by Anne Sexton is an incredibly powerful poem that addresses the poet's depression and her search for God and happiness. The poem follows the poet throughout her youth, adulthood, and into her middle age. Throughout, she acknowledges the negatives in her life but also highlights how she continued to row, hoping to reach some kind of happiness, and hopefully God, who could take her depression and sorrow in his hands and remove it from her heart."
1208,1219,1219,"Since you ask, most days I cannot remember.
I walk in my clothing, unmarked by that voyage.
Then the almost unnameable lust returns.

Even then I have nothing against life.
I know well the grass blades you mention,
the furniture you have placed under the sun.

But suicides have a special language.
Like carpenters they want to know which tools.
They never ask why build.

Twice I have so simply declared myself,
have possessed the enemy, eaten the enemy,
have taken on his craft, his magic.

In this way, heavy and thoughtful,
warmer than oil or water,
I have rested, drooling at the mouth-hole.

I did not think of my body at needle point.
Even the cornea and the leftover urine were gone.
Suicides have already betrayed the body.

Still-born, they don't always die,
but dazzled, they can't forget a drug so sweet
that even children would look on and smile.

To thrust all that life under your tongue!--
that, all by itself, becomes a passion.
Death's a sad Bone; bruised, you'd say,

and yet she waits for me, year after year,
to so delicately undo an old wound,
to empty my breath from its bad prison.

Balanced there, suicides sometimes meet,
raging at the fruit, a pumped-up moon,
leaving the bread they mistook for a kiss,

leaving the page of the book carelessly open,
something unsaid, the phone off the hook
and the love, whatever it was, an infection.",Suicides have a special language. Like carpenters they want to know which tools,"'Wanting to Die' by Anne Sexton is a powerful poem about the poet's desire to take her own life. The title explains much of what the poem is about—wanting to die. The poet is direct in the address of her feelings on death. She explains that death is not something she fears but something she lusts for. It's a pleasant thought to consider blotting out her life. As the poem progresses, Sexton's imagery gets more complex and scattered. Eventually, she lands on an image of life as a negative and death as an infection that takes one away from it."
1209,1220,1220,"Cold in the earth—and the deep snow piled above thee,
Far, far removed, cold in the dreary grave!
Have I forgot, my only Love, to love thee,
Severed at last by Time's all-severing wave?

Now, when alone, do my thoughts no longer hover
Over the mountains, on that northern shore,
Resting their wings where heath and fern-leaves cover
Thy noble heart forever, ever more?

Cold in the earth—and fifteen wild Decembers,
From those brown hills, have melted into spring:
Faithful, indeed, is the spirit that remembers
After such years of change and suffering!

Sweet Love of youth, forgive, if I forget thee,
While the world's tide is bearing me along;
Other desires and other hopes beset me,
Hopes which obscure, but cannot do thee wrong!

No later light has lightened up my heaven,
No second morn has ever shone for me;
All my life's bliss from thy dear life was given,
All my life's bliss is in the grave with thee.

But, when the days of golden dreams had perished,
And even Despair was powerless to destroy,
Then did I learn how existence could be cherished,
Strengthened, and fed without the aid of joy.

Then did I check the tears of useless passion—
Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine;
Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten
Down to that tomb already more than mine.

And, even yet, I dare not let it languish,
Dare not indulge in memory's rapturous pain;
Once drinking deep of that divinest anguish,
How could I seek the empty world again?","Cold in the earth—and the deep snow piled above thee, Far, far remove","'Remembrance' by Emily Brontë is a mournful and depressing poem that depicts a speaker's emotional state fifteen years after losing her lover. The first stanza of the poem is the darkest in which describes her guilty feelings over her fading memory. She worries because her heart does not mourn as strongly or as powerfully for the lover that she lost fifteen years ago. She directs her words directly to this person, trying to explain to him what's been going on in her life and why her feelings have shifted. She knows that change is inevitable. The speaker is being carried along by the waves of time and her desires and needs are shifting. The poem concludes with a speaker explaining how she eventually had to train her soul to stop morning so heavily for her dead lover. If she did not, she would never be able to find peace in her life, much less joy. Now that things have changed she's able to experience life without feeling as though she should hasten towards her own grave."
1210,1221,1221,"Though my mother was already two years dead
Dad kept her slippers warming by the gas,
put hot water bottles her side of the bed

He'd put you off an hour to give him time
to clear away her things and look alone

He couldn't risk my blight of disbelief

scrape in the rusted lock and end his grief.
He knew she'd just popped out to get the tea.

You haven't both gone shopping; just the same,
in my new black leather phone book there's your name
and the disconnected number I still call."," I believe life ends with death, and that is all.</s","‘Long Distance II’ by Tony Harrison is a four-stanza poem that deals with the irrational manifestations that grief can take. In this work, Harrison relays the nonsensical approaches of a father and his child as they grieve the passing of at least one person, and in both scenarios, their mourning surfaces through actions that are connected to the deceased in ways that simply do not make sense. Both the father and the child realize that these methods of coping could be seen as abnormal, yet they continue with those same patterns of behaviors to manage their heartbreaks.

All in all, this is a work that represents the idiosyncrasies of grief and showcases them in such a relatable manner that the reader can arrive at what could be a shocking conclusion: There is nothing abnormal about treating grief in a nonsensible, or abnormal, way. Rather, grief is a reaction to something barely understandable, and dealing with it in ways that are not logical is somehow fitting and common."

The weather here’s so good, he took the chance
To do a bit of weeding.”
So I saw him

Stalk from the other, gently pulling up
Everything not tapered, frail and leafless,
Pleased to feel each little weed-root break,
But rueful also . . . Then found myself listening to
The amplified grave ticking of hall clocks
Where the phone lay unattended in a calm
Of mirror glass and sunstruck pendulums . . . And found myself then thinking: if it were nowadays,
This is how Death would summon Everyman.
Next thing he spoke and I nearly said I loved him.",Then I saw him down on his hands and knees beside the leek rig,"'A Call' by Seamus Heaney depicts the relationship between the poet and his father while speaking on themes of time, death and love. The poem begins with the speaker on the phone with his mother. She is setting the phone down in order to get the poet's father. The next stanza is made up of Heaney's thoughts during the interval in which the phone is left unattended. He is able to visualize his father in his garden, weeding. When Heaney's father gets on the phone the poet immediately struck with the urge to tell him that he loves him. But, only “nearly”. He doesn't do it, something he came to regret."

Pitched past pitch of grief' by Gerard Manley Hopkins describes the nature of a speaker's depression and its highs and lows. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is in a place that is so bad it would be almost impossible to tell if it got worse. When more pangs come, he'll feel them though as they've learned to from the “forepangs,” or those which came before. He goes on to appeal to God, Jesus, and Mary for help. He feels as if they have abandoned him. In the next set of lines the speaker goes on to discuss his own sorrow as a herd of various pains. They all stem from the common “world-pain.” That is, the greater unhappiness that is inherent to the human condition. Luckily, or unluckily, the speaker's pain comes and goes, at least to an extent. The “lull” that he speaks of is later defined as death itself, or more often, as sleep at the end of the day. These are the only things he has to look forward to."

And the rounded darkness of your breast,

And shadows where your wayward eyelids rest.

Lurks in the lithe abandon of your walk
And something of the shackled slave
Sobs in the rhythm of your talk.

In the first lines of this poem, the speaker gives a young Black girl four reasons why she is loved. She tells her that she loves her for her dark skin, rounded breast, her “breaking sadness,” and the way her “wayward eyelids rest.” As the poem progresses, the poet emphasizes the purely beautiful and hopeful qualities of this young girl's life and the darker, oppressive past that she has to throw off. The speaker seeks to inspire this young girl and all those she symbolizes to forget that “you once were slave” and “keep all you have a queenliness.”"

O look at all the fire","'The Starlight Night' by Gerard Manley Hopkins describes the importance of looking at the stars and appreciating God's creation in one's everyday life. The poem begins with the speaker imploring his listener to look up at the sky and observe the stars closely. He doesn't have scientific knowledge of space. Instead, he uses metaphors to express his appreciation for the beauty of the stars. The first comparison is “fire-folk sitting in the air.” The stars seem to have an agency all their own. He continues on with a number of other metaphors, comparing the stars to “circle-citadels” and “diamond delves.” No matter what he thinks of, it is magical and fantastical in nature. It is through these striking comparisons that Hopkins hopes to encourage a reader outside and into a proper state of mind. The second set of lines is more complex. Here, the speaker expresses his disappointment that God's creation is taken for granted. People do not seem to have the energy to observe the beautiful world around them. The poem ends with the speaker giving the stars greater meaning by stating that they are the souls of the dead."

That was that Sunday afternoon in May
When a hot sun pushed through the clouds
And you were born!

I was driving the two hundred miles from west to east,
The sky blue-and-white china in the fields
In impromptu picnics of tartan rugs;

When neither words nor I
Could have known that you had been named already
And that your name was Rosie –

Rosie Joyce! May you some day in May
Fifty-six years from today be as lucky
As I was when you were born that Sunday:

To drive such side-roads, such main roads, such ramps, such
roundabouts,
To cross such bridges, to by-pass such villages, such towns
As I did on your Incarnation Day.

By-passing Swinford – Croagh Patrick in my rear-view mirror –
My cell phone rang and, stopping on the hard edge of P. Flynn’s highway,
I heard Mark your father say:

“A baby girl was born at 3.33 p.m.
Weighing 7 and a I/2 Ibs in Holles Street.
Tough work, all well.”

That Sunday in May before daybreak
Night had pushed up through the slopes of Achill
Yellow forefingers of Arum Lily – the first of the year;

Down at the Sound the first rhododendrons
Purpling the golden camps of whins;
The first hawthorns powdering white the mainland;

The first yellow irises flagging roadside streams;
Quills of bog-cotton skimming the bogs;
Burrishoole cemetery shin-deep in forget-me-nots;

The first sea pinks speckling the seashore;
Cliffs of London Pride, groves of bluebell,
First fuchsia, Queen Anne’s Lace, primrose.

I drove the Old Turlough Road, past Walter Durcan’s Farm,
Umbrella’d in the joined handwriting of its ash trees;
I drove Tulsk, Kilmainham, the Grand Canal.

Never before had I felt so fortunate.
To be driving back into Dublin city;
Each canal bridge an old pewter brooch.

I rode the waters and the roads of Ireland,
Rosie, to be with you, seashell at my ear!
How I laughed when I cradled you in my hand.

Only at Tarmonbarry did I slow down,
As in my father’s Ford Anglia half a century ago
He slowed down also, as across the River Shannon

We crashed, rattled and bounced on a Bailey bridge;
Daddy relishing his role as Moses,
Enunciating the name of the Great Divide

Between the East and the West!
We are the people of the West,
Our fate to go East.

No such thing, Rosie, as a Uniform Ireland
And please God there never will be;
There is only the River Shannon and all her sister rivers

And all her brother mountains and their family prospects.
There are higher powers than politics
And these we call wildflowers or, geologically, people.

Rossie Joyce – that Sunday in May
Not alone did you make my day, my week, my year
To the prescription of Jonathan Philbin Bowman –

Daymaker!
Daymaker!
Daymaker!

Popping out of my daughter, your mother –
Changing the expressions on the faces all around you –
All of them looking like blue hills in a heat haze –

But you saved my life. For three years
I had been subsisting in the slums of despair,
Unable to distinguish one day from the next.

In Charlestown on Main Street
I meet John Normanly, organic farmer from Curry.

He is driving home to his wife Caroline
From a Mountbellew meeting of the Western Development

The poem begins with the speaker expressing his joy over the birth of a child. At first, it's unclear who this child is to him, but towards the end of the second section, he states that his daughter gave birth to her, making him her grandfather. Durcan's speaker expresses his elation over the arrival of this new life and what it means for the world. He feels as though everything around him foretold her arrival. Later, he says, he understood her name to have always been “Rosie”. It never could've been anything else. In the second section of the poem he uses the landscape of Ireland, the places he saw the day before and that morning to embody the joy he feels. On the morning of that May Sunday, the “first” plants were blooming. They stood as symbols of the new life that entered into the world that afternoon. The poem concludes with a wider consideration of Ireland and the diversity of opinion."

The poem begins with epic pronouncements from the narrator, including the claim that they mastered the moon and controlled the passage of time. It quickly becomes apparent that the narrator is moving at great speed and that it is the distorted view of their surroundings through the windows and windscreen that are creating these sensations of control. The poem continues to depict the narrator's journey and establishes a dichotomy between the darkness they are leaving behind and the light before them. This emphasizes the fact that, like all journeys, this drive is a temporal voyage as well as a geographical one. The poem ends by reaffirming the narrator's final goal, the sun, and reminds the reader that the journey is never complete, as the narrator is chasing something that is perpetually beyond their reach."

'The Other' by Ted Hughes describes how the poet's better half had a major impact on the poet's life. In the beginning, the poet focuses on the word “smile”, his only possession. He exchanged it with his wife for her poetic talent and ambitious nature. Still, there was a “vacuum” in himself. Moreover, the poet says, he had to change her “hubris”. That's why with “A little touch of hatred”, he “steadied the nerves” of his wife. Alongside this, the poet took all the “happiness” from his wife. At last, “she had nothing”. Likewise, when she died, she took away all the “smiles” the poet had."

Pamphilia to Amphilanthus describes the feelings and expressions of a girl after her love has been unfaithful to her. Particularly, in Sonnet 11, the lyrical voice is distressed and afflicted by the loss of her love; she begs for her heartache to stop, threatening to put an end to it herself.The poem, as the title suggests, is a sonnet, meaning that it has three quatrains (stanzas with four lines) and a final rhyming couplet. The rhyme scheme is ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. This type of poem is also known as a Shakespearean sonnet. Sonnet 11 has love as the main theme, but it depicts the dark side of the emotion. Moreover, the tone is aggressive and bitter in most parts of the poem, even though the lyrical voice also expresses misery and deep agony."

Aldington separates his poem into six stanzas of varying length, each containing between three and five lines. The poem does not rhyme or have a set meter, probably because it does not need to utilize such poetic devices—the imagery conveys all that is necessary. Aldington uses vivid scenes of nature to compare the way he feels for his lover. His imagery includes a gondola floating through the waters of Venice to the red deer on the mountainside and a flower battling back to life after harsh winds."
1221,1232,1232,"When the first dark had fallen around them
And the leaves were weary of praise,
In the clear silence Beauty found them
And shewed them all her ways.
In the high noon of the heavenly garden
Where the angels sunned with the birds,
Beauty, before their hearts could harden,
Had taught them heavenly words.
When they fled in the burning weather
And nothing dawned but a dream,
Beauty fasted their hands together
And cooled them at her stream.
And when day wearied and night grew stronger,
And they slept as the beautiful must,
Then she bided a little longer,
And blossomed from their dust.",Beauty found them and shewed them all her ways. In the high noon of the,"Adam and Eve by Marjorie Pickthall begins by focusing on the first-night fall, after a day of 'praise' it comes and overshadows everything. Yet, in this darkness 'Beauty found them', coming to love and protect the two lovers. The following day 'Beauty' began to teach the pair, giving them 'heavenly words' while angels and birds played in the background. Whenever Adam and Eve found trouble, for example as they 'fled in the burning weather', 'Beauty' provided for them, cooling 'them at her stream'. Beauty and nature can be compounded as the same idea within this poem, the beauty of nature being something comforting to the lovers. Even as the night grows stronger, Beauty is still there to protect them, following in their wake at all times."

They laugh, but the grandmother only does so to cover up her tears. Her sorrow is a constant source of mystery in this piece and is never explained.

Of being independent.

And resolutely keep its laws,
Uncaring consequences.

At the beginning of the poem, Thoreau's persona describes the nature of love. According to him, love is a feeling that is heavenly in itself. He does not know why it is so nor does anyone. Love is not a verbal expression. It is either experienced or felt. In the following lines, he speaks of a man having three qualities: love for truth, eyes to appreciate beauty, and inherent goodness. His friend has all these qualities. As they are similar in nature, they became friends. The friendship between them helps each of them to grow. It ties them together in a bond making two of them “one”. The last two stanzas metaphorically describe the speaker and his friend as two sturdy oaks standing in the meadow's pride. Like the trees, they both are strong. While looking from outside, it may seem their heads barely touch. But, their roots are intertwined."

While the pain was fresh, it was encompassing to the point of complicating day and night on different levels. After months had passed, the vocabulary of the poem suggests the narrator had pushed away the memory that caused the “breaking,” but then turned and asked the “heart” if it “remembered” the painful moment. In response, the “heart” did not even recognize itself enough to offer an appropriate answer.

What this reveals to the reader is that pain linked to good memories must be embraced as pushing away the pain also pushes away those good memories. Without the care and honesty that come with embracing those moments, the very being of a person could be compromised so much that the person becomes unrecognizable in their own eyes."

In the following lines the sun funnels its light into the sea without seeming to know it is emptying. Three characters are introduced to the narrative. A man wading into the sea and two young boys.

The darkness of the twilight makes its way through the speaker's home. She refers to the dark as a woman who is a “silent guest” in her house. The “silent guest” makes her way through the various rooms, spreading her shadow. Eventually, after a lot of language suggesting the dark to be a malign presence, the two come together. Rather than engaging in a fearful meeting, they are clear comrades. Together they are able to offset one another's loneliness and break up the isolated worlds they live in."

Their thick tongues blort, their eyes squeeze grief, a crowd Of huge unheard answers jam and rejoice—

To some it means the difference they could make By loving others, but across most it sweeps

This does not seem to matter to the women who are emotionally overturned by the experience. Some wander off, others standstill, unable to comprehend what happened. They contemplate God, love, and the life they have lived up until this point."

In the four lines of 'First Fig,' the poet creates an extended metaphor with the image of a candle burning at both ends. The candle, which comes to represent everything from sex to literature, works to depict Millay's well-lived life. Despite the fact that it can't burn forever, she wants everyone to admire it's “lovely light”."

Which he beside the rivulet

So with his wife and child he fled,
Nor had he where to rest his head.

His grandchild Wilhelmine is playing near him. Suddenly she sees her brother Peterkin who is coming there with a skull in his hand. He has found the skull beside a rivulet. Kaspar takes the skull from Peterkin and starts to answer their questions about the war of Blenheim. Kaspar's answers reflect a common man's perception of the war of Blenheim. The common people of England at that time didn't know about the cause of the war. They could only tell that the victory of the English side was remarkable.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that in an instant “Joy” was born to him. He was so thrilled by its presence that he climbed onto his roof and shouted to the neighborhood. It was his intention to share with the world his new-found happiness. Unfortunately, no one noticed. Those he thought would come and celebrate with him never showed up. Although disappointed, the speaker was not deterred. He returned to the same spot for the next seven months, declaring the “Joy” he was now in possession of. No matter what he did though, no one cared. Eventually, he became so worn down by the lack of response that he gave up. “Joy” was soon to leave him at this point. It was replaced by “Sorrow.”"

The poem begins with the speaker giving a few examples of how things, animate and inanimate, show their inner selves. The kingfisher catches “fire” as do the “dragonflies.” There is the sound of a rock falling in a well, and that of a hammer hitting the inside of a bell. These are the purposes of these objects and animals. Through their expression of their inner selves, they grow close to God. This is the same for human beings. If one taps into their most essential self, then they too will be inhabited by Christ and seen in a good light by God."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that the light of the moon is casting down on earth. This is occurring while, “she,” the moon, moves slowly through the sky. The moon is taking its time, choosing to look at everything on earth while “she” has the chance. Some of the creatures and objects that are spotted and therefore cast in “silver light” are the “casements” of windows, doves, a dog, and sleeping fish. These creatures and objects are perfectly mundane and ordinary. There is nothing remarkable about them during the day, but at night they are enhanced and made more beautiful. "

But, they add, there are deep griefs than these that people contend with throughout their lives. The speaker asserts that to find some love but miss out on perfect love is far worse than never being loved at all. They also suggest that singing but missing out by a half-tone on the perfect song is worse than never singing."

In the first lines of this poem, the speaker begins by telling the reader that she and her mother are debating selling the black walnut tree on their property. They spend time talking through the pros of this sale. It's an old tree, likely to fall onto the house, and is often overburdened with fruit. The roots have made their way into the basement drains as well. But, there's something that keeps them from making the sale, despite the fact that they could pay off the mortgage with the money. The tree represents their family heritage and the handwork their ancestors did to establish a home there. The speaker has a dream about her “fathers,” who emigrated from Europe to work in Ohio. This helps solidify the fact that if they cut the tree down, they'd have to deal with unshakeable shame. So, it seems the two decide to keep the tree, at least for the time being."

The poem begins with the speaker outlining four different reasons she loves her partner. These are mainly physical reasons; ones that are closely associated with the passion she is looking for in a relationship. She is drawn to this person's lips when they are wet wth wine, their eyes which hold a special light, and the feeling of their skin. In the second stanza, she speaks on a different kind of relationship, one she is not seeking. She has no desire for cold, calm kisses, or a virgin's love. It is passion she is seeking and she tells her listener that they should pursue that for as long as they can."

This is, again, a simple method of expressing the idea that strong unions that are created in such vulnerable moments can be moving enough to remain a part of a person, even after ways “separate.”"

In the first stanza, the speaker outline what's going on around him. The snow and the night sky are coming down fast. He pauses to look at the ground and realizes that there's already a lot of snowfall. It has almost covered everything. The absence of plant life, or anything else but snow, on the ground, makes the speaker consider the rest of the world around him. It is influencing the ground, the trees, and the animals in their lairs. But, it is also influencing the speaker. He is reminded of his own loneliness when he looks out at the empty landscape. Frost concludes the poem with his speaker stating that any image of loneliness in the wider world does not scare him, he has enough “desert places” inside his own mind."

She believes that the thing one loves is the true driving force behind one's life and decisions. In the next stanzas, Sappho uses the example of Helen of Troy and the way that her love changed the direction of the world much more than did Menelaus' weapons. In the final lines, it becomes clear that this piece was dedicated to a woman that the poet loved, and she is hoping to convey to her that their love is of the same providence.

Nor is she a “hawker” or salesperson. She sees these types of people as being dishonest sellers of albatrosses. In the next stanza, she expands on what she is not. She doesn’t take pleasure from nature alongside the ocean shore, nor does she advertise her grief for all to see. The speaker is a very secluded and introverted person. She does not reach out for emotional assistance at any point. The final lines speak about how her emotions move within her like a ship tossing on the ocean. No matter what, they do not leave her."

The poem begins with the speaker facing the black granite wall of the memorial. He sees his own “black face” in the surface and feels as if he is slipping into his past as he reads all of the names written on the wall. He is returned to the time period that he served, or visited, Vietnam during the war, and imagines that his name should be alongside the 52,022 that are engraved on the monument's surface. In the second half of the piece the speaker sees the reflection of a number of mundane interactions in the memorial. He is experiencing the simultaneous existence of peace and war and how it changes those who surround it.

The day that Aphrodite touched her mouth to ours.",Summer brings out the girls in their green dresses Whom the foolish might compare to daff,"Summer 1967' by James K. Baxter is a complex, image-rich poem in which the speaker discusses his past through emotional references. In the first lines of 'Summer 1967,' the speaker talks about the young and the dead. The latter, he states, controls the former. This suggests that old habits, perspectives, and expectations still exist in the young. Even when grandmothers are dead, they still control the limbs of their granddaughters. He goes on, bringing in images of the beach, a bar, and alluding to a relationship that changed him and that he can't block out with any combination of drugs. This was all back in 1967, but whenever the speaker was considering these words, it's clear he still mostly felt the same. This was an important period of time in his life that he puts down on paper with seemingly disparate images and allusions."
1256,1267,1267,"No permanence is ours; we are a wave
That flows to fit whatever form it finds:
Through day or night, cathedral or the cave
We pass forever, craving form that binds.
Mold after mold we fill and never rest,
We find no home where joy or grief runs deep.
We move, we are the everlasting guest.
No field nor plow is ours; we do not reap.
What God would make of us remains unknown:
He plays; we are the clay to his desire.
Plastic and mute, we neither laugh nor groan;
He kneads, but never gives us to the fire.
To stiffen to stone, to persevere!
We long forever for the right to stay.
But all that ever stays with us is fear,
And we shall never rest upon our way.",No permanence is ours; we are a wave that flows to fit whatever form it finds,"'Lament' by Hermann Hesse describes the mental and emotional state of a speaker who is unable to settle on one way of being. The poem begins with the speaker stating that there is no “permanence” in “our” life. He is speaking to a listener who is never defined. This person could be someone specific, or a larger group who feels the same as the speaker does. He cannot find a place that allows him to dig deep into one emotion. Everything he is is in constant flux. His life is like a “wave.” In the next stanzas, he describes how there is “no home” for him “where joy or grief runs deep.” He has yet to experience a true, full emotion, everything is surface level. Above all else, the speaker is looking for the “right to stay.” He wants to be made into a solid, immovable statue. The poem concludes with the speaker saying that there is one thing that has remained in his life, and the life/lives of his listener/listeners: fear. This emotion is always present, no matter what one's individual situation is."

In 'Peeling Onions' by Adrienne Rich, the poetic persona, here the poet herself, is peeling onions. Readers know that while doing this stuff tears come down from our eyes. It is a natural process but in the poem, it becomes a significant metaphor. The poet goes back in her memory while tears fall down. She starts to think of her past when she cried to give her grief an external expression. But everything has changed in her life. She doesn't cry now. There was a moment when she sobbed but the society didn't even care about her grieving. So she has “stuffed” her sadness in her “lungs like smog”. What she visualizes, is the “old tears in the chopping-bowl”, nothing else. You can read the full poem here, or listen to the poem below. It will provide an idea of the mood and tone of the poem. Always remember, sound speaks more than words."
1258,1269,1269,"The city had withdrawn into itself
And left at last the country to the country;
When between whirls of snow not come to lie
And whirls of foliage not yet laid, there drove
A stranger to our yard, who looked the city,
Yet did in country fashion in that there
He sat and waited till he drew us out
A-buttoning coats to ask him who he was.
He proved to be the city come again
To look for something it had left behind
And could not do without and keep its Christmas.
He asked if I would sell my Christmas trees;
My woods—the young fir balsams like a place
Where houses all are churches and have spires.
I hadn’t thought of them as Christmas Trees.
I doubt if I was tempted for a moment
To sell them off their feet to go in cars
And leave the slope behind the house all bare,
Where the sun shines now no warmer than the moon.
I’d hate to have them know it if I was.
Yet more I’d hate to hold my trees except
As others hold theirs or refuse for them,
Beyond the time of profitable growth,
The trial by market everything must come to.
I dallied so much with the thought of selling.
Then whether from mistaken courtesy
And fear of seeming short of speech, or whether
From hope of hearing good of what was mine, I said,
“There aren’t enough to be worth while.”
“I could soon tell how many they would cut,
You let me look them over.”
“You could look.
But don’t expect I’m going to let you have them.”
Pasture they spring in, some in clumps too close
That lop each other of boughs, but not a few
Quite solitary and having equal boughs
All round and round. The latter he nodded “Yes” to,
Or paused to say beneath some lovelier one,
With a buyer’s moderation, “That would do.”
I thought so too, but wasn’t there to say so.
We climbed the pasture on the south, crossed over,
And came down on the north. He said, “A thousand.”
“A thousand Christmas trees!—at what apiece?”
He felt some need of softening that to me:
“A thousand trees would come to thirty dollars.”
Then I was certain I had never meant
To let him have them. Never show surprise!
But thirty dollars seemed so small beside
The extent of pasture I should strip, three cents
(For that was all they figured out apiece),
Three cents so small beside the dollar friends
I should be writing to within the hour
Would pay in cities for good trees like those,
Regular vestry-trees whole Sunday Schools
Could hang enough on to pick off enough.
A thousand Christmas trees I didn’t know I had!
Worth three cents more to give away than sell,
As may be shown by a simple calculation.
Too bad I couldn’t lay one in a letter.
I can’t help wishing I could send you one,
In wishing you herewith a Merry Christmas.","A stranger came to our yard, who looked the city, Yet did in country fashion in that","Christmas Trees' by Robert Frost depicts an interaction between a man with a thousand Christmas trees and a salesman who wants to buy them. The poem is fairly straightforward. It starts out with a description of a man who came to visit the speaker's home. There, he inquired about the Christmas trees in the pasture behind the house. The speaker was surprised about this as he'd never thought about the trees that way. He tells the man he doesn't want to sell them, but he then ends up humoring the city-dweller for a time as he counts the trees and comes up with an offer. He's willing to pay 30 cents per tree and buy all 1,000 trees the speaker has. This is quite a low number the tree owner thinks and decides then and there that he's not going to sell them."

He wandered over the foreland hill and returned in the evening, asking for death,
Not like a beggar, still eyed with the old
Implacable arrogance. I gave him the lead gift in the twilight. What fell was relaxed,
Owl-downy, soft feminine feathers; but what
Soared: the fierce rush: the night-herons by the flooded river cried fear at its rising
Before it was quite unsheathed from reality.","The broken pillar of the wing jags from the clotted shoulder,","Hurt Hawks' by Robinson Jeffers is a beautiful poem that describes the proud strength of an injured hawk forced to live out its last weeks in pain. The poem takes the reader through the fate of an injured hawk that, unable to fly, cannot sustain itself. The speaker describes how he fed the animal for six weeks trying to help it survive but it was not enough of a life for the bird. To him, it seemed to beg to be released from its pain. Eventually, the speaker gives in and shots the bird, releasing its soul."

I clambered to bed; up the globe's impossible sides
I sailed all night—till at last, with my black beard,
My furs and my dogs, I stood at the northern pole.
There in the childish night my companions lay frozen,
The stiff furs knocked at my starveling throat,
And I gave my great sigh: the flakes came huddling,
Were they really my end? In the darkness I turned to my rest.

Where all that I have done is meaningless,
Where I die or live by accident alone—
Where, living or dying, I am still alone;
Here where North, the night, the berg of death
Crowd me out of the ignorant darkness,

I wrung from the darkness—that the darkness flung me—

It is pain.",I clambered to bed; up the globe's impossible sides I saile,"'90 North' by Randall Jarrell is about the realizations that come along with growing up. The poem begins on an imaginative and wistful note, with the speaker recalling the power of his childhood dreams. He would imagine himself as a poler explorer setting foot on the North Pole. Despite the terrible surroundings, he took pride and joy in this accomplishment. Now, as an adult who has reached his real life, metaphorical North Pole, he realizes that success is worthless. His life means nothing, and he's alone in darkness and pain."

to break my heart
as the sun rises,
as the sun strokes them with his old, buttery fingers

boring their deep and mysterious holes
into the curls,
craving the sweet sap,
taking it away

In the first lines of 'Peonies,' the speaker begins by noting how the flowers open in the morning, ready to break the speaker's heart. The sun touches them, and the ants crawl over them. She uses numerous examples of figurative language and imagery in order to depict their surroundings and what they resemble. As the poem progresses, the speaker transitions to address the reader directly. She asks them if they take the time to go outside and enjoy nature at their fingertips. It's important that one does so because before they know it, it's going to be gone. Beauty, just like joy, is fleeting. One has to appreciate it while it's there."

These help readers envision the different lives people live as well as their inner natures. They are more than dishwashers and cooks. They're also storytellers, singers, and dancers. In the last lines of the poem, Hughes focuses on the joyous lives of these men and women and how they're laughing in the hands of fate."

Specifically, this narrator begins to “like” things only because they connect to her companion, though she puts on a façade of moving past the relationship that is shown as false due to her lingering connections to these companion-related items. It seems, overall, that she has not returned to her true being, which can be a warning to the reader in regard to entering into a relationship that is similar. Parts of a person can be lost, and those elements that are handed over might never be retrieved as a consequence of such an immature relationship."

In the first lines of this piece, the speaker begins by noting the sound of the wind and wondering what it thinks about him as he stands in his doorway, holding the door open. The wind is personified in such a way that it's clear the speaker is alone, with time on his hands to consider all the sounds and movements around him. He also describes the leaves, the frothy shore, and the darkening clouds overhead. The speaker alludes to his life through the image of summer fading and being replaced by the storm clouds he's now seeing. As the poem concludes, the speaker wonders if all the forces of nature know he's alone in the world, with only God for company, and are converging on him to take advantage of that fact."

Then, when night arrives, they feel connected to the darkness as they are dark themselves. This is their hope for the future.

The poet's speaker describes going out into the forest to spend the night in the darkness. She depicts the sounds of the various small kingdoms and creatures going about their nightly tasks. She sees sights and hears sounds that she wouldn't normally during the day. This experience is one that elevates her beyond her everyday life and her humanity.

Above the nation's council-hall,
I heard beneath its marble wall

In the foul market-place I stood,
And saw the Christian mother sold,
And childhood with its locks of gold,
Blue-eyed and fair with Saxon blood.
I shut my eyes, I held my breath,
And, smothering down the wrath and shame
That set my Northern blood aflame,
Stood silent, — where to speak was death.

Where wasted one in slow decline

And loving freedom all too well.

Flapped menace in the morning air;

However old, however strong,
But waited God's avenging hour.

On waves of battle-troubled air!
Midst sounds that madden and appall,
The song that Bethlehem's shepherds knew !
The harp of David melting through
The demon-agonies of Saul!

In this poem, Whittier presents an image of the council hall at the beginning of the poem. In a prison, underneath the building, several slaves are chained. The poet hears the sound of their fetters and feels agonized. However, he cannot speak on this matter. If he does so, the slavers are going to send him to prison. However, the poet does not lose hope. He knows that God will do justice in near future. Along with that, he is optimistic about the fact that the wrongs done by men are never spared. God with his firm hands will punish those who are fuelling the custom of slavery."

The winding streams, the Atlantic shore itself.

Swoops, making the air gasp, tearing the crest off one,
Setting it down bleeding on the next.

In Book 1, poem 34, Horace accepts his erstwhile error and declares his belief in the gods. He is especially interested in Jupiter and Fortuna after hearing thunder in a cloudless sky (“My prayers were scant, my offerings few,/While witless wisdom fool'd my mind;/But now I trim my sails anew,/And trace the course I left behind”). Heaney takes this particular mythical episode to write Anything Can Happen. However, the poem reflects not only on the present political possibilities that anything could happen but also on the potential found in memory, elegy, and art."
1270,1281,1281,"One sun rose on us today, kindled over our shores,
peeking over the Smokies, greeting the faces
of the Great Lakes, spreading a simple truth
across the Great Plains, then charging across the Rockies.
One light, waking up rooftops, under each one, a story
told by our silent gestures moving behind windows.

My face, your face, millions of faces in morning’s mirrors,
each one yawning to life, crescendoing into our day:
pencil-yellow school buses, the rhythm of traffic lights,
fruit stands: apples, limes, and oranges arrayed like rainbows
begging our praise. Silver trucks heavy with oil or paper—
bricks or milk, teeming over highways alongside us,
on our way to clean tables, read ledgers, or save lives—
to teach geometry, or ring-up groceries as my mother did
for twenty years, so I could write this poem.

All of us as vital as the one light we move through,
the same light on blackboards with lessons for the day:
equations to solve, history to question, or atoms imagined,
the “I have a dream” we keep dreaming,
or the impossible vocabulary of sorrow that won’t explain
the empty desks of twenty children marked absent
today, and forever. Many prayers, but one light
breathing color into stained glass windows,
life into the faces of bronze statues, warmth
onto the steps of our museums and park benches
as mothers watch children slide into the day.

One ground. Our ground, rooting us to every stalk
of corn, every head of wheat sown by sweat
and hands, hands gleaning coal or planting windmills
in deserts and hilltops that keep us warm, hands
digging trenches, routing pipes and cables, hands
as worn as my father’s cutting sugarcane
so my brother and I could have books and shoes.

The dust of farms and deserts, cities and plains
mingled by one wind—our breath. Breathe. Hear it
through the day’s gorgeous din of honking cabs,
buses launching down avenues, the symphony
of footsteps, guitars, and screeching subways,
the unexpected song bird on your clothes line.

Hear: squeaky playground swings, trains whistling,
or whispers across café tables, Hear: the doors we open
for each other all day, saying: hello / shalom,
buon giorno / howdy / namaste / or buenos días
in the language my mother taught me—in every language
spoken into one wind carrying our lives
without prejudice, as these words break from my lips.

One sky: since the Appalachians and Sierras claimed
their majesty, and the Mississippi and Colorado worked
their way to the sea. Thank the work of our hands:
weaving steel into bridges, finishing one more report
for the boss on time, stitching another wound
or uniform, the first brush stroke on a portrait,
or the last floor on the Freedom Tower
jutting into a sky that yields to our resilience.

One sky, toward which we sometimes lift our eyes
tired from work: some days guessing at the weather
of our lives, some days giving thanks for a love
that loves you back, sometimes praising a mother
who knew how to give, or forgiving a father
who couldn’t give what you wanted.

We head home: through the gloss of rain or weight
of snow, or the plum blush of dusk, but always—home,
always under one sky, our sky. And always one moon
like a silent drum tapping on every rooftop
and every window, of one country—all of us—

waiting for us to name it—together","One sun rose on us today, kindled over our shores, peeking over the Smok","'One Today,' a poem by Richard Blanco, depicts the serene beauty of America and the oneness of the American spirit. This poem captures the happenings inside the nation on a single day. In the morning when the sun rises, it marks a new beginning. Millions of faceless Americans are all equal under the shining sun. The light coming from the sun and the open ground are meant for the citizens of a country. People breathe the same air under one sky. These elements of nature are not prejudiced. They treat everyone equally without any prejudice. Like the sky is the same for everyone, each human inhabiting under it is not different. A nation is nothing but an abstract idea if the people living in the country are deprived of equal opportunity. For this reason, Blanco emphasizes the word, “our” throughout the poem."

A Litany for Survival begins with the speaker describing how there is a segment of the population who lives at the shoreline and continually suffers through “crucial” choices. These people do not have the luxury of spare time as their choices are eminently important to their own lives. The men and women must focus on maintaining the dreams of their children. In the following stanza, the speaker describes the various elements of their lives and how they are controlled by fear. They have learned to fear every side of a situation, the good and the bad. A Litany for Survival concludes with the speaker stating that this group must find a way to shake off their fear of speaking and say what needs to be said. Otherwise, nothing will ever change."
1272,1283,1283,"Belinda lived in a little white house,
With a little black kitten and a little gray mouse,
And a little yellow dog and a little red wagon,
And a realio, trulio, little pet dragon.
Now the name of the little black kitten was Ink,
And the little gray mouse, she called her Blink,
And the little yellow dog was sharp as Mustard,
But the dragon was a coward, and she called him Custard.

Custard the dragon had big sharp teeth,
And spikes on top of him and scales underneath,
Mouth like a fireplace, chimney for a nose,
And realio, trulio, daggers on his toes.

Belinda was as brave as a barrel full of bears,
And Ink and Blink chased lions down the stairs,
Mustard was as brave as a tiger in a rage,
But Custard cried for a nice safe cage.

Belinda tickled him, she tickled him unmerciful,
Ink, Blink and Mustard, they rudely called him Percival,
They all sat laughing in the little red wagon
At the realio, trulio, cowardly dragon.

Belinda giggled till she shook the house,
And Blink said Week!, which is giggling for a mouse,
Ink and Mustard rudely asked his age,
When Custard cried for a nice safe cage.

Suddenly, suddenly they heard a nasty sound,
And Mustard growled, and they all looked around.
Meowch! cried Ink, and Ooh! cried Belinda,
For there was a pirate, climbing in the winda.

Pistol in his left hand, pistol in his right,
And he held in his teeth a cutlass bright,
His beard was black, one leg was wood;
It was clear that the pirate meant no good.

Belinda paled, and she cried, Help! Help!
But Mustard fled with a terrified yelp,
Ink trickled down to the bottom of the household,
And little mouse Blink was strategically mouseholed.

But up jumped Custard, snorting like an engine,
Clashed his tail like irons in a dungeon,
With a clatter and a clank and a jangling squirm
He went at the pirate like a robin at a worm.

The pirate gaped at Belinda’s dragon,
And gulped some grog from his pocket flagon,
He fired two bullets but they didn’t hit,
And Custard gobbled him, every bit.

Belinda embraced him, Mustard licked him,
No one mourned for his pirate victim
Ink and Blink in glee did gyrate
Around the dragon that ate the pyrate.

Belinda still lives in her little white house,
With her little black kitten and her little gray mouse,
And her little yellow dog and her little red wagon,
And her realio, trulio, little pet dragon.

And Ink and Blink chase lions down the stairs,

'The Tale of Custard the Dragon' by Ogden Nash narrates a humorous story of Belinda and her pets in the ballade form. She lives in a little white house with her pets namely Ink, a little black kitten; a grey mouse, Blink; a yellow dog, Mustard; and a cowardly dragon, Custard. She also has a red wagon to play with her pets. Each of the characters appears as courageous and brave except for the dragon who nags for only “a nice safe cage” throughout the poem. But, Belinda loves the dragon the most and it makes others jealous of him. One day an evil pirate stealthily enters Belinda's house. Eventually, all of her pets run away for their safety apart from the cowardly dragon. He gobbles the pirate saving everyone. Thus, the story ends happily. "

And stared aghast to watch him eat;

He describes the merits of his poetry in a different way. The poems aren't meant to make everyone happy all the time. In fact, it's very much the opposite. They are there to make one aware of the tragedies of life and perhaps help one cope if those tragedies should enter into their own life."

'Dawn at Puri' by Jayanta Mahapatra presents a picturesque description of the seashore and the pilgrims visiting each day to visit the famous temple of Jagannath. At the beach, there are numerous crows gathering here and there. In this noisy ambiance, the poet observes a skull resembling poor and hungry millions of our country. Thereafter the poet shifts his vision and looks at the temple where “white-clad widowed Women” are waiting to enter the “Great Temple”. The poet sees a deep religious yearning in their eyes. In the next section of 'Dawn at Puri', Mahapatra shifts again to the seashore and now he rather sees empty shells lying there instead of crows. It is actually an instance of symbolism that will be discussed later in the analysis section. In the landscape suddenly a heap of smoke seeks the attention of the poet. It is actually coming out of a cremation pyre. The poem ends with the wish of the poet's aging mother. She wants to be cremated at her native place like the mentioned pyre on the seashore."

It will not matter if the world is not perfect, or if there have been lies and mistakes in the past. Within the second stanza, the speaker describes the power that love has in the world. It allows lovers to move beyond the mundane and disregard the basic elements of human life which bother others.

In this haiku poem, there are only three images. One is a static image of an old pond. The second one is a dynamic image of a frog jumping into the pond. Lastly, there is an auditory image that presents the sound that is generated from a frog jumping into the pond-water. While reading the haiku, one has to be imaginative to get to the core of the poem. To begin with, the pond in the poem is an old water body. It seems people have either abandoned the pond or it is there for a long time. Thereafter, the frog that jumps into the pond presents two things, the season and the reason for its jumping. Lastly, the water's sound creates a resonance in a reader's mind. This sound has some deeper meaning that is discussed in the latter part of the analysis."

she’d have one, always, up her sleeve.

Tucked in the wrists of every cardi,
a mum’s embarrassment of lace
embroidered with a V for Viv,
spittled and scrubbed against my face.
And sometimes more than one fell out
as is she had a farm up there
where dried-up hankies fell in love
and mated, raising little squares.
She bought her own; I never did.
Hankies were presents from distant aunts
in boxed sets, with transparent covers
and script initials spelling ponce,
the naffest Christmas gift you’d get –
my brothers too, more often than not,
got male ones: serious, and grey,
and larger, like they had more snot.

It was hankie that closed department stores,
with headscarves, girdles, knitting wool
and trouser presses; homely props
you’d never find today in malls.
Hankies, which demanded irons,
and boiling to be purified
shuttered the doors of family stores
when those who used to buy them died.

of haddock smoked the colour of yolks
and parcelled rows of local crab

and smudge the rouge from little dears.

The speaker expresses exasperation with this traditional “material” in the first part of the poem but as it progresses she turns nostalgic.

The speaker compares this to elegant dancing. He says that he is a clodhopper, someone who is clumsy and cannot dance. Thus, he stumbles in the middle of speaking once a conversation begins. He silently leaves and hunches back to the barn. It is the only place where he feels at home yet completely alone.

Though rational answers are never given to the child by her mother, details of Lulu’s disappearance still come to the surface, and they reveal that Lulu has apparently run away from home after a verbal (perhaps physical) altercation to find somewhere less limiting to her mindset. More than the aspects of Lulu’s departure, the mother’s insistence to lie and deflect the young speaker’s concerns reveal the very genuine possibility that she’s making the same mistakes with a younger child as she did with Lulu, ones that could lead to similar trouble in the future. These details are hard to say for certain since Causley tends to hold relevant ideas in vague territory that keep the reader questioning, much like the young speaker. Like that speaker, though, readers want to have their questions validated with answers, and that freedom to wonder is a theme of What Has Happened to Lulu? — and possibly the reason for Lulu’s leaving."

Yet, the poet argues that love is blinding, waking up after she is alone again, and realizing how much she has changed. After their whole relationship together, all they have left is memories.

They drank on the cajoling beauty of nature including a pink cloud at dusk, the moon, its glowing smile, and friendship. The question of God's existence was not important for the speaker or his friend. The momentary beauty was all that mattered to them most. Later, as a grown-up man, the speaker realizes that there is something stirring in the details that keep coming back into his mind. There God hints at his existence. So, now he can explore the role of God alongside other things."

Yesterday I saw the moon
Sailing high, but faint and white,
As a school-boy's paper kite. 

In broad daylight, yesterday,
I read a Poet's mystic lay;
And it seemed to me at most
As a phantom, or a ghost. 

But at length the feverish day
Like a passion died away,
And the night, serene and still,
Fell on village, vale, and hill. 

Then the moon, in all her pride,
Like a spirit glorified,
Filled and overflowed the night
With revelations of her light. 

And the Poet's song again
Passed like music through my brain;
Night interpreted to me
All its grace and mystery.","The moon, in all her pride, Like a spirit glorified, Filled and over","Daylight and Moonlight' by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow is a beautiful poem that depicts the “feverish day” and the “serene” night. In eh first two stanzas of the poem, the poet spends time talking about the day. He depicts the moon, faint and kite-like in the sky at noon and his time spent reading poetry in the light “yesterday.” In the third stanza, the poem starts to transition into nighttime. There, the moon rises once more and fills the sky with light the poet admires. It's proud and glorious. The night is also far more serene than the day. It brings with it a different kind of peace that's also represented by the poet's song."

Although the photo is ‘some seventy’ years old, she still feels connected to the moment captured. The poem delicately balances life and death. While the man and the wheat he is chopping are now dead, they somehow live on through the photograph. This idea of the eternal nature of a moment is the central focus of the poem, allowing Holden to play with ideas of time.The poem is split into three five-line stanzas, without a regular rhyme scheme. The majority of the lines of the poem are enjambed, allowing the poem to still retain a sense of rhythm. The poem weaves across time periods, with the majority of the poem taking place in the past. Two main themes are explored by Holden in the poem. The first is the representation of life and death, and an odd combination of the two. The second is the focus on the beauty of nature."

The song, sung by Merry and Pippin, speaks of the dangers that all the hobbits, and eventually the Fellowship, are going to face as they head out on their quest. They all have to leave the comforts of their homes behind, prepare to sleep outside, and live a very different kind of life for the foreseeable future."

In the poem, Ashbery uses contradictions in language to get the reader to think about meaning. He alludes to how readers of a poem will assign different meaning to the same words. This fits with the postmodern idea of shifting meaning in language, that a meaning of a word is not static but changes in relation to other words. The work of French philosopher and literary theorist, Jacques Derrida, outlines this in detail. Ashbery, however, only touches on it and positions the reader to think about it. For him, the elusiveness of meaning calls for an interaction between reader and poem. He wants the reader to be a creative part of the poem, as we shall see."

The poet begins by describing the suddenness of the crash and how, in an instant, they became part of the car, and the car became part of the deer. The moments ran together quickly and with little pause. Before the speaker even has time to think, they're dying. There's no time at all for last words or even an “I am sorry” directed towards God."

The poem begins with the speaker describing a number of scenes of peace. There are birds circling, singing out their “shimmering sound[s],” as well as frogs croaking in pools of water at night. The wind, trees, and creatures of the world are in alignment and are content with one another. The second half of the poem describes how nature and “Spring” would not notice if all of humankind was at war. It would not impact them in the slightest. Additionally, they would not notice if every person on the planet disappeared, so little do humans fit into their world."

It expresses the plight of the poet persona, stemming from his mental illness. Contrary to what the title may imply, 'To God' is not a spiritual poem per se. Though religion is a major influence, courtesy of our poet being a spiritual person. While making use of the literary device, apostrophe, Ivor—as the persona in the poem—asks God why he's suffering within “four walls” (in other words, his asylum). As the poem progresses, he laments about his time at the mental hospital. Ivor calls it “a sensual Hell”. “A dreadful hell”, however, is how he refers to his mental illness. It slowly eats away at him as we read on until he's asking for death. With the last few lines, Ivor summarises his maltreatment at the asylum. Or perhaps, his time fighting in World War I. By speaking little of the cruelty he'd witnessed at either place/time, Ivor Gurney ends his poem on an impassioned note."

He asserts that all their praises were anticipating the subject as he is today, and because they were merely prophesying, they didn't have the skill to fully describe his beauty. He concludes that those who see the subject today are struck with wonder, but they are incapable of praising him adequately."

In the first lines, the poet describes how her narrator lives her life. She goes into detail about how alone she feels in her world, and how she sees no possible change in her future. Before long a change miraculously does occur and her outlook on her future expands. She can suddenly see into the distance in a way she never could before. She sees homes, hills, mountains, and dense forests. The speaker is able to gain a greater understanding of how the rest of the world lives, while she still resides alone. In the final lines, she states that this new sight has empowered her with a new closeness. She feels ownership over the lands, sea, and by the last two lines, the whole world."

The poem begins with the speaker asking a number of questions. The answer to each one of these is “never.” The wind will never stop blowing, the clouds will never stop “fleeting” and the heart of humankind will never become “aweary of beating.” In the second section he goes on to state that the future is going to bring change, but that does not necessarily mean the end. As nothing can die, change only brings on a different form of life. Spring will always return, in one way or another, and revitalize the earth. In the final lines the summarizes his previous points, coming to the final conclusion that everything will change, nothing was ever born that didn't already exist, and that nothing can ever truly die as all life returns to the earth."

It was he, after all, who penned the line ‘Life is slow dying’ in his poem Nothing to be Said, and in Dockery and Son he observes: ‘Life is first boredom, then fear’. Too much Larkin could have you reaching for the hemlock, but beneath his pessimism and acerbic wit, he can write some beautiful stuff too. Alas, ‘Afternoons’ sees him in less than chipper humour, casting a cynical eye on suburban life. Never the most paternal, he says of his contemporary in Dockery and Son: ‘Why did he think that adding meant increase?/To me it was dilution.’ Afternoons, and its dreary depiction of domestic life, would seem to sum up this sentiment. This poem was published in Larkin’s anthology ‘The Whitsun Weddings’."

The poet takes the reader through seemingly disconnected and certainly quite vague images in the five stanzas of the poem. He speaks on trees, connectivity, understanding one's world, and the paradoxes inherent in trying to do so. The speaker mentions his relationship with another person, even referring to them as “you” at one point. Their relationship is lacking something, an understanding or connection, that he knows should be there. He sees it in the trees. They are surrounded by the ability to come tougher and know one another but also noise and extraneous information."

While this tactic could easily be seen as a method of venting and confronting pain, the result of the strategy could also be that the reader learns of the underlying guilt the narrator is repeatedly trying to push down and the hostility residing within that narrator. Combined, this blend does not make for a trustworthy narrator, which means the reader could conclude that there is no reason to believe the narrator’s account. With that result, the flower-sender could actually be the one in the right. The possibility also exists that this poem truly is a venting session that is meant to do nothing but express deeply rooted frustration, but the contradictions feel a bit too grand for that to definitively be the case.

Overall, ‘Nightstand with Roses’ can be seen as an example of when consideration needs to be applied to claims so that the truth does not get overrun by strong emotions and hurtful reactions."

In the past, it was used for people of a specific character trait. Those who preferred greed over savings, lust over their need. Especially a person who thinks of enjoying life in debt, rather than thinking of curbing their needs, is a Jack Sprat. Like several nursery rhymes, it may have originated as a satire on a public figure. According to historian Linda Alchin, Jack was King Charles I who was left “lean” as the parliament denied him taxation. With his queen Henrietta Maria, he “licked the platter clean” by dissolving the parliament. Apart from that, King Charles was short in height. This saying also applies to the popular Robin Hood legend. In the legend, John can be compared with King John. While his greedy queen Isabella is comparable to Jack's wife. In this way, the term was popularized for having a connection with a political figure and a king from a popular legend. This saying was included in the canon of nursery rhymes in English when it was published in “Mother Goose's Melody” around 1765. In 1797, it appeared in Samuel Arnold's “Juvenile Amusement.”"

The poem begins with the speaker stating that there is a place, a “country,” in which animals have human faces. This place is noted for its lack of distinction between human and non-human animals. Here, the foxes are not hunted, the cats are “ceremonial” and the bulls are allowed to die valiant deaths. All creatures can flourish and reach their highest potential."

That theme is that “life” is better “live[d]” than discussed, so much that he has chosen to not “writ[e]” “the poem” of his “life.” Instead, he chose to “live.”"

I saw a garden

In a rain-blue, silken garment.
She reached through the water
To pluck the crimson peonies
Beneath the surface,
But as she grasped the stems,
They jarred and broke into white-green ripples,
And as she drew out her hand,
The water-drops dripping from it
Stained her rain-blue dress like tears.","The woman sat beside the water in a rain-blue, silken garment","In the poem 'Chinoiseries,' Amy Lowell gazes at a Chinese artwork and describes the features depicted on it. In this poem, a speaker gets lost in a chinoiserie art. She sees a garden with “peonies” and “tinkling pagodas.” The speaker then sees a woman sitting by a still lake. She bends forward and reaches the crimson peonies that are beautiful to look at. As soon as she grasps the flower stems, the flowers break in her hands. The poet uses her expert imagery to illustrate how people often spoil the things they admire/desire, and that is a lesson that is well illustrated in the poem."

Eventually, this man dies and entrusts the child to another. They carry on in this way for a time, before, sick, tired, and starving, the men consider leaving the child behind.

The first part deals with his admiration for the 'Pike', which comes at the beginning of the poem where the poet describes the size and color of the Pike with its grandeur by nature. He then keeps on admiring the beauty and the presence of the fish in the water. He gives visual imagery of how it lives in its natural habitat. The second part is about his reminiscence of childhood where he visited the Lakh frequently and his experience of the three fish he and his friends grew at home. That experience gave him the lesson that the strong ones survive in the world whereas the weaker ones must succumb to their fate of being eaten by the healthy one. The third part discusses his respect and fear for the fish, whose eyes and malevolent grin still haunting him at night."

This poem begins with a dialogue between a mother and her child. The child has come across a butterfly. Therefore the child asks her mother why it is so proud of its wings. What the mother tells her son is the subject matter of this poem. The first stanza contrasts a caterpillar crawling near the butterfly. In the second stanza, the mother assures her son that the creature was blessed with the wings as it bore the pain of being a caterpillar previously. The caterpillar-stage of one's life is the vital time to invest in oneself. So, one has to be as steady as a caterpillar until he or she becomes as beautiful as a winged butterfly!"

Dylan depicts the nature of war through their conversation. 'John Brown' by Bob Dylan presents an imaginary story about John Brown who has become a soldier and how he gets injured in an “old-fashioned war”. The conversation between the mother of John Brown and his soldier son depicts how common people respect the magnitude of such a nationalistic service. But, in the end, they both suffer, the son physically and his mother mentally, for the war in which they have invested so much fascination and passion. Ironically, the war offers them some medals only along with lifelong suffering and agony."

By happiness? And shall I let all go,

The poem begins with the speaker devoting a number of lines to the natural beauty around him. It is limitless. There are birds, drops of still wet dew, and other sights and sounds that take him out of his body and make him wish he had a greater part of nature's glory inside him. Over the next lines, he discusses his desire to take in nature and learn to embody some of its wisdom and or strength. Through this process, it is likely the speaker was hoping to understand the world better. As Thomas was obviously a poet, many assume this was to be done through writing. In the final lines, he succumbs to the realization that he is never going to be able to reach nature's truth, or “bite the day to the core.” It is impossible for him to reach."

That is until you get to the final stanza, and it's revealed that Alice isn't a camel. She's a horse. It's this surprise that makes the poem as entertaining as it is.

It can be argued to be about love or the impossibility of achievement. Although both are valid, I prefer the second reading as it aligns with Bukowski's own personal opinions. He examines moments of achievement, those 'best moments' in which you are having the 'greatest time'. Yet, there is always something that can top that achievement, always something that comes next. Bukowski urges the reader to stop always wanting more and more, instead be content with living 'in that space'. You will never be full, there will always be a hole, but you must learn to live with that. Bukowski is notoriously bleak, with this poem being no different, the poet essentially telling the reader to stop trying so hard in life as the journey is endless anyway."

That is not the case, however. The words of this poem are spoken by the speaker to his own body in the form of various commands. He speaks softly and tenderly to his own body, but they are commands nonetheless. The speaker does not feel that he is one with his body, but rather that he is a separate mind that must tell his body what to do. The old man in this poem is praying in the opening lines, but the prayers he spoke and whether or not they were answered have nothing to do with the purpose of After Prayers, Lie Cold. The title of this poem itself is a command the speaker gives to his body. The comma placed after the word “prayers” in the title is very strategic. The speaker is not suggesting that the prayers themselves lie cold. Rather, he is commanding his own body to lie cold after the prayers have been spoken. The context of the rest of the poem gives greater insight into why the speaker is talking to his body, and why he wishes it to lie cold. The title simply gives foreshadowing into the meaning and purpose of After Prayers, Lie Cold."

He never leaves his home, the visits from Guardado being his only form of company. The poem is somber, exploring loneliness with a bitter resentment. Guardado doesn't want to see this man ever again, knowing that his life has faded into nothingness. It is an incredibly sad depiction of the elderly, Guardado giving up on her grandfather and deciding to stop visiting him. Much like the fish that is 'defenseless… in air', she knows her grandfather will never leave his home, continuing on this depressing pathway until the very end."

The three stanzas of 'The Bean Eaters' take the reader into the lives of an older couple who are spending their last days alone together eating beans. The beans are only one way in which Brooks depicts their poverty in the text. They can't afford much, making do with the broken plates and old furniture they have in their rented room. The two drift into the background at the end of the poem as the speaker focuses on their meager belongings. They are forgotten by the reader, just as they've been forgotten by everyone else."

The action of sleeping will be associated with a place of wellness and calmness in comparison with the troubles of the daytime. Therefore, throughout the poem, there will be a constant tension between the daytime and the nighttime. ‘To Sleep’ will also depict a distance between these two antagonistic spaces that we already mentioned. Furthermore, the action of sleeping represents a new kind of experience that the lyrical voice will evoke and yearn in ‘To Sleep’. Moreover, the action of sleeping will be a metaphor for death. In ‘To Sleep’, the moment of rest will be similar to a sort of death, which brings a state of pleasure and joy to the lyrical voice."

'The Pig' by Ogden Nash is a light poem that briefly talks about what the pig supplies to men. Items like sausage, ham, and bacon are the products of pig's meat. Sausage is an item of food that is made from minced pork packed cylindrically in the pig's skin. It is typically sold raw or fried before eating. Whereas, ham is salted or smoked meat. It is prepared from the upper part of a pig's leg. Lastly, bacon is a cured meat obtained from the back or sides of a pig. Thereafter, in the poem, Ogden Nash humorously refers to “big heart” as it generously gives such items to men. At the end of the poem, the poet ironically says that it is the stupidity of the pig."
1325,1336,1336,"By the shores of Gitche Gumee,
By yhr shining Big-Sea-Water,
Stood the wigwam of Nokomis,
Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis.
Dark behind it rose the forest,
Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees,
Rose the firs with cones upon them;
Bright before it beat the water,
Beat the clear and sunny water,
Beat the shingin Big-Set-Water.
There the wrinkled old Nokomis
Nursed the little Hiawatha,
Rocked him in his linden cradle,
Bedded soft in moss and rushes,
Safely bound with reindeer sinews;
Stilled his fretful wail by saying,
""Hush, the Naked Bear will hear thee!""
Lulled him into slumber, singing,
""Ewa-yea! my little owlet!
Who is this, that lights the wigwam?
With his great eyes lights the wigwam?
Ewa-yea! my little owlet!""
Many things Nokomis taught him
Of the stars that shin in heaven;
Showed him Ishkoodah, the comet,
Ishkoodah, with fiery tresses,
Showed the Death-Dance of the spritits,
Warriors with their plumes and war-clubs,
Flaring far away to norhtward
In the frosty nights ofwinder;
Showed the borad white road in heaven,
Pathway of the ghosts, the shadows,
Running straight across the heavens,
Crowded with the ghosts, the shadows.
At the door on summer evenings,
Sat the little Hiawatha,
Heard the whispering of the pine-trees,
Heard the lapping of the waters,
Sounds of music, words of wonder;
""Minne-wawa!"" said the pine-trees,
""Mudway-aushka!"" said the water.
Saw the fire-fly Wah-wah-taysee,
Flitting through the dusk of evening,
With the twinkle of its candle
Lighting up the brakes and bushes,
And he sang the song of children,
Sang the song Nokomis taught him:
""Wah-wah-taysee, little fire-fly,
Little flitting, white-fire insect,
Little, dancing, white-fire creature,
Light me with your little candle,
Ere upon my bed I lay me,
Ere in sleep I close my eyelids!""
Saw the moon rise from the water,
Rippling, rounding from the water,
Saw the flecks and shadows on it,
Whispered, ""What is that, Nokomis?""
And the good Nokomis answered:
""Once a warrior, very angry,
Seized his grandmother, and threw her
Up into the sky at midnight;
Right against the moon he threw her;
'Tis her body that you see there.""
Saw the rainbow in the heaven,
In the eastern sky the rainbow,
Whispered, ""What is that, Nokomis?""
And the good Nokomis answered:
""'Tis the heaven of flowers you see there;
All the wild-flowers of the forest,
All the lilies of the prairie,
When on earth they fade and perish,
Blossom in that heaven above us.',
When he heard the owls at midnight,
Hooting, laughing in the forest,
""What is that?"" he cried in terror;
""What is that,"" he said, ""Nokomis?""
And the good Nokomis answered:
""That is but the owl and owlet,
Talking in their native language,
Talking, scolding at each other.""
Then the little Hiawatha
Learned of every bird its language,
Learned their names and all their secrets,
How they built their nests in summer,
Where they hid themselves in winter,
Talked with them whene'er he met them,
Called them ""Hiawatha's Chickens.""
Of all beasts he learned the language,
Learned their names and all their secrets,
How the beavers built their lodges,

Throughout the rest of the poem, the poet describes how Hiawatha was raised, what he learned, and how he drew close to all the living creatures around him. He learned what to be frightened of and what not to be frightened of from his grandmother, as well as details regarding how all the creatures in his environment lived."
1326,1337,1337,"No one could say how the tiger got into the menagerie.

The menagerie is a metaphor for our society, and the tiger a representation “wildness” or anger being introduced into what is considered a civilized group. The tiger becomes a part of the menagerie and the menagerie is changed because of his presence. The tiger/“wildness” gets out, and although no one can understand how, they all experience it and are changed by this introduction of anger to their hearts. Just as human beings are changed when they first allow anger to control their actions. This poem is a warning and also a foretelling of the coming of violence, and the damage it will cause. "

1328,1339,1339,"From a rooftop in Johannesburg
the hadedah ibis watches the city’s smoggy skyline,
and wonders at the irony
that the fate of the earth
rests in the wings of an ugly bird.

With its long, crooked beak
it pecks at the dirt and grass,
sounding a shrill cry
that echoes in the stillness of the afternoon.

It is a scavenger, a survivor,
a creature of the margins,
living where others dare not venture,
making do with what it can find.

And yet, in its own way,
it is a king of sorts,
ruling over a patch of sky,
patrolling its territory with pride.

For all its gruff exterior,
the hadedah is a creature of beauty,
its feathers iridescent in the sun,
a wonder to behold.

And as it takes to the air,
soaring high above the city,
it is a reminder
of the wildness that still exists,
of the power of nature,
and of the resilience of life.

So let us take heart from the hadedah,
let us learn from its example,
and let us cherish the earth,
so that this ugly bird,
this king of the margins,
may continue to soar.","The hadedah ibis is a scavenger,","'Hadedah' by Adam Schwartzman gives a reader an overview of the history and current state of South Africa from the perspective of a hadeda ibis.

The bird is not a creature the speaker has taken a lot of time to understand and now he wonders why that is. They are common throughout South Africa, even living in cities. He follows one particular bird up into the sky where it joins others. From here on the poem focuses on the land itself. The speaker describes the types of places the birds fly over. He speaks on the geographical features, cultural significance, and death present on the ground far below the birds. The last lines take the ibises away from South Africa and away from the world."

The poem begins with the speaker describing the power of the sun in the morning. The dawn comes and the light and warmth drive off the shadows of the night. All of the layers of mist that covered the landscape and obscured the speaker's view are removed. He describes the light as being powerful and omnipresent, just as God is. In the second half of 'Prayer at Sunrise', the speaker turns his words to God, praying for the joy and strength to make it through the day. He also asks that he be able to impart some of his strength to the strength-less and his joy to the joyless. There is nothing else he wants, other than to help others when he can and make it through life himself."

The female speaker starts out the poem mournfully wondering why she doesn't have anyone to share her bed or hold her hand. She doesn't have a man, and that bothers her. A male speaker picks up the lines next, telling her that she doesn't have a “head,” and that's the issue. If she were smart enough, she'd know what she needed to do to attract a man. She, in her desperation, asks him to tell her exactly what it is that she needs to do. In the final stanza, he tells her that she needs to share her bed and her money. The latter is emphasized, suggesting that what the man can take from the woman is what's really important."

1332,1343,1343,"This house has been far out at sea all night,
The woods crashing through darkness, the booming hills,
Winds stampeding the fields under the window
Floundering black astride and blinding wet

Till day rose; then under an orange sky
The hills had new places, and wind wielded
Blade-light, luminous black and emerald,
Flexing like the lens of a mad eye.

At noon I scaled along the house-side as far as
The coal-house door. Once I looked up -
Through the brunt wind that dented the balls of my eyes
The tent of the hills drummed and strained its guyrope,

The fields quivering, the skyline a grimace,
At any second to bang and vanish with a flap;
The wind flung a magpie away and a black-
Back gull bent like an iron bar slowly. The house

Rang like some fine green goblet in the note
That any second would shatter it. Now deep
In chairs, in front of the great fire, we grip
Our hearts and cannot entertain book, thought,

Or each other. We watch the fire blazing,
And feel the roots of the house move, but sit on,
Seeing the window tremble to come in,
Hearing the stones cry out under the horizons.","The house has been far out at sea all night, The woods crashing through darkness,","Wind' takes place over the course of one night: a family, cowering inside a house, listen as a fierce storm rampages outside. 'Wind' is both within and out of Hughes' normal writing style. Most of his most formidable works of poetry take place within such suspended periods but personify the moment using animals. In 'Wind' there is nothing even vaguely humanistic present throughout the poem, thus lending to it an air of almost complete animosity and luck. The people at the mercy of nature cannot do anything but wait for the night to end, and in a jump from his regular style, Hughes is not interested in describing this act of nature in the loving detail that he has shown in works such as 'The Thought-Fox'. Instead, the description is written through action: what happens and what doesn't, leaving the image to develop inside the reader's mind without adding very many adjectives. It works well for this poem. The detailed actions provide enough that the reader can imagine the house and the family, the vibrant anger of nature, the terrifying power it wields, and how helpless man is in the face of it. "

And prayers to them who sit above?

The poem begins with the speaker, who is also the writer himself, addressing the fact that he has been dead for a thousand years whenever anyone will read his words. He wrote this message so that he could communicate with the future after he has died. In the next stanza, the poet tells his reader what he does not care to know about the future. He does not want to spend time learning about the buildings or what they are made of. He also does not care to know about the technological advances made by humankind. In the third stanza, he speaks on what he does care about. He is curious whether or not there is still passionate love, wine, and art in the future. The poet also wants to know if there has been any progress in understanding the meaning of life or the place of God. The poem begins to draw to its conclusion when the speaker asks if the world has aged as Homer believed it would. In the second to last stanza, he describes how he knows his reader will be similar to him. They will both be students of English and poets who were once young. The final stanza fun describes the speaker's intention. He wants this poem to be a handshake across the years. It will bring with it the poet's soul with which he will “greet” future writers."
1334,1345,1345,"A tulip, just opened, had offered to hold
A butterfly, gaudy and gay;
And, rocked in a cradle of crimson and gold,
The careless young slumberer lay.
For the butterfly slept, as such thoughtless ones will,
At ease, and reclining on flowers,
If ever they study, ’t is how they may kill
The best of their mid-summer hours.
And the butterfly dreamed, as is often the case
With indolent lovers of change,
Who, keeping the body at ease in its place,
Give fancy permission to range.
He dreamed that he saw, what he could but despise,
The swarm from a neighbouring hive;
Which, having come out for their winter supplies,
Had made the whole garden alive.
He looked with disgust, as the proud often do,
On the diligent movements of those,
Who, keeping both present and future in view,
Improve every hour as it goes.
As the brisk little alchymists passed to and fro,
With anger the butterfly swelled;
And called them mechanics – a rabble too low
To come near the station he held.
‘Away from my presence!’ said he, in his sleep,
‘Ye humbled plebeians! nor dare
Come here with your colorless winglets to sweep
The king of this brilliant parterre!’
He thought, at these words, that together they flew,
And, facing about, made a stand;
And then, to a terrible army they grew,
And fenced him on every hand.
Like hosts of huge giants, his numberless foes
Seemed spreading to measureless size:
Their wings with a mighty expansion arose,
And stretched like a veil o’er the skies.
Their eyes seemed like little volcanoes, for fire,— Their hum, to a cannon-peal grown,—
Farina to bullets was rolled in their ire,
And, he thought, hurled at him and his throne.
He tried to cry quarter! his voice would not sound,
His head ached – his throne reeled and fell;
His enemy cheered, as he came to the ground,
And cried, ‘King Papilio, farewell!’
His fall chased the vision – the sleeper awoke,
The wonderful dream to expound;
The lightning’s bright flash from the thunder-cloud broke,
And hail-stones were rattling around.
He’d slumbered so long, that now, over his head,
The tempest’s artillery rolled;
The tulip was shattered – the whirl-blast had fled,
And borne off its crimson and gold.

With suppressed ebullitions of pride,

But he crept under covert and died.","A butterfly, just opened, had offered to hold A butterfly, gaudy and gay","'The Butterfly's Dream' by Hannah F. Gould is a poem about a haughty butterfly and how it meets with a tragic event after waking up from its daydream. In this poem, the poet talks about a butterfly that takes a nap on a tulip. In its dream, the butterfly sees a swarm of bees coming out of their hive in search of winter's provision. Thereafter, seeing them, it gets agitated for its excessive pride in itself. Hence the butterfly orders them to leave the place as they are mere “plebeians” below its dignity. Therefore those bees get angry and topple the butterfly from its metaphorical throne. Seeing this dream, the butterfly wakes up in frustration. Incidentally, there occurs a hailstorm and thrashes everything. At last, the butterfly finding no place to hide dies at the end of the poem."

The very first part of the poem has a metaphor, when the poet regards fish as “promises” escaping through weeds. Besides, there is also the use of an evocative image, when Elizabeth says “Fill their eyes with water”, which brings to light the patience of the older fishermen who keep sitting solid on the bank of the river just in the hope of catching a fish. In all, the poet has tried to shed light on two different themes of the poem. The first one is the attitude of each generation towards the river, and the second is how both generations of older and newer fishermen think towards life. In addition, the poet has also tried to bring into light the relationship between younger and older generations towards the river. The poet says where the one regards it merely as a source of fishing enjoyment, while the older generation considers it to be their only source of livelihood."

Lawrence is a short poem that compares domestic conflict and abuse to a storm outside the house. In the first lines, the speaker begins by describing a terrible storm raging outside. It appears these events happened in the past, so the speaker is recalling (or creating) these descriptions. Specifically, he recalls how when the wind increased and the branches of the tree became whip-like and pounded the sides of the house. The branches moved through the air, making shrieking noising as if trying to slash at the wind. He compares the wind and branches, through a simile, to how the rigging of a ship might sound as the vessel tosses amongst the waves. Just how outside the house the storm is whipping through the tree, battering it in the wind and creating terrible shrieking noises, something similar is happening inside. There are “Two voices,” a mother's and a father's, who in anger raise their voices. As the poem concludes it becomes clear that one voice, the father's, overcame the mother's. The final image is of the “silence of blood”."

The peace of utter light
And silence. For no breeze may stir
Along the steady flight
Of seraphim; no echo there,
Beyond all depth or height.
Heard hardly, some of her new friends,
Playing at holy games,
Spake gentle-mouth'd, among themselves,
Their virginal chaste names;
And the souls, mounting up to God,
Went by her like thin flames.
And still she bow'd herself, and stoop'd
Into the vast waste calm;
Till her bosom's pressure must have made
The bar she lean'd on warm,
And the lilies lay as if asleep
Along her bended arm.
From the fixt lull of Heaven, she saw
Time, like a pulse, shake fierce
Through all the worlds. Her gaze still strove,
In that steep gulf, to pierce
The swarm; and then she spoke, as when
The stars sang in their spheres.
'I wish that he were come to me,
For he will come,' she said.
'Have I not pray'd in solemn Heaven?
On earth, has he not pray'd?
Are not two prayers a perfect strength?
And shall I feel afraid?
'When round his head the aureole clings,
And he is clothed in white,
I'll take his hand, and go with him
To the deep wells of light,
And we will step down as to a stream
And bathe there in God's sight.
'We two will stand beside that shrine,
Occult, withheld, untrod,
Whose lamps tremble continually
With prayer sent up to God;
And where each need, reveal'd, expects
Its patient period.
'We two will lie i' the shadow of
That living mystic tree
Within whose secret growth the Dove
Sometimes is felt to be,
While every leaf that His plumes touch
Saith His name audibly.
'And I myself will teach to him,—
I myself, lying so,—
The songs I sing here; which his mouth
Shall pause in, hush'd and slow,
Finding some knowledge at each pause,
And some new thing to know.'
(Alas! to her wise simple mind
These things were all but known
Before: they trembled on her sense,—
Her voice had caught their tone.
Alas for lonely Heaven! Alas
For life wrung out alone!
Alas, and though the end were reach'd?...
Was thy part understood
Or borne in trust? And for her sake
Shall this too be found good?—
May the close lips that knew not prayer
Praise ever, though they would?)
'We two,' she said, 'will seek the groves
Where the lady Mary is,
With her five handmaidens, whose names
Are five sweet symphonies:—
Cecily, Gertrude, Magdalen,
Margaret and Rosalys.
'Circle-wise sit they, with bound locks
And bosoms covered;
Into the fine cloth, white like flame,
Weaving the golden thread,
To fashion the birth-robes for them
Who are just born, being dead.
'He shall fear, haply, and be dumb.
Then I will lay my cheek
To his, and tell about our love,
Not once abash'd or weak:
And the dear Mother will approve
My pride, and let me speak.
'Herself shall bring us, hand in hand,
To Him round whom all souls
Kneel—the unnumber'd solemn heads
Bow'd with their aureoles:
And Angels, meeting us, shall sing
To their citherns and citoles.
'There will I ask of Christ the Lord
Thus much for him and me:—
To have more blessing than on earth
In nowise; but to be
As then we were,—being as then
At peace. Yea, verily.
'Yea, verily; when he is come
We will do thus and thus:
Till this my vigil seem quite strange
And almost fabulous;
We two will live at once, one life;
And peace shall be with us.'
She gazed, and listen'd, and then said,
Less sad of speech than mild,—
'All this is when he comes.' She ceased:
The light thrill'd past her, fill'd
With Angels, in strong level lapse.
Her eyes pray'd, and she smiled.
(I saw her smile.) But soon their flight
Was vague 'mid the poised spheres.
And then she cast her arms along
The golden barriers,
And laid her face between her hands,
And wept. (I heard her tears.)",Damozel lean'd out from the gold bar of Heaven: Her blue grave eyes,"“The Blessed Damozel” by Dante Gabriel Rossetti is a ballad that is dedicated to the love between a woman trapped in heaven and a man stuck on Earth. 'The Blessed Damozel' begins with the speaker describing a woman who, leaning out from heaven, can be seen holding lilies in her hands. She is breathtakingly beautiful but also melancholy. It soon becomes clear that she left someone on Earth. There is a lover, who's lines are written in the first person and contained within parenthesis, which is heartbroken by her departure. They pine for one another across the extraordinarily vast expanse between the “ramparts” of “God's house,” on which she is leaning, and Earth. The damsel, sounding like bird song, speaks out loud for all to hear. She describes the love that the two share and how soon, because they have both prayed for it, they will be reunited. God will bring them together. Once her beloved arrives in heaven she will show him all there is to see. They will meet the Virgin Mary and she will introduce them to Christ who will bless their love. The two will be able to finally live in the peace and solitude they did not get to experience on Earth. Unfortunately, this is just a dream and after returning to reality the damsel breaks down crying once more at their separation."

My den is all a cosy glow;
And snug before the fire I sit,
And wait to feel the old year go.
I dedicate to solemn thought
Amid my too-unthinking days,
This sober moment, sadly fraught
With much of blame, with little praise.
Old Year! upon the Stage of Time
You stand to bow your last adieu;
A moment, and the prompter’s chime
Will ring the curtain down on you.
Your mien is sad, your step is slow;
You falter as a Sage in pain;
Yet turn, Old Year, before you go,
And face your audience again.
That sphinx-like face, remote, austere,
Let us all read, whate’er the cost:
O Maiden! why that bitter tear?
Is it for dear one you have lost?
Is it for fond illusion gone?
For trusted lover proved untrue?
O sweet girl-face, so sad, so wan
What hath the Old Year meant to you?
And you, O neighbour on my right
So sleek, so prosperously clad!
What see you in that aged wight
That makes your smile so gay and glad?
What opportunity unmissed?
What golden gain, what pride of place?
What splendid hope? O Optimist!
What read you in that withered face?
And You, deep shrinking in the gloom,
What find you in that filmy gaze?
What menace of a tragic doom?
What dark, condemning yesterdays?
What urge to crime, what evil done?
What cold, confronting shape of fear?
O haggard, haunted, hidden One
What see you in the dying year?
And so from face to face I flit,
The countless eyes that stare and stare;
Some are with approbation lit,
And some are shadowed with despair.
Some show a smile and some a frown;
Some joy and hope, some pain and woe:
Enough! Oh, ring the curtain down!
Old weary year! it's time to go.
My pipe is out, my glass is dry;
My fire is almost ashes too;
But once again, before you go,
And I prepare to meet the New:
Old Year! a parting word that’s true,
For we’ve been comrades, you and I—
I thank God for each day of you;
There! bless you now! Old Year, good-bye!","I dedicate to solemn thought Amid my too-unthinking days, This so","'The Passing of the Year' by Robert Service is a lovely poem about the passing of the year and a new beginning. 'The Passing of the Year' by Robert Service begins with the poet sitting by the fireplace, drinking, and smoking a pipe. He broods upon the dying year and what it has in store. The “Old Year” appears upon the “Stage of Time” bidding adieu to the audience. Moreover, the poet sees the sad face of a lady, a happy old man, and a gloomy-faced person. Each face has something present to the poet. However, the poet feels enough after musing on the dying year that has nothing more. Hence, he expresses his gratitude for the year for its comradeship. With a smile, he bids the Old Year a warm good-bye."

You may give them your love but not your thoughts,
For they have their own thoughts.
You may house their bodies but not their souls,

In this piece, readers can find Al Mustafa is asked by a woman to enlighten them about children. Previously, he has talked about love and marriage. In this section, he explores how parents should think about their kids. Firstly, he makes it clear that the children don't belong to the parents at all. They are part of the divine being and come into this world through their parents. They have to bring up their children and provide them nourishment. But, they should not impose their thoughts on them as they have their thoughts. If parents try to shape their minds with their ideas, they are eliminating the inherent power of their souls. Al Mustafa uses a metaphor of bow and arrow to clarify the role of parents in their children's lives. According to him, parents are the bow of the almighty and children are the arrows. Using them, the almighty sends forth the arrows to the mark placed at infinite distance. It is a metaphorical reference to the universal soul. In this way, Gibran explores the ideal way of parenting through this piece."

The speaker begins by stating that no matter what she does, she is unable to bring the world and its elements any closer to her being. She wants to “hold” the earth to her for as long, and as intimately, as she can. She goes on to describe a number of parts of the world she finds the most moving. She speaks of the winds, mists, woods, and cliffs which are too heavy for her to lift. In the final section, she turns her words to God. The speaker informs him that she is full to bursting with emotions, and that he may have made the world too beautiful this year. Her soul is trying to leave her body. The speaker pleads with God, and the world, not to let her see a falling autumn leaf nor hear a bird's call. If this happens, she believes she will not be able to handle it."

The others, day or night.","Dark is the forest and deep, and overhead Hang stars like seeds of light In vain,","The Dark Forest' by Edward Thomas is a beautiful, haunting poem about life, death, and our inability to commune with those on the opposite side. Through the image of the forest, and all that which resides within and around it, Thomas depicts the gulf that separates the living from the dead. One group, the living, picks marguerite flowers in the light/day while the others pick purple foxglove in the deep, darkness of the forest. The separation of life and death is also seen through the pinpoints of light, the stars, in the sky."

Chesterton is told from the perspective of the self-hating donkey Christ rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. In the first lines of this piece, the speaker begins by stating that as he was born he was made into something ugly. It was an unnerving time with a blood-red moon and flying fish. This adds to the strangeness around the donkey's character. He speaks of himself in hateful and dark language. It is clear that before the events of the last stanza he had a negative opinion of his place in the world. The poem concludes with the donkey describing how he was finally recognized by the masses. It was when Christ rode him into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. Suddenly, everyone loved donkeys as they were forever tied to this story."

reclining underneath a tree:
she's about half naked and little by little

I'm sprinkling her burial mounds
with grass. This is the kind of work

I like. It lets me remember, and so
I do. I remember the time I laid

my homemade banjo in the fire
and let it burn. There was nothing else

to burn and the house was cold;
the cigar box curled inside the flames.

But the burst of heat was over soon,
and once the little roar was done,

I could hear the raindrops plopping up
the buckets and kettles, scattered out

like little ponds around the room.
It was night and I was a boy, alone

and left to listen to that old music.
I liked it. I've liked it ever since.

I loved the helpless people I loved.
That's what a little boy will do,

about another kind of love,

He first discusses a 'waking dream' in which he saw a woman, and sprinkled her 'burial mound', the ground around her, with 'grass'. The second memory he explores is while he was much younger. As a boy, he is sat in a house that has a leaky roof. He is enjoying the sound of a banjo burning on the fire as water drips into buckets around him. It is a sound that he loves, but one that brings back sad memories. The poet then returns to the present, he is sitting underneath a 'tree' and laughing at the first memory. Manning writes an incredibly tragic poem, the words dripping with loneliness and sorrow, as equally moving and beautiful."

The first two stanzas of the text describe a storm in an unknown location. Whatever place the speaker is thinking of, the natural world is beaten back and tossed around by raging winds and rain. The second stanza describes two travelers, a man, and a girl, who is forced to contend with these terrible conditions. The final stanza uses a first-person narrative perspective and conveys the speaker's gratitude for his safe home life."

This poem begins with a simple wish of Hughes' speaker. He wants to create a piece that is metaphorically about the daybreak in Alabama. In the first few lines, Hughes describes this song as a representation of nature itself. The song rises out like swamp mist and falls from heaven like dew. It contains the faces and hands of colored people. Not only that, the white people have a place in the poet's song. He wishes everyone to be kind to others. In this way, it will eventuate the new dawn in Alabama."

The unused instrument sits in the attic, Nelson not having anyone to love. By the end of the poem, Nelson suggests that she has not lost hope. Instead, she is just waiting for the right person to 'pluck notes' from her body once again."

Once they are out of earshot, Age wishes the children happiness and hopes that they will “seize the day”. The narrator of the poem then states that Age has given poetry the burden of warning lovers against the danger of being full of happiness, but not realizing it. The poem ends with the narrator stating that life lives less in the present and more in the past. This is because the present is often too overwhelming and fast-paced for people to really enjoy it."

Merwin is a beautiful, short poem about what it's like to miss someone who is absent from your life. The poem's first line addresses someone's absence. It's unclear, and it remains undefined who the speaker is and what their relationship is to the listener (who is only addressed as “you”). They miss this person and feel that their absence is “like” thread through a needle. This unusual and likely unexpected comparison needs explaining. The speaker does so in the final line of the poem when they note that just like a thread through a piece of fabric, the listener's absence runs through their life constantly and changes everything they do.

This glorious scene represents both the end and beginning of life. It is the force from which everything emerges. There is also a bird present, a “fire-fangled” phoenix representing rebirth and one's inherent composition as a combination of every element from conceptualized birth to death. He goes on to state that happiness and unhappiness are not caused by an “it.” These two parts of life, which seem at points to be so far apart, always exist within the world. They are universal and transcend life and death. The poem concludes with the speaker noting again the images of the palm, bird, and the wind. They stand, like sentinels at the end of everything.

The poem begins with Larkin utilizing a passage from Henry Mayhew's work, London Labour and the London Poor. The selection comes from a young woman who was raped. She tells of her distress after the attack was over. This creates a setting for the poem and informs a reader before the text even begins that the events depicted will be graphic, or at least emotionally straining. In the first stanza, he describes how the woman's grief was forced upon her. It is something the speaker is able to “taste” now and is doing his best to convey. He also describes the sights and sounds around London that might've made their way into the room where the woman was raped. The world was going on without her. In the second stanza, he spends time discussing the issue that plague the rapist. He thought that by attacking this woman that his desire would be sated. He was deceived, as the title suggests. His deception is said to be worse than that suffered by the woman. This implies that the woman was tricked into the situation in which she was attacked."

It is a personal poem in which Das’s love for her parental house in Malabar is movingly described. Kamala presents a comparative picture of her life at her ancestral home in Malabar and her life in cities. The poetess glorifies the rural life but condemns the urban life in this poem. She finds herself totally alienated in the city, but is always firmly rooted in the rural life of Malabar. This poem is a powerful articulation of Kamala Dass’s feminine sensibility. The poet has given us the exact feel of the Indian locale in ‘A Hot Noon in Malabar”. The poem is rich in creating the typical colour of life in Kerala. No attempt has been made for the romantic glorification of life in Malabar. The beggars have “whining voices”, fortune cards are “stained with time”, kurava girls have “old eyes”, bangles are “covered with dust of the road”, feet are “cracked” causing “grating and strange” noise and strangers have “mistrust” in their eyes”.

They shake their heads. Dusk brims the shadows.
Summer by summer all stole away,
The starting-gates, the crowd and cries -
All but the unmolesting meadows.
Almanacked, their names live; they

Have slipped their names, and stand at ease,
Or gallop for what must be joy,
And not a fieldglass sees them home,
Or curious stop-watch prophesies :
Only the grooms, and the grooms boy,
With bridles in the evening come.","The eye can hardly pick them out From the cold shade they shelter in, Till wind distress","At Grass' by Philip Larkin speaks on the fate of two famous racehorses who have long since left the track and found a new home in a pasture. The poem begins with the speaker looking out over a field and noting how “they” are almost impossible to see at first. The ambiguity of “they” match the speaker's trouble in actually seeing them. The creatures' references are, of course, the two racehorses which feature as the main characters of the poem. When at one point they were the centre of everyone's attention, now they are only seen by the speaker. And even then, he sometimes finds it hard to spot them. He thinks about their past lives at the track and wonders if the memories of fame and acclaim haunt the horses. This line of thinking is quickly dismissed when he takes the time to see how at peace the horses truly are. They move about the pasture quietly and sometimes not at all. These movements are interpreted by Larkin's speaker to be those of joy. The horses no longer work for the crowd, nor are they overwhelmed with the sights and sounds of the track. He comes to the conclusion that the two once-famous horses are much happier to have escaped their names. Whatever achievements may have been theirs have been “almanacked” and packed away for others to worry about."

Thy death yet do them any good.

Nor do I for all this, nor will;
But if my simple pray’rs may yet
Prevail with Heaven to forget
Thy murder, I will join my tears
Rather than fail. But oh, my fears!

Ev’n beasts must be with justice slain,
Else men are made their deodands;
Though they should wash their guilty hands
In this warm life-blood, which doth part
From thine, and wound me to the heart,
Yet could they not be clean, their stain
Is dyed in such a purple grain.
There is not such another in
The world to offer for their sin.
Unconstant Sylvio, when yet
I had not found him counterfeit
One morning (I remember well)
Tied in this silver chain and bell,
Gave it to me; nay, and I know
What he said then; I’m sure I do.
Said he, “Look how your huntsman here
Hath taught a fawn to hunt his dear.”
But Sylvio soon had me beguil’d,
This waxed tame, while he grew wild;
And quite regardless of my smart,
Left me his fawn, but took his heart.
Thenceforth I set myself to play
My solitary time away,
With this, and very well content
Could so mine idle life have spent;
For it was full of sport, and light
Of foot and heart, and did invite
Me to its game; it seem’d to bless
Itself in me. How could I less
Than love it? Oh, I cannot be
Unkind t’ a beast that loveth me.
Had it liv’d long, I do not know
Whether it too might have done so
As Sylvio did; his gifts might be
Perhaps as false or more than he.
But I am sure, for aught that I
Could in so short a time espy,
Thy love was far more better then
The love of false and cruel men.
With sweetest milk and sugar first
I it at mine own fingers nurst;
And as it grew, so every day
It wax’d more white and sweet than they.
It had so sweet a breath! And oft
I blush’d to see its foot more soft
And white, shall I say than my hand?
Nay, any lady’s of the land.
It is a wond’rous thing how fleet
’Twas on those little silver feet;
With what a pretty skipping grace
It oft would challenge me the race;
And when ’t had left me far away,
’Twould stay, and run again, and stay,
For it was nimbler much than hinds,
And trod, as on the four winds.
I have a garden of my own,
But so with roses overgrown
And lilies, that you would it guess
To be a little wilderness;
And all the spring time of the year
It only loved to be there.
Among the beds of lilies I
Have sought it oft, where it should lie;
Yet could not, till itself would rise,
Find it, although before mine eyes;
For, in the flaxen lilies’ shade,
It like a bank of lilies laid.
Upon the roses it would feed
Until its lips ev’n seemed to bleed,
And then to me ’twould boldly trip
And print those roses on my lip.
But all its chief delight was still
On roses thus itself to fill,
And its pure virgin limbs to fold
In whitest sheets of lilies cold.
Had it liv’d long it would have been
Lilies without, roses within.
O help, O help! I see it faint,
And die as calmly as a saint.
See how it weeps! The tears do come,
Sad, slowly dropping like a gum.
So weeps the wounded balsam, so
The holy frankincense doth flow;
The brotherless Heliades
Melt in such amber tears as these.
I in a golden vial will
Keep these two crystal tears, and fill
It till it do o’erflow with mine,
Then place it in Diana’s shrine.
Now my sweet fawn is vanish’d to
Whither the swans and turtles go,
In fair Elysium to endure
With milk-white lambs and ermines pure.
O do not run too fast, for I
Will but bespeak thy grave, and die.
First my unhappy statue shall
Be cut in marble, and withal
Let it be weeping too; but there
Th’ engraver sure his art may spare,
For I so truly thee bemoan
That I shall weep though I be stone;
Until my tears, still dropping, wear
My breast, themselves engraving there.
There at my feet shalt thou be laid,
Of purest alabaster made;
For I would have thine image be
White as I can, though not as thee.","The wanton troopers riding by Have shot my fawn, and it will","'The Nymph Complaining For The Death Of Her Fawn' by Andrew Marvell is a sensuous elegy on the death of a pet fawn. 'The Nymph Complaining For The Death Of Her Fawn' by Andrew Marvell presents the tragic death of a fawn by some cruel soldiers. The owner of the fawn deplores the criminal deed of the soldiers to whom the fawn had not done any harm. The girl had never wished any harm to those men either and, in fact, even now she does not wish them any ill. She will even pray to God to forgive those men for their murderous deed, though it will not be possible for God to forgive them because God maintains a register of all the actions of his creatures. The murderers of this fawn will not be able to wash their hands clean of the blood they have shed. It was a rare fawn that is dying, and there will be no other fawn of the same quality which could be offered as a sacrifice to expiate the sin that has been committed."

The poem begins with the speaker describing a walk he took on a chilly night. Everything seems completely devoid of life as if the end times have come and the planet has been covered with darkness, death, and ice. The moon is going down as well, increasing the darkness with each passing second. The speaker is eventually drawn to a light in a bog or swamp. It turns out to be the glare from his dead lover's eyes. She too was drawn to this place but was unable to make it back and died there."

In the first section, the speaker describes how she woke one morning to screaming on the street and realized everything was on fire. She fled the house and watched as it, and all her possessions were destroyed. The speaker is at first thankful that she was saved from death by God. This is much more important to her than anything she lost. As time goes on though, she mourns for the physical items destroyed. She goes through all the objects and experiences which are now lost to her, from chests and trunks to meals with friends. The poem concludes with the speaker remembering that nothing is worth as much on earth as making one's way to heaven. That is where one's home truly is. It is a place which has no price. She re-devotes herself to loving God and forgetting her past."

Brown struggles with the place of memory in his life, it brought him back to moments in which he was abused. This repeats throughout his life, strange connections being drawn between his father, first lover, and last lover. Abuse seems to be a constant in Brown's life, occurring over and over again. Brown suggests that poetry is a form of processing emotion, one that can lead you away from these negative memories."

Of the first fierce words of war.

Till these noises again are dumb.

We thought of the dark, strange fight,

Lay dim in the beautiful night.

And of things with blinded eyes

Of the moon in those lighted skies;

In the dust with passion and moan,

In the silence of worlds unknown.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that it is was on a “dreamy summer” day that she first heard words of war. She knew that something was coming, but she wasn't sure what that “something” would be. The speaker and those around her cast out their thoughts about the battle that they are sure is raging nearby. They are consumed by feelings of “coldness and pallor.” In the second half of the poem the speaker wonders about those who are fighting in this battle. She imagines them spending everyday engaged with one another. In the final lines, she speaks directly to her listener and tells her/him to venture out into the battlefield and tell her how it is people are suffering. She needs to know the truth of the war."

No time to see, in broad daylight,
Streams full of stars, like skies at night:

No time to turn at Beauty's glance,
And watch her feet, how they can dance:

No time to wait till her mouth can
Enrich that smile her eyes began?

In this poem, Davies talks about the importance of being close to nature. The poem begins with some examples of what one can do to exhale the stress out of one's body. If one only cares about the body forgetting about how beautiful and soothing nature is, it will lead that person to spiritual poverty. Moreover, the poet makes use of imagery to portray the beauty of nature. All one has to do is to “stand and stare” at the simple activities of different creatures living close to nature."

He also uses the imagery of “black heralds” from death and a large guilty tear that represents everything that a “man” has lived."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is often taunted by others for the way he looked into a well. He was always on the wrong side. This meant his reflection obscured any chance he had of seeing deeper than the surface. This didn't bother him too much as he was taken in by his own image reflected alongside the clouds and sky. He looked “godlike” from this perspective. At one point though he saw something more. There was a flash of something white at the bottom of the well. He never saw it again but continued to speculate on what it was. He thought perhaps it was a rock, or maybe “Truth” itself.

Within this zoo is a gorilla, which becomes the subject of Wain’s poem. He likens the idle gorilla, bored in captivity, to a prisoner locked away in a cell. Some critics argue that the gorilla is actually a representation of the one prisoner who didn’t escape on Bastille Day on July 14th, 1789. The Bastille was designed to protect the eastern entrance to the city of Paris from the English during the Hundred Years’ War. It was also used as a prison, holding political dissidents who were often locked away without trials. ‘Au Jardin des Plantes’ draws together two similar concepts: prison and a zoo. John Wain’s ‘Au Jardin des Plantes’ uses the extended metaphor of a gorilla locked in captivity to explore the idleness of the prison system. Drawing parallels between the trapped animal and the idle man. Within this idea also arrises ideas of dehumanisation, with the imprisoning of a person stripping his fundamental rights as human – leaving him, in Wain’s words, an animal."

The poem begins by describing the ocean has having different sections. The deep and lonely recesses, such as “silent caves,” the furious waves on the surface, and the peaceful ocean floor. In the lonely parts of the ocean demons commune with one another but below them, where no other can tread, are the “young, the bright, the fair” the men that have been lost to the waters.They rest there “calmly,” in a world that is the equal of heaven.

Seibles moves towards introspection, wanting to make sure he is perceived a certain way throughout his life. As things happen so quickly, Seibles uses this poem as a way of trying to slow down, document his life and reassess his own journey. The poem culminates by repeating the key refrain, 'All you get to hold onto is a simple song at last', detailing that everything is lost in the end, but one can hold on to music."

and Miss Stillwagon (first name Linda I once heard) doesn’t even look up my balance for once in her life and in the GOLDEN GRIFFIN I get a little Verlaine for Patsy with drawings by Bonnard although I do think of Hesiod, trans.

of Genet, but I don’t, I stick with Verlaine

The poem takes the reader through the simple movements of a first persona narrator during one day of his life. The speaker, who is certainly O'Hara himself, goes from place to place. He lingers in a bookstore, buys liquor, and walks down the street. Finally, he is confronted with the news that Billie Holiday has passed away. This leads him to a nightclub where the poem ends."

And can't tell where to find them;
Leave them alone, and they'll come home,
Bringing their tails behind them.

Little Bo-Peep fell fast asleep,
And dreamt she heard them bleating;
But when she awoke, she found it a joke,
For they were still all fleeting.

Then up she took her little crook,
Determined for to find them;
She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,
For they'd left their tails behind them.

It happened one day, as Bo-Peep did stray
Into a meadow hard by,
There she espied their tails, side by side,
All hung on a tree to dry.

She heaved a sigh and wiped her eye,
And over the hillocks she raced;
And tried what she could, as a shepherdess should,
That each tail be properly placed.","Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep, And can't tell where to","'Little Bo-Peep' by Mother Goose is a children's nursery rhyme that tells the story of Bo-Peep a shepherdess, a flock of lost sheep, and their missing tails. The amusing, and at times dark, song describes how one-day Bo-Peep's sheep went missing She searched for them and found them, but they were without their tails. These too she found sometime later. Something happened to the sheep while they were missing the tails her hung up to dry. Bo-Peep grabs them and rushes off to get them reattached."
1370,1381,1381,"At last you yielded up the album, which
Once open, sent me distracted. All your ages
Matt and glossy on the thick black pages!
Too much confectionery, too rich:
I choke on such nutritious images.

In pigtails, clutching a reluctant cat;
Or furred yourself, a sweet girl-graduate;
Or lifting a heavy-headed rose
Beneath a trellis, or in a trilby-hat

From every side you strike at my control,
Not least through those these disquieting chaps who loll
At ease about your earlier days:
Not quite your class, I'd say, dear, on the whole.

But o, photography! as no art is,
Faithful and disappointing! that records
Dull days as dull, and hold-it smiles as frauds,
And will not censor blemishes
Like washing-lines, and Hall's-Distemper boards,

But shows a cat as disinclined, and shades
A chin as doubled when it is, what grace
Your candour thus confers upon her face!
How overwhelmingly persuades
That this is a real girl in a real place,

In every sense empirically true!
Or is it just the past? Those flowers, that gate,
These misty parks and motors, lacerate
Simply by being you; you
Contract my heart by looking out of date.

Yes, true; but in the end, surely, we cry
Not only at exclusion, but because
It leaves us free to cry. We know what was
Won't call on us to justify
Our grief, however hard we yowl across

The gap from eye to page. So I am left
To mourn (without a chance of consequence)
You, balanced on a bike against a fence;
To wonder if you'd spot the theft
Of this one of you bathing; to condense,

In short, a past that no one now can share,
No matter whose your future; calm and dry,
It holds you like a heaven, and you lie
Unvariably lovely there,
Smaller and clearer as the years go by.",A swivel eye hungers from pose to pose — In pigtail,"Lines On A Young Lady's Photograph Album' by Philip Larkin tells of a speaker's investigation of his lover's photo album. The poem begins with the speaker describing finally getting access to his lover's book of photos. She was looking at it, and he became entranced. As he flipped through the pages he got more and more emotional. The speaker came upon a number of photos from her youth, taking note of how she looked and which “chaps” hung around her. He passed a few judgments, but mostly relished in the access he now has to her life. The poem concludes with the speaker wondering over the power of the past, and feeling torn over the fact that he can't become a part of his lover's. Ultimately he comes to the conclusion that the present and the future are much more important than anything that happened previously."

That creepeth o’er ruins old!
Of right choice food are his meals, I ween,
In his cell so lone and cold.

And the mouldering dust that years have made
Is a merry meal for him.

Fast he stealeth on, though he wears no wings,
And a staunch old heart has he.

To his friend the huge Oak Tree!

And his leaves he gently waves,
As he joyously hugs and crawleth round

Creeping where grim death has been,

And nations have scattered been;
But the stout old Ivy shall never fade,
From its hale and hearty green.

Shall fatten upon the past:

The poem begins with the speaker describing the worlds that ivy enjoys the most. It thrives in places left in disrepair and mankind no longer has any interest in it. It twines itself around “crumbled” and decaying walls, and makes meals from the “dust that years have made.” He continues to intricately personify how ivy moves and consumes what's in its path. It slithers and slides like a snake while ruthlessly taking everything that it wants. In the final stanza, the speaker explains how after humankind passes away, and all the works of the world abandoned, ivy will still be there. It will never fade or die off as there is always something for it to consume."

All beautiful and splendid things,
Blue waves whitened on a cliff,

The poem begins with the speaker describing her first batch of life's experiences. She speaks of waves, fire, and the faces of children. These different parts of the human experience are equal in her mind. They all bring with them joy and beauty beyond measure. It is clear from the first stanza that the speaker places no importance on trivial matters of life. The grander emotions and activities are what she cares about most. She lists off another set of emotional moments in the second stanza. Here she addresses love, spirituality, and music. The final stanza asks that a reader always invest everything they are in finding and acquiring as many of these experiences as possible. There is no cost too high for “ecstasy.”"

In the first lines of this piece, the first speaker, a bougainvillea plant, begins by describing how spring has come and it is growing along the road. It knows it is bringing joy to all those who pass by. In the second half of the poem, a little flower pipes up, making sure it is heard over the seemingly more important beauty of the bougainvillea. The flower notes that, despite its tiny stature, is bringing joy to the world as well."

I was picking flowers, playing by my door,
When you, my lover, on a bamboo horse,
Came trotting in circles and throwing green plums.
We lived near together on a lane in Ch’ang-kan,
Both of us young and happy-hearted.
...At fourteen I became your wife,
So bashful that I dared not smile,
And I lowered my head toward a dark corner
And would not turn to your thousand calls;
But at fifteen I straightened my brows and laughed,
Learning that no dust could ever seal our love,
That even unto death I would await you by my post
And would never lose heart in the tower of silent watching.
...Then when I was sixteen, you left on a long journey
Through the Gorges of Ch’u-t’ang, of rock and whirling water.
And then came the Fifth-month, more than I could bear,
And I tried to hear the monkeys in your lofty far-off sky.
Your footprints by our door, where I had watched you go,
Were hidden, every one of them, under green moss,
Hidden under moss too deep to sweep away.
And the first autumn wind added fallen leaves.
And now, in the Eighth-month, yellowing butterflies
Hover, two by two, in our west-garden grasses
And, because of all this, my heart is breaking
And I fear for my bright cheeks, lest they fade.

Send me a message home ahead!

This poem centers on a love story. Li Bai talks about a little girl who marries a boy at fourteen. Their relationship develops from childhood days. Here, the poet details the mental workings of the girl. From her perspective, Bai depicts how she reacts when she turns fifteen. As she turns sixteen, she prepares herself for the lonely days waiting ahead of her. When her husband leaves, she becomes so lonely that everything seems meaningless to her. The poem ends on this elegiac tone, depicting a lonely girl's longing for her husband who has not returned from his journey."

Although not stated one would assume that the man the narrator is talking about is in, or was in, the armed services, possibly the RAF. 'The Manhunt' is unsurprisingly poignant. It is written in thirteen couplets. There is a vague rhyming pattern to the couplets but this is inconsistent which I think gives the poem a fragmented feel, perhaps this is to represent how their relationship has been? 'The Manhunt' contains a lot of the striking imagery that is a hallmark of Armitage's. The narrator comes across as gentle and supportive."

Firstly, the daughter, that is the poet, is surprised to realize that her mother is aging. Secondly, she notices how the rest of the world appears young and energetic. This is in contrast to her mother who continues to age. Thirdly, the poet expresses her apprehension over losing her mother if the old woman dies. Finally, the poet says how she hides her true feelings and smiles outwardly. She wishes to show her love for her mother. The poet is the confessor of feelings in this poem. She describes her feelings for her mother while traveling in a car. It is during one of her visits to her mother's place. The poet looks at her mother's face and realizes that her mother had grown old. She is disturbed by the fact that her mother may soon die of old age. She becomes emotional and tries to distract herself by looking out at the passing scenery. The poet records the contrasting nature of the scenery: there are young trees and playing children. They represent the freshness and youth of what is on earth, while her mother looks old and frail. In the final part of the poem, the poet expresses her fear of losing her mother to death. Even as a young girl, the poet had similar feelings and fears. She was so afraid of losing her mother that she would never leave her for a moment. The poet, even as a grown-up daughter, experiences a similar emotion. However, she can hide her fears. She smiles at her mother. She tries to express her love and affection to her aging mother, as the poet bids goodbye."

Throughout the poem, the speaker emphasizes the brutal nature of contemporary life and the clear fact at the heart of it–people aren't good to one another. They don't know about and don't acknowledge their own or other's loneliness. There are men and women out in the world who will do anything to feel close to another person all because the simple kindnesses in society have vanished. He runs through some of the solutions that people turn to when they find themselves lost and without the life, they wanted and tells the reader that none of these are going to help in the end. It's all about changing the way that people treat one another on the most basic level."

The speaker begins by describing her own intensely miserable state. She has lost all the strong emotions of her life, she does not feel joy nor fear at death. Charlotte has lived to see a day she did not want to see when her most cherished companion has died. This person, her sister Anne, was so important to her that she would've died to save her if she could have. She continues on to describe the last moments of Anne's life and her fervent desire that Anne's suffering comes to an end. Even though this will mean her sister is gone for good, she can't help wishing that each struggling breath would be the last. In the final two quatrains, she turns her thoughts to God. She describes the conflict within her. Her desire to curse God for what he took, and thank him for reliving her pain. She concedes to her thanks and accepts the fact that she will have to live in a world without her remaining sister."

Within the lines of 'Tonight I Can Write' the speaker describes how easy it is for him to write the “saddest poem of all”. He's in a state of mind that allows him to write moving lines, of which he gives several examples. He can write this way because he has a love affair on his mind while also worrying about his newfound loneliness. In conclusion, the speaker, who is likely the poet himself, says that this is the “last poem that” he's going to “write for her”."

That is seated by the sea;
Often in thought go up and down

And the sea-tides tossing free;
And Spanish sailors with bearded lips,
And the beauty and mystery of the ships,

The poetic persona of the poem starts with a description of the old town where once he lived. The streets of the town, tossing of the sea waves, and the woods surrounding the town, are what he sees in his imagination. He becomes a boy again and captures those memories. The poet can recall how his boyish imagination made everything gleaming during his youth. More, there are a lot of other memories that appear in this poem. Lastly, the poet talks about how his town looks like when he visits it nowadays. The freshness of the town and the gleaming leaves of the Deering wood still captivates his heart. But, the old song somehow rings through his mind. The days of youth pass away like the wind. What remains, is a half-hearted recapitulation of the memories."

He has been trapped inside of a whale and the ribs are arching over him. The waves of the ocean roll past him as the whale descends inside of the whale. The speaker can see the opening of its jaws above him and calls out to God to save him, doubting that he would be saved, but he is. God “No more the whale did me confine.” God sped to the narrator's side, as if on “a radiant dolphin” and now this song, the poem itself, will record “That terrible, joyful hour” forever.

The poem begins with the speaker describing how civilization is not the solid construct that many assume it to be. It is instead a “manifold illusion.” It is an imaginary experience had in tandem throughout human existence. The sonnet continues on to state that humankind has no true understanding of civilizations' transitory nature. One might “rage” throughout their life looking for meaning but without a true journey and full understanding of life, there will be no meaningful revelations. In the second half of the poem, the speaker moves on to briefly describe the lives of two hermits who are positioned on Mount Meru and Mount Everest. While Everest is being traversed as a physical test, the scaling of Meru is a spiritual one. The poem concludes with the speaker restating the fact that the world is always changing. Dawn will bring on the night for the rest of time until God's creation is destroyed. These are facts the hermits have come to know throughout their spiritual and physical struggles."

Lorde draws upon the semantics of movement to depict how the couple was not right for each other, journeying in different directions. The first stanza explores the moment of splitting, both leaving from the other. After this, Lorde moves the poem in the direction of exploring what comes after the breakup. The second stanza looks at how they will remember each other and the events that followed the breakup. The ending of the poem is reflective, Lorde concluding that you cannot waste your time when you know a relationship isn't right."

Housman is a poem about aging, regret, and the beauty of one's youth. In the first stanza of this poem, the speaker acknowledges that he is filled with bitter regret for the loss of his youth and the beauty it was filled with. He focuses the images on beautiful young men and young women with whom he spent his time. In the second stanza, he describes the women as sleeping and the men as laying on the ground in a field where “roses fade.” Here, he is suggesting that no matter the power of one's youth and the beauty and pleasure that a company that, these things are all doomed to fade with time."

The Farmer’s Bride was Charlotte Mew’s first poetry collection and it was printed in chapbook format by the Poetry Bookshop. The title of the poem, A Quoi Bon Dire, is in French and it can be translated as “What’s the good” or “What’s the point”. A Quoi Bon Dire has three stanzas with an ABAB rhyme scheme. The verses’ constant and stable pace suggest harmony both in the lyrical voice and in what he/she is saying. This harmony is extremely important as it goes along with the tone of the poem. The lyrical voice seems to understand the passing of time clearly and calmly while others don’t. Moreover, the sibilance in the stanzas creates a slow and calm rhythm. Thus, the poem, although talking about death and aging, introduces a positive remembrance. A Quoi Bon Dire explores the process of aging and deals with topics such as loss and death. Hence, the main theme in the poem is the effects of time and everlasting love."

Of smoke in slow suspended skeins Above their scrap of history, Only an attitude remains:

Larkin was not known for his sentimentality and indeed almost played up to his reputation as being a rather sour individual who had misgivings towards traditions and institutions to which many in the fifties and sixties still held dear. However, despite his atheist leanings and scepticism about marriage, he still took an interest in church-going and the dynamics of relationships."

Waxy stalact,"'Nick and the Candlestick' by Sylvia Plath is an original depiction of what it is like to be a new mother with a precious child to take care of. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker begins by comparing herself to a miner who is being guided by a dying flame. She's metaphorically moving around in a cave and spends time describing what it's like there. It's old and filled with minerals, water, and child air. The atmosphere is compared to both a womb and death. In the next lines, the poet addresses her child, asking him how he came to find himself in this place. He is the gem that she's been searching for and she tries to reassure him about the world he's being born into. The speaker describes her son as the only real anchor point in her life. Everything in her world is centered around this new child."

The speaker directly asks the reader four different and oddly unrelated seeming (at least at first) questions. These touch on the nature of flowers, trees, and their roots, “thieving” cars, and whether a train in the rain is sad or not. All of these questions talk around the ways that we perceive truth, beauty, and one state of being or the next."

'The Heat of Autumn' by Jane Hirshfield introduces the theme of the poem that is the difference between the “heat of autumn” and the “heat of summer” in the first two lines of the poem. The poet says, the summer-heat ripens the apples whereas the autumnal heat transforms them into “cider”. Cider is a type of apple juice that is generally made from the early apples of the summer season. Thereafter the poet talks about the possibilities of the summer season. While autumn is according to the poet like the shivering “spine of a thin swimming horse” in the cold water of a river. In the upcoming lines, the poet presents a simple story of a husband suffering from cancer and his wife. The man deserts his wife for his lover. But the wife remains constant in her duties towards the husband. Her love is like the heat of autumn that fades away in the winter."

Singing an ecstasy I could not share,
Played cunning in my thoughts. Surely in these
Pleasures there could not be a pain to bear

For under all the gentleness there came
An earthquake tremor: Fountain, birds and grass

Readers can connect with this poem ‘Absence’ because most people have lost someone they love either to death or to falling out or the end of a relationship. When someone disappears, part of the shock is that other things stay the same. In ‘Absence’, the speaker talks about going to a place where she last was when she met the person about whom the poem is written. She is disturbed by the lack of change that has taken place. While everything inside of her had changed, it seemed that nothing on the outside had changed. The speaker eloquently describes the way the lack of change in the scenery affected her."

Despite these things, he does take some comfort in knowing that she's safe in heaven now. She was baptized and both he and his wife like to consider her in the arms of Mary Magdalene.

She expands the notion to include all “wom[e]n” by addressing “a nun” who has no husband or “child,” but the narration soon shifts back to how “tired” the narrator is from “always hold[ing] something.” This dissatisfaction seems to be the theme of ‘A Woman’s Hands’, and when considered with the idea that she feels “own[ed],” this poem could be a statement of allowing yourself to be happy. Had this relationship been more akin to what the “woman” was looking for, she may not have grudged it so. In this, Bezwoda warns the married to be sensitive to the needs of the other party rather than insisting on a situation where one “always” gives and the other “always” takes. That kind of imbalance, after all, can lead to a ruined relationship."

He prays to God when his body returns to nature it must be turned into a sprout. The sprout will come out from his eyes and fruits will dangle from its branches in the future. His lips which once moved while singing will now be part of the ground. People will dance on it. He might also get transformed into a rose which maidens like. When he becomes a tree, birds will gather around him. Lastly, the poet says after his death one can hear the sound of the sea in his heart."

The poem begins with the speaker comparing her skin to a body bag that will last for now. This speaks to the temporality of life itself, something emphasized to a great extent during wartime. The speaker's observations in her living room, while watching TV change her whole perspective on life. Her relationships become more complicated and are compared to military tactics of used by pilots observing and tracking enemies. She feels tracked by these fighter pilots, utilizing radar systems and pinpoint accurate missiles. All these experiences come together through fractured lines that are scattered with references to military terms and lines from a 1960s phrase book. Shapcott's interpretation of this time period is not cohesive or completely clear. It is emotionally charged and speaks on the difficultly of understanding and maintaining human relationships during a fragmented time. Her language breaks apart, just like the world."

Someday they would come and take them with them. What the speaker believes is that he belongs to his own family.

to where the crusty grouper, onyx-eyed,

This collection of poems stretches the poet’s sense of disillusionment beyond his immediate origin. By taking help from the histories of other suffering nations, Walcott describes the condition of his own people. In this poem, he makes an experiment with the verse pattern and borrows the structure of terza rima from Dante’s ‘Divine Comedy.’ The poem also echoes Shelley’s ‘Ode to the West Wind.’

Walcott admits that, more or less, all the African writers of his generation were natural assimilators as they were quite well-versed in Greek, Roman, and English literature through their essential classes. In this poem, there were frequent references to the Bible when Walcott compares the journey of the African slaves transported to the Caribbean shores under the colonial rule of the flight of the Jews in the Old Testament seeking the Promised Land."

The lyrical voice notices the plant and makes a careful depiction of it and its surroundings. In the first lines, the lyrical voice describes the features and details of the plant. Moreover, later in the poem, the plant is related to a more comprehensive look of the world. This link with a more general sphere is made through the mention of the “Sister Mary”, which enables a meditation on different human actions and their relation to the plant. "

Afar beyond the stars,
Where stands a winged sentry
All skillful in the wars;
There, above noise and danger

And One born in a manger
Commands the beauteous files.
He is thy gracious friend

Did in pure love descend,
To die here for thy sake.

There grows the flow’r of peace,
The rose that cannot wither,

But One, who never changes,
Thy God, thy life, thy cure.","My Soul, there is a country Afar beyond the stars, Where stands a win","Peace' by Henry Vaughan is a simple and uplifting poem about the world of Heaven and what waits for humankind there. Throughout this poem, the speaker describes the nature of Heaven. It is a place without danger or sadness, filled only with the peace and happiness of God. There, humanity will find God, the angels, and Christ who commands them. In the final lines of the poem, the speaker asks his soul to refrain from focusing on anything that doesn't contribute to his faithful worship of God and his path to Heaven."
1405,1416,1416,"Tomorrow, when the latest Deathometer of Covid is announced
in sonorous tones,
Whilst all the bodies still mount and curl towards the middle of the curve
Heaped one atop and alongside the other
My sister will be among those numbers, among the throwaway lines
Among the platitudes and lowered eyes,
an older person with underlying health conditions,
A pitiful way to lay rest the bare bones of a life.

My sister is not a statistic 

Her underlying conditions were
Love
Kindness
Belief in the essential goodness of mankind
Uproarious laughter
Forgiveness
Compassion
A storyteller
A survivor
A comforter
A force of nature
And so much more

My sister is not a statistic 

She died without the soft touch of a loved one’s hand
Without the feathered kiss upon her forehead
Without the muted murmur of familiar family voices gathered around her bed,
Without the gentle roar of laughter that comes with memories recalled
Evoked from a time that already seems distant, when we were connected by the simplicity
of touch, of voice, of presence.

My sister is not a statistic 

She was a woman who spanned the seven ages.
A mother
A grandmother
A great grandmother
A sister
A Friend
An aunt
A carer
A giver

My sister is not a statistic

And so, she joins the mounting thousands

They are not statistics on the Deathometer of Covid

They are the wives, mothers, children, fathers, sisters, brothers,
The layers of all our loved ones
If she could, believe me when I say, she would hold every last one of your loved ones, croon
to and comfort them and say – you were loved.
Whilst we who have been left behind mourn deep, keening the loss, the injustice, the rage.
One day we will smile and laugh again, we will remember with joy that, once, we shared a
life, we knew joy and survived sadness.

You are my sister…….. and I love you.",My sister is not a statistic She was a woman who spanned the seven,"'My Sister is Not a Statistic' by Dorothy Duffy is an emotional poem that depicts the poet's feelings after her sister's death. After her sister Rose passed on, Dorothy Duffy wrote this poem as a way to collect her emotions and express her opinion on the treatment of COVID-19 victims. The lines express her love for her sister as well as all the things she was to her and to others in her life. She was far more than another statistic for the news media to report on. She was a mother, sister, aunt, grandmother, and great grandmother. These are the things, in addition to her kindness and laughter, that the poet hopes her sister will be remembered for."

That cool’st the twilight of the sultry day,
Gratefully flows thy freshness round my brow:
Thou hast been out upon the deep at play,
Riding all day the wild blue waves till now,
Roughening their crests, and scattering high their spray
And swelling the white sail. I welcome thee
To the scorched land, thou wanderer of the sea!
Nor I alone—a thousand blossoms round
Inhale thee in the fulness of delight;
And languid forms rise up, and pulses bound
Livelier, at coming of the wind of night;
And, languishing to hear thy grateful sound,
Lies the vast inland stretched beyond the sight.
Go forth into the gathering shade; go forth,
God’s blessing breathed upon the fainting earth!
Go, rock the little wood-bird in his nest,
Curl the still waters, bright with stars, and rouse
The wide old wood from his majestic rest,
Summoning from the innumerable boughs
The strange, deep harmonies that haunt his breast:
Pleasant shall be thy way where meekly bows.
The shutting flower, and darkling waters pass,
And where the o’ershadowing branches sweep the grass.
The faint old man shall lean his silver head
To feel thee; thou shalt kiss the child asleep,
And dry the moistened curls that overspread
His temples, while his breathing grows more deep:
And they who stand about the sick man’s bed,
Shall joy to listen to thy distant sweep,
And softly part his curtains to allow
Thy visit, grateful to his burning brow.
Go—but the circle of eternal change,
Which is the life of nature, shall restore,
With sounds and scents from all thy mighty range
Thee to thy birthplace of the deep once more;
Sweet odours in the sea-air, sweet and strange,
Shall tell the home-sick mariner of the shore;
And, listening to thy murmur, he shall deem
He hears the rustling leaf and running stream.","The spirit that breathest through my lattice, thou that cool’s","'The Evening Wind' by William Cullen Bryant describes the impact that the evening wind has on varying parts of the earth, human and non-human alike. The poem begins with the speaker relishing in the coming of the evening wind to his home. It has been a “sultry” day that is lightened with the coolness of the breeze. The speaker describes how the wind has spent its day in the next line. It has moved the waters of the ocean for hours, “scattering high their spray,” but now it has come inland. In the following stanzas, the speaker tells the reader about all the wind is going to do. From his house, it will “Go” and touch the lives of “mariners,” birds, sick men, and mourners alike. All manner of creatures will benefit from the peace of the “evening wind.”"

The poem begins with the speaker exclaiming over the state of a room. First, he describes the clothes that are hanging in places they definitely don't belong. There is a wet raincoat on a cloth chair and underwear on a lamp. The next lines speak of misplaced books and papers, more clothes, and even a ski under the TV. The lines progress in a list-like fashion, building off one another until the reader has a clear picture of what the room contains, By the end, one should feel revulsion on a level equal to the speaker's. This makes the twist at the end all the more satisfying as the room is revealed to have been the speaker's all along."
1408,1419,1419,"In Singapore, in the airport,
A darkness was ripped from my eyes.
In the women’s restroom, one compartment stood open.
A woman knelt there, washing something in the white bowl.

Disgust argued in my stomach
and I felt, in my pocket, for my ticket.

A poem should always have birds in it.
Kingfishers, say, with their bold eyes and gaudy wings.
Rivers are pleasant, and of course trees.
A waterfall, or if that’s not possible, a fountain rising and falling.
A person wants to stand in a happy place, in a poem.

When the woman turned I could not answer her face.
Her beauty and her embarrassment struggled together,
and neither could win.
She smiled and I smiled. What kind of nonsense is this?
Everybody needs a job.

Yes, a person wants to stand in a happy place, in a poem.
But first we must watch her as she stares down at her labor,
which is dull enough.
She is washing the tops of the airport ashtrays, as big as hubcaps,
with a blue rag.
Her small hands turn the metal, scrubbing and rinsing.
She does not work slowly, nor quickly, like a river.
Her dark hair is like the wing of a bird.

I don’t doubt for a moment that she loves her life.
And I want her to rise up from the crust and the slop and
fly down to the river.
This probably won’t happen.
But maybe it will.
If the world were only pain and logic, who would want it?

Of course, it isn’t.
Neither do I mean anything miraculous, but only
the light that can shine out of a life. I mean
the way she unfolded and refolded the blue cloth,
The way her smile was only for my sake; I mean
the way this poem is filled with trees, and birds."," A woman wants to stand in a happy place, in a poem.</s","'Singapore' by Mary Oliver is a thoughtful poem about beauty, poetry, and what makes a happy life. The poem opens in an airport restroom in Singapore. When the speaker walks into the restroom, she notices a beautiful woman standing in one of the bathroom stalls washing something in the white bowl. The speaker admits that she was disgusted by this discovery and immediately suggests that what she saw that day is not appropriate material for the subject of a poem. As most of Oliver's poems do, she says that a poem should “have birds in it.” There should be natural elements like trees, rivers, a waterfall, etc. The woman turns around and smiles at the speaker, who smiles back. Here, she begins to consider how ridiculous her prior disgust over the situation has been. The world is not perfect, as some poems are. All people, like this woman, have to work. She's staring down at “her labor” in the bowl and washing “the tops of the airport ashtrays.” She's scrubbing quickly and steadily. The speaker knows that the woman loves her life despite the uncomfortable situation. She is inspired to imagine that same woman rising from her life and flying down to the river, as though she's one of the birds in Oliver's other poems. The speaker concludes the poem by suggesting that the same happy, peaceful feelings captured in nature poetry are also present in this one."

The ship went on with solemn face;
To meet the darkness on the deep,
The solemn ship went onward:
I bowed down weary in the place,
For parting tears and present sleep
Had weighed mine eyelids downward.

II

Thick sleep which shut all dreams from me,
And kept my inner self apart
And quiet from emotion,
Then brake away and left me free,
Made conscious of a human heart
Betwixt the heaven and ocean.

III

The new sight, the new wondrous sight!
The waters round me, turbulent,
The skies impassive o'er me,
Calm in a moonless, sunless light,
Half glorified by that intent
Of holding the day-glory!

IV

Two pale thin clouds did stand upon
The meeting line of sea and sky,
With aspect still and mystic:
I think they did foresee the sun,
And rested on their prophecy
In quietude majestic,

V

Then flushed to radiance where they stood,
Like statues by the open tomb
Of shining saints half risen.
The sun! — he came up to be viewed,
And sky and sea made mighty room
To inaugurate the vision.

VI

I oft had seen the dawnlight run
As red wine through the hills, and break
Through many a mist's inurning;
But, here, no earth profaned the sun:
Heaven, ocean, did alone partake
The sacrament of morning.

VII

Away with thoughts fantastical!
I would be humble to my worth,
Self-guarded as self-doubted:
Though here no earthly shadows fall,
I, joying, grieving without earth,
May desecrate without it.

VIII

God's sabbath morning sweeps the waves;
I would not praise the pageant high
Yet miss the dedicature:
I, carried toward the sunless graves
By force of natural things, — should I
Exult in only Nature?

IX

And could I bear to sit alone
'Mid Nature's fixed benignities,
While my warm pulse was moving?
Too dark thou art, O glittering sun,
Too strait ye are, capacious seas,
To satisfy the loving!

X

It seems a better lot than so,
To sit with friends beneath the beech,
And feel them dear and dearer;
Or follow children as they go
In pretty pairs, with softened speech,
As the church-bells ring nearer.

XI

Love me, sweet friends, this sabbath day!
The sea sings round me while ye roll
Afar the hymn unaltered,
And kneel, where once I knelt to pray,
And bless me deeper in the soul,
Because the voice has faltered.

XII

And though this sabbath comes to me
Without the stoled minister
Or chanting congregation,
God's Spirit brings communion, H E
Who brooded soft on waters drear,
Creator on creation.

XIII

Himself, I think, shall draw me higher
Where keep the saints with harp and song
An endless sabbath morning,
And on that sea commixed with fire
Oft drop their eyelids, raised too long
To the full Godhead's burning.","The ship went on with solemn face; To meet the darkness on the deep, The","'Sabbath Morning at Sea' by Elizabeth Barrett Browning describes the experiences of a speaker trapped on board a ship at sea. The poem begins with the speaker stating that she is on a “solemn ship” which is sailing into the deep blackness of the sea. She has no way off the craft and is despairing over the coming of the sabbath. Rather than mourn the fact that she isn't with her “sweet friends” and the “stolèd minister” she glorifies the world around her. The speaker tries to find something beautiful in the turning sea and emotionless sky. In the final section, the speaker devotes her words to God. She describes for her intended listeners that God will get her through these days. He will allow her to raise herself above her present situation and commune with the saints in Heaven."

of coca cola bottles sweating rings
on veneered tabletops and the steel drone

as burning hair. One is small, fine toothed

the curve of her neck as she leaned over
the stove, her eyes shut as she pulled

sweat glistening above her lips,

In the first lines, the speaker begins by describing the setting and the broader atmosphere in her home. She's looking through drawers in a dark room and comes upon hot combs that her mother used to use. She can remember how they looked in her hands as she fixed her hair. The images of her mother's neck, eyes, and hair are clearly and emotionally conveyed. They are followed by an allusion to the mother's suffering, an emotional state that made her even more beautiful."

'The Duck' by Ogden Nash is a poem about the duck. The main concerns of the poet in this poem are the sound made by the duck, its habitat, and at the end, how it “sups”. In the beginning, the poet tells readers to “behold the duck”. It is a reference to consider the duck and its behaviors. The poet says it can't “cluck” or make a short, low sound with its tongue to express concern or disapproval like human beings. The duck can only quack. Thereafter, in the second section of the poem, the poet refers to its habitats and where it can be easily found. And, at the last two lines, the poet implies an irony and refers to its dining and drinking style. The duck generally eats or drinks something while raiding its bottom upwards."

Browning begins the poem with a laudatory remark. His poetic persona tries to glorify the lady's face that he is seeing. The face is painted upon a pale gold background, hinting at how old the painting is. No matter how old it is, one can still notice the beautiful lips, neck, and cheeks of the lady, complementing the overall appeal of that image. The speaker describes how her lips are shown in a manner that they are waiting to be kissed. Furthermore, her neck is so sensitive that it appears to the speaker as if it could shiver upon laying his fingers upon it. Then he goes on to compare the image with famous Italian painter Correggio's paintings. Finally, he ponders upon the mortality of youth and beauty with reference to the fading pale background of the portrait."

He also speaks about the winds in heaven and how they move and mix like the water but with even more beautiful emotional poignancy. Shelley emphasizes the importance of understanding interconnectivity and the fact that the world is connected bit by bit through spirit. He uses this as an argument to address “you,” the person he loves. He believes that since they are already connected that they should come together as lovers. The poem concludes with the speaker describing the mountains, heaven, and the embrace of the waves. He thinks it would be a shame if she did not accept his physical love. Without her, all the beautiful connections in the world seem worthless."

He'd be able to save some of his youth if he'd only have children. In order to drive his point home, the speaker tells the youth how irresponsible he's being.

Are those we love the best.

Can rouse your wrath, tis true;
Annoyance in your heart will rise
At things mere strangers do;

Are oft to strangers shown;
The careless mien, the frowning face,
Are given to our own.
We flatter those we scarcely know,
We please the fleeting guest,
And deal many a thoughtless blow
To those we love the best.

Nor true hearts yearly bloom.

The poem explains to the reader, from the speaker's own experience, that the only real pain one goes through in life comes from those we love. The rest is forgotten, written off as small annoyances, and passes before it does any damage. She also spends time chastising herself, the reader, and all others, for the times in which we cared more for the opinions of strangers than maintaining the love of our family members and closest companions."

The speaker begins this piece by describing the position that a man holds in her mind. This person, who does not end up being the main focus of the piece, is like a “god” to the speaker. He is “more than a hero” as it is he who is allowed to “sit beside you.” The “you” to whom the speaker refers is a woman she is in love with but cannot have. The speaker is tormented by the sight of the intended listener of this piece sitting and speaking intimately with her lover. In the following sections of the poem, the speaker goes through all the emotions she experiences in her everyday life as she thinks, sees, and tries to speak with this woman. Her words are often jumbled, her vision blurred, and her ears clogged with the sound of her own heartbeat. She is unable to control her own body and is all of a sudden shaking and covered in sweat. The poem concludes abruptly with the speaker describing how her emotions are so strong it feels as if she is often close to death."

I'm from Artemus and Billie's Branch,
fried corn and strong coffee.
From the finger my grandfather lost
to the auger,
the eye my father shut to keep his sight.

a sift of lost faces
to drift beneath my dreams.
I am from those moments--
snapped before I budded --
leaf-fall from the family tree.","I am from clothespins, from Clorox and carbon-tetrachloride","'Where I'm From' by George Ella Lyon is a powerful poem that is rooted in the most memorable images of the poet's own youth. The text takes the reader through a series of pictures from the poet's childhood. These are things she remembers experiencing and from which she feels she comes. They defined who she was as a child and who she is today. She speaks of the work she did alongside her family, her friends, their sayings, and the joys of being around those she loved. There are references to religion, small joys and losses, and then finally to the larger family tree that bore her into the world."

The speaker begins the poem by claiming that she has died already, more than once, and that she will keep on dying. As one reads the lines of this poem, the lesson becomes clear. The speaker describes death and pain in such vivid detail that the readers can sympathize with her. Then, she explains her reason for continuing to live through all the pain that she has endured. At the end of the poem, the reader can remember the title and conclude that The Lesson is to embrace life, even at its most bitter moments, and to press on through the hard times to make an opportunity for the good times.

The poem is only six lines long, but through those lines, the poet depicts how poetic inspiration blunders through the woods of his mind, climbing over boulders, and arrives at his fireside. There, it's too shy to step into the light. He has to get up and walk to the edge of the darkness in order to understand it. The poem is rich in symbolism and requires a bit of analysis and interpretation on the reader's part to understand how it connects to writing poetry."

That work is Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, which extends into Through the Looking Glass, and this poem stands as a tribute to the original work itself as well as the readers of that work. Both author and reader are united in this “Wonderland” “dream,” and while Carroll has unpleasant feelings regarding the “[l]ingering” nature of “Alice,” the readers’ perspectives are the surrounding elements of focus. This is the ultimate tip of the hat from Carroll to readers, and it is presented in a pure “Wonderland” fashion."

Sanchez uses her command of melody and rhythm to evoke color and imagery that is distinct to her connections to blues, as well as her indigenous heritage as she experiences it. She seems to question her place in this collective history, searching and experimenting with movement, song, and dance as a way to tap into a deeper state of understanding."

Although they grow up in different places, speak different languages, use different money, and have different cultures, Wells suggests that they are perfect for each other. The idea of fate, with it being fate that they will one day meet, is an iconic trope of love poetry – with the idea of star-crossed lovers being famous from all avenues of literature. The poem could be understood as somewhat critical, or mocking, this trope, with the final line of the poem perhaps moving towards tropes of Hollywood in order to suggest that fated love is only something from movies.

1425,1436,1436,"The old South Boston Aquarium stands
in a Sahara of snow now. Its broken windows are boarded.
The bronze weathervane cod has lost half its scales.
The airy tanks are dry.

Once my nose crawled like a snail on the glass;
my hand tingled
to burst the bubbles
drifting from the noses of the cowed, compliant fish.

My hand draws back. I often sigh still
for the dark downward and vegetating kingdom
of the fish and reptile. One morning last March,
I pressed against the new barbed and galvanized

fence on the Boston Common. Behind their cage,
yellow dinosaur steamshovels were grunting
as they cropped up tons of mush and grass
to gouge their underworld garage.

Parking spaces luxuriate like civic
sandpiles in the heart of Boston.
A girdle of orange, Puritan-pumpkin colored girders
braces the tingling Statehouse,

shaking over the excavations, as it faces Colonel Shaw
and his bell-cheeked Negro infantry
on St. Gaudens' shaking Civil War relief,
propped by a plank splint against the garage's earthquake.

Two months after marching through Boston,
half the regiment was dead;
at the dedication,
William James could almost hear the bronze Negroes breathe.
 
Their monument sticks like a fishbone
in the city's throat.
Its Colonel is as lean
as a compass-needle.

He has an angry wrenlike vigilance,
a greyhound's gentle tautness;
he seems to wince at pleasure,
and suffocate for privacy.

He is out of bounds now. He rejoices in man's lovely,
peculiar power to choose life and die—
when he leads his black soldiers to death,
he cannot bend his back.

On a thousand small town New England greens,
the old white churches hold their air
of sparse, sincere rebellion; frayed flags
quilt the graveyards of the Grand Army of the Republic.

The stone statues of the abstract Union Soldier
grow slimmer and younger each year—
wasp-waisted, they doze over muskets
and muse through their sideburns . . .

Shaw's father wanted no monument
except the ditch,
where his son's body was thrown
and lost with his ""niggers.""

The ditch is nearer.

shows Hiroshima boiling

over a Mosler Safe, the ""Rock of Ages""

His fear and suffering concerning the society he lived are paralleled by his comparison of the past with the present. 'For the Union Dead', narrated by a first-person speaker, starts with Lowell's reminiscence of his childhood memory of the Boston Aquarium. It commemorates the sacrifice of Colonel Robert Shaw, a Union officer killed while leading a regiment of black troops during the Civil War. Lowell connects his childhood and a Civil War memorial to contemporary life, including progress and civil rights. He laments the erosion of heroic idealism and increasing self-interest and greed in contemporary American society, contrasting the historic past and present. He deliberates on missing idealism as being dead among the people of America of 1963 and in the modern culture in general."

The poem begins with the speaker making the bold statement that “A child's face is a drowned face”. He immediately explains what he means by this unnerving statement. The speaker compares the gulf between what a parent sees and what a child understands, and visa versa, to the sea. There is something massive and impenetrable between parents and their children. They can't get through it, nor can the child communicate clearly from within it."

The poem begins with the speaker describing a situation in which his “friend calls” to him “from the road.” This person has come on their horse in order to tell him something, or perhaps just to chat. Neither the reader nor the speaker are aware of what the friend has to say. This is not an important part of the narrative. Of greater interest to Frost is the speaker's choice to set aside his “hoe,” disregard the fields he has yet to work and go speak to his friend. The speaker tells the reader what they should do by informing them of what they shouldn't do. One should not “stand still and look around” then resort to shouting down the hill. This is not how one treats someone they care about. It does not matter how tired one is or what work is left to do, a good friend “plod[s]” down and has a “friendly visit.”"

The poem uses the same word, “Because,” at the beginning of each line. They all relate to why she decided that she wanted to paint her nails. She wanted to surprise her lover, bother her daughter, make herself proud of her hands, give herself to look at in traffic, and distract herself from life. The most important reason seems to be that it gives her control over a reversible element of her appearance."

You","In 'Mother, Any Distance', the narrator asks his mother to come and help him measure his new house; it is suspected that he might be moving house soon, and so needs his mother to help him measure for wallpaper, carpeting, and so on. Structurally, it is written freehand, in fifteen lines of unequal lines and rhyme scheme. One can argue that it is probably a sonnet, just with an additional line; an act that makes us focus specifically on the extra line. There is an unfocused, almost dazed way of writing this poem; it reads a little bit like a song, a moment of thinking between the poet's heart and his mind, a moment of reflection that pulls on throughout the rest of the poem. It's interesting to note that the focus here is specifically on actions, on brevity, on little moments that are eventually lost to time."

Or Angelina blooms.

Forestalling Time's slow-moving scythe,
And, scattered on thy little field,
Disjointed bards may writhe.

To bind thee up among its sheaves;

To gild its leaden leaves.

Till distant shores shall hear the sound;

Fresh life on all around.

Around the humblest name.

The poem introspects on the future of a blank sheet of paper. The poetic persona is trying to write a poem or a tale on paper. According to him, none can tell on which theme the poet is going to write. The poet can write a love lyric or an elegy that can make one sad. He may write a satirical piece or a horror story. Moreover, the writing can vary according to the poet's mood. However, at last, the poet expresses the significance of the blank paper. The poet says it can bring fame but it's temporary."

And mountains of wearisome height;

There will be those who are happy and hopeful and those who are suffering a great deal. He won't judge them; he says (as he knows he's guilty of making mistakes too).

Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,

Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.",I wandered lonely as a cloud That floats on high o'er,"The speaker, likely William Wordsworth himself, is wandering down the hills and valley when he stumbled upon a beautiful field of daffodils. The speaker is transfixed by the daffodils seemingly waving, fluttering, and dancing along the waterside. Albeit, the lake’s waves moved as fervently, but the beauty of daffodils outdid with flying colors. The poet feels immensely gleeful and chirpy at this mesmerizing natural sight. Amongst the company of flowers, he remains transfixed at those daffodils wavering with full vigor. Oblivious to the poet is the fact that this wondrous scenery of daffodils brings the poet immense blithe and joy when he’s in a tense mood or perplexed for that matter. His heart breaths a new life and gives him exponential happiness at sight worth a thousand words."

1435,1446,1446,"I had a dream, which was not all a dream.
The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars
Did wander darkling in the eternal space,
Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth
Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;
Morn came and went—and came, and brought no day,
And men forgot their passions in the dread
Of this their desolation; and all hearts
Were chill'd into a selfish prayer for light:
And they did live by watchfires—and the thrones,
The palaces of crowned kings—the huts,
The habitations of all things which dwell,
Were burnt for beacons; cities were consum'd,
And men were gather'd round their blazing homes
To look once more into each other's face;
Happy were those who dwelt within the eye
Of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch:
A fearful hope was all the world contain'd;
Forests were set on fire—but hour by hour
They fell and faded—and the crackling trunks
Extinguish'd with a crash—and all was black.
The brows of men by the despairing light
Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits
The flashes fell upon them; some lay down
And hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest
Their chins upon their clenched hands, and smil'd;
And others hurried to and fro, and fed
Their funeral piles with fuel, and look'd up
With mad disquietude on the dull sky,
The pall of a past world; and then again
With curses cast them down upon the dust,
And gnash'd their teeth and howl'd: the wild birds shriek'd
And, terrified, did flutter on the ground,
And flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes
Came tame and tremulous; and vipers crawl'd
And twin'd themselves among the multitude,
Hissing, but stingless—they were slain for food.
And War, which for a moment was no more,
Did glut himself again: a meal was bought
With blood, and each sate sullenly apart
Gorging himself in gloom: no love was left;
All earth was but one thought—and that was death
Immediate and inglorious; and the pang
Of famine fed upon all entrails—men
Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh;
The meagre by the meagre were devour'd,
Even dogs assail'd their masters, all save one,
And he was faithful to a corse, and kept
The birds and beasts and famish'd men at bay,
Till hunger clung them, or the dropping dead
Lur'd their lank jaws; himself sought out no food,
But with a piteous and perpetual moan,
And a quick desolate cry, licking the hand
Which answer'd not with a caress—he died.
The crowd was famish'd by degrees; but two
Of an enormous city did survive,
And they were enemies: they met beside
The dying embers of an altar-place
Where had been heap'd a mass of holy things
For an unholy usage; they rak'd up,
And shivering scrap'd with their cold skeleton hands
The feeble ashes, and their feeble breath
Blew for a little life, and made a flame
Which was a mockery; then they lifted up
Their eyes as it grew lighter, and beheld
Each other's aspects—saw, and shriek'd, and died—
Even of their mutual hideousness they died,
Unknowing who he was upon whose brow
Famine had written Fiend. The world was void,
The populous and the powerful was a lump,
Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless—
A lump of death—a chaos of hard clay.
The rivers, lakes and ocean all stood still,
And nothing stirr'd within their silent depths;
Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea,
And their masts fell down piecemeal: as they dropp'd
They slept on the abyss without a surge—
The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,
The moon, their mistress, had expir'd before;
The winds were wither'd in the stagnant air,
And the clouds perish'd; Darkness had no need
Of aid from them—She was the Universe."," I had a dream, which was not all a dream.</s","'Darkness' by Lord Byron serves as a warning against the growing inequality in Byron's time and a prediction for what will happen to the planet if the human race does not change. This piece begins with a description of the sun, stars, and moon being extinguished and the earth being left to stumble through space without direction. All of the people of the earth have been doomed to live in darkness. They burn everything around them, from palaces to huts and eventually religious materials. They are desperate for any kind of light to see by. All are made equal by this darkness, kings are brought to the level of peasants and all suffer together. The men burn the forests and weep as they go out. Some are driven mad by the eventual starvation they will, and do, face. The beasts of the forest become tame but are slaughtered by the men and all “sate” themselves for what will be one of the last times. Many men die from starvation until all the world is reduced to two men that become enemies. These men find themselves at the same “altar-place” amongst the ashes of religious items. They manage to start a small fire and are horrified to see one another, dying right thereof fright. The human race is now extinct, as are herbs, animals, and all plants. All water is still and the tides no longer go in or out because the moon is long since “extinguish'd.” The clouds are gone, useless to the darkness which is now “…the Universe.”"

In the awfullest way you ever saw—
And, oh! how the gingham and calico flew!
(Don't fancy I exaggerate—
I got my news from the Chinese plate!)
Next morning, where the two had sat
They found no trace of dog or cat;
And some folks think unto this day
That burglars stole that pair away!
But the truth about the cat and pup
Is this: they ate each other up!
Now what do you really think of that!
(The old Dutch clock it told me so,
And that is how I came to know.)","The gingham dog and the calico cat sat on the table, '","'The Duel' by Eugene Field is a humorous poem about the violent fight that occurred at one midnight between the gingham dog and the calico cat. The narrator of the poem has not personally seen the cat and dog fight. He narrates what he learned from the old Dutch clock and the Chinese plate, which were there in the room that night, where the duel took place. It happened between the gingham dog and the calico cat, who sat at the midnight hour side by side on the table. Suddenly, with utter violence, the dog went, “Bow-wow-wow,” with all its might and the cat went, “Mee-ow.” Latching onto each other, with their fierce teeth and claws, they ate up each other. People made up a different story of the absurd incident that actually took place that night. If the Dutch clock and the Chinese plate were not there, the narrator and readers would never know about the outcome of the tense cat-and-mouse fight."

Eliot introduces this piece with a call to action, encouraging the reader to take the time to break down their days into pieces and carefully consider whether they did something to help someone else. If the reader has helped another, even with a smile or small action, then that day can be considered well spent. The second stanza considers the other option in which one has ignored all of the changes they've had to help someone else and only considered their own wellbeing throughout the day. This person, even though it would have cost them nothing, refused to give an inch to someone else. If this is the case, then not only is this day lost, it is worse than lost. The impact of this kind of person has not been neutral, but actually negative. They have, through their lack of empathy, made the world a worse place than it was the day before. Eliot composed this piece as a simple way to encourage others to consider the times in which one has an opportunity to help and does nothing when even the smallest gesture would have been beneficial to someone in need."

Throughout the fourteen lines of 'Sonnet 110,' the speaker describes how he is back from his brief period of infidelity. He was untrue to his true love, the Fair Youth, for a time, but now he's realized that he doesn't care about anyone else but this young man. He's made several mistakes but is ready to change. The speaker says that he knows now that their love is never going to “end.” It is the only kind of relationship he wants. The poem concludes with the speaker asking that his lover accept him back because he is as close to heaven as the speaker will get."
1439,1450,1450,"HE’D have given me rolling lands,
Houses of marble, and billowing farms,
Pearls, to trickle between my hands,
Smoldering rubies, to circle my arms.
You––you’d only a lilting song,
Only a melody, happy and high,
You were sudden and swift and strong,––
Never a thought for another had I.
He’d have given me laces rare,
Dresses that glimmered with frosty sheen,
Shining ribbons to wrap my hair,
Horses to draw me, as fine as a queen.
You––you’d only to whistle low,
Gaily I followed wherever you led.
I took you, and I let him go,––
Somebody ought to examine my head!","HE’D have given me rolling lands, Houses of marble, and billowing","With the opening lines of the poem, which you can read in full here, the speaker remembers a man she could have had, and she reveals that he would have certainly given her a huge, expensive home sitting upon acres and acres of “rolling lands”. She imagines the extravagant jewellery she might have worn. In these lines, the reader can begin to feel a sense of loss. The speaker clearly has been thinking about what might have been, and it gives the audience a feeling tinged with regret. Lines 5-8 With these four lines, the speaker shifts from a feeling of regret for a possible past occurrence, to one of nostalgia and reminiscence of her actual past. While the first four lines refer to a man in third person as “he”, the next lines are written in second person, and are clearly comparing the two men. With line five, this poem begins to sound like a love sonnet. She recalls the why he (the man to whom she speaks) would sing “a melody happy and high” and she remembers how he was “sudden and swift and strong”. Then, she claims that she “never [had] a thought for another”. With this line, it seems that the speaker has given up riches and fame for true love. Lines 9-12 At this point, the speaker shifts back to the first man she mentioned, and continues to expound upon all that he would have given to her, had she married him instead. She describes the “laces” and the gorgeous “shimmering” gowns, and the “shining ribbons” and the carriages in which she would ride “fine as a queen.” At this point in the poem, the readers begin to feel the rhythm and pattern of the poem, and naturally assume that the speaker will again turn back to her true lover, the one to whom she writes this poem, and profess her love for him. For this reason, the next few lines are not only ironic, but also humorous. Lines 13-16 The first three lines of this section fit the pattern of the rest of the poem. The readers can see that the light personality of the man to whom she writes caused her to follow him wherever he went, letting go of the other rich man who wanted her. The final line of The Choice is so humorous because it is completely unexpected. Throughout the poem, the readers expect that the speaker feels she made the right choice in picking the man she fell in love with over the man who could have given her riches. But this is not how the speaker feels, and she reveals this only in the last line. Looking back, she cannot understand why she gave up all the riches that could have been within her grasp. She assumes that she was not thinking clearly, and that is why this poem ends with one shocking line, “someone ought to examine my head!” When the reader remembers that this poem is written to the man she chose, it becomes even more humorous."

The poem starts out with the speaker, an accompanist, addressing another accompanist. The speaker is explaining the way that someone has to dull their music down and pay attention to the cues that “she” gives. It's important to remember that you're an accompanist, the speaker says, and not part of a duet. As the poem progresses, the speaker also acknowledges the sexuality that can sometimes feel present within jazz music. This is something that many people will call out but which rarely exists. This is especially true in the accompanist/singer relationship as it is “partly sexual” rather than “wholly.” The poem ends with the speaker noting what music can, in the best of time, accomplish."

The speaker takes the reader into an image-rich world that depicts sleep, or as it soon becomes clear, death, like a dark forest into which one must enter when their path terminates. Despite the best efforts of many throughout time, there is no way around stepping into that forest, obeying the silence as the speaker suggests in the last stanza, and losing oneself."

He does not shy away from the darkness they've walked about of but uses it as a reason why their future is so bright. THey've suffered for centuries, and it's this suffering that's given the men and women in the African American community the strength to forge a true path towards freedom. Johnson's speaker also thanks God for giving them that strength and asks that they remain at God's side and standing in the country they've lived and died in forever."

Their unhappiness is contrasted against the strikingly bright backdrop of a bustling Chicago in spring. ‘The Old Marrieds’ begins with the word “but” which seems to imply that the speaker is beginning mid-sentence. This, when considered along with the line being repeated at the opening and close of the piece make it seem like a continuous cycle. The endless march of longing filled days followed by silent, claustrophobic nights. The “old marrieds” are left to trudge forever through their days, a yawning unspoken distance between, even as they lay awake next to each other."

A Bird Song begins with the speaker stating that a certain amount of time, a “year almost,” has passed since he has seen the woman that he loves. There was a time when the two of them were together for an entire summer. The emotions they shared, and the joy that ran between them, lit up the world. Everything appeared in it's most vibrant form. The sky was “bluer” and the grass was “greener.” Additionally, the “brambles” were “fewer.” The speaker did not fear getting cut by thorns or emotionally cut by the one he loved. Unfortunately, this time as passed, and the present summer is only an echo of what once was. The speaker then seemingly jumps to an unrelated topic that the reader will come to understand as the basis of this piece. He begins to describe the mating habits of swallows and how he knows, by their presence, that summer has truly begun. There is no way for him to trick himself into thinking that it is not yet summer, the swallows are there as incontrovertible evidence. As he elaborates on what he sees when he sees the swallows, the reader comes to understand the kind of relationship he is longing for. When the speaker spots one swallow, he knows it's mate is not far behind. The two are never more than a moment apart. This is the type of life he wishes he was still apart of. He wants a love that never ends or takes a break."

1446,1457,1457,"It is the ritual not the fact
That brings a held emotion to
Its breaking-point. This man I knew
Only a little, by his death

Its title is not only appropriate, as per its theme, but it also speaks what the poet wants to convey, that is; talking about funeral rituals of a dead person. The term 'requiem' means a song, sung at the funeral ceremony of a dead person. It is to be noted that not all verses of the poem consist of rhyming, except the endings of the fourth and the sixth line. Moreover, the poet has used several terms that contrast with each other, and differ in connotation, as well. For example; there are the use of terms like 'held', 'breaking point', 'calm', 'distracted', 'cold place' and 'tears'. The poet has, in fact, aligned all these words to the poem's theme, which is paradoxical in itself, for it is not love, but solemnity and seriousness of the last rites and rituals that induce emotions of sorrow and mourning. So, in order to best depict the theme of the poem, the poet has employed appropriate diction, which not only justifies the theme of the poem, but its title, as well."

In the next section, she speaks on how it is God who makes the sunset as beautiful as it is.

1448,1459,1459,"It seemed that out of battle I escaped
Down some profound dull tunnel, long since scooped
Through granites which titanic wars had groined.

Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned,
Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred.
Then, as I probed them, one sprang up, and stared
With piteous recognition in fixed eyes,
Lifting distressful hands, as if to bless.
And by his smile, I knew that sullen hall,— 
By his dead smile I knew we stood in Hell.

With a thousand fears that vision's face was grained;
Yet no blood reached there from the upper ground,
And no guns thumped, or down the flues made moan.

“None,” said that other, “save the undone years,

Which lies not calm in eyes, or braided hair,
But mocks the steady running of the hour,
And if it grieves, grieves richlier than here.
For by my glee might many men have laughed,
And of my weeping something had been left,
Which must die now. I mean the truth untold,
The pity of war, the pity war distilled.
Now men will go content with what we spoiled.
Or, discontent, boil bloody, and be spilled.
They will be swift with swiftness of the tigress. 
None will break ranks, though nations trek from progress.
Courage was mine, and I had mystery;
Wisdom was mine, and I had mastery: 
To miss the march of this retreating world
Into vain citadels that are not walled.
Then, when much blood had clogged their chariot-wheels, 
I would go up and wash them from sweet wells,
Even with truths that lie too deep for taint.
I would have poured my spirit without stint
But not through wounds; not on the cess of war.
Foreheads of men have bled where no wounds were.

Both British and German soldiers lived in terrible conditions, suffered from similar, if not exacting, diseases, and were, on occasion, treated at the same hospitals. At the start of the war, there was even a period of time when German soldiers and British soldiers laid down their arms and had a friendly football match."

telling it, ""You won't have food if you continue to misbehave like this.""

While this poem is written about China, I think it is important to remember that 'China' could be substituted for any country in the world, the ideas behind the poem not only relating to patriotism in one country, but patriotism as a whole."

Father Returning Home by Dilip Chitre expresses the generational separation between a “father” and “children” through vivid visuals that build a scene that is heartbreaking for the “father.” He is unhappy in his life, and the connection he desires with the “children” he loves is denied by those very “children.” Given that the narrator is one of those “children,” a deeper level of devastation can be discovered with a closer inspection of the poem, one that indicates the “children” also can suffer from this generational divide. If one of the “children,” after all, feels the need in later years to express such a morose story of the “father,” the possibility that the child has endured guilt well into adult years from the scenario is strong.

In the end, the poem addresses the heartbreak of the “father” as its core element, but the choice of narration reveals the pain of the child as well. This simple poem then is a representation of the pain endured on both sides of the generational gap."

Anyone can bring to mind the idea of petals; they’re hardly uncommon signs! This is what makes them strong candidates for metaphoric analysis. To write a poem about an abstract concept is no simple test, particularly considering how open to interpretation such concepts are by nature. Creating a central image for poems such as Lowell’s Petals helps significantly with conveying those unique ideas in an accessible and thought-provoking way."

These men belong to a mental hospital, meaning to him that they are “defective” in some way. It is important to note that a contemporary reading of these lines will be colored with new moral standards for thinking and speaking about the disabled. This was not the case when the poem was written, more than fifty years ago. He continues on to describe the work the men do in the fields and conclude with a question for God. Why, he wonders, did God make these people? What could he possibly be trying to say through them that wasn't said through “The eyelid and the rose.”"
1454,1465,1465,"Is it thy will that I should wax and wane,
Barter my cloth of gold for hodden grey,
And at thy pleasure weave that web of pain
Whose brightest threads are each a wasted day?
Is it thy will That my Soul’s House should be a tortured spot
Wherein, like evil paramours, must dwell
Nay, if it be thy will I shall endure,
And sell ambition at the common mart,
And let dull failure be my vestiture,
And sorrow dig its grave within my heart.
Perchance it may be better so I have not made my heart a heart of stone,
Nor starved my boyhood of its goodly feast,
Nor walked where Beauty is a thing unknown.
Many a man hath done so; sought to fence
In straitened bonds the soul that should be free,
Trodden the dusty road of common sense,
While all the forest sang of liberty,
Passed on wide pinion through the lofty air,
To where the steep untrodden mountain height
Caught the last tresses of the Sun God¹s hair.

Followed with wistful eyes the wandering sun
Content if once its leaves were aureoled.

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker directs a question to his lover. It is one of two long questions and is meant rhetorically. He asks them if they are going to make him give up the things he loves, like his gold clothes, and trade them for something worse. Will they, he wonders, force him to suffer from sorrow in his heart? As the speaker goes on, he admits that in the end, it doesn't matter. He's going to do whatever he needs to to make this person happy and he's completely okay with that. He has lived a long and free life that was better than most people ever get to have. The next stanzas are devoted to explaining how different people experience the world. Some look up and see the birds in the sky, and down and see the flowers under their feet, but others never do. He is among the former, making his sacrifice all the more poignant. In the final stanza, with passion, the speaker exclaims over the way that his heart has been spent by the “gorged asp of passion”. He has been drained of much of who he was before by his love, but that's not a bad thing. The speaker is willing to give even more of himself up. He has “known indeed / the love that moves the sun and all the stars!” This makes any sacrifice worth it."

Nelson sets the poem within a classroom, with the teacher giving a lesson on poetry. While other students are not interested in the lesson, a childhood Nelson wants to hear as much as she can, taking a particular interest. The teacher notes her interest in poetry and gives her a poem to read in front of the class the next day. At first, this appears to be the teacher promoting a love of the art but it transpires that the material is full of racial slurs and injustices and the act is designed to humiliate the speaker."

Throughout this poem, the speaker describes for the reader, and sometimes for her heart, how she's feeling. She repeats the word “tired” numerous times throughout the poem, never letting the reader forget her broader emotional and mental experience. She looks back on how her life used to be, and it makes the present all the more painful. The speaker even admits that she'd rather be dead than continue on through her life as she has to without her husband."

No one at all with whom to talk,
But I had the cottages in a row

Of youthful forms and youthful faces.

Some of his most famous works of poetry, such as Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening or The Road Not Taken, including ‘Good Hours,’ do much to express his ability to form entire worlds through words alone, to express and evoke powerful feelings and vivid sentiments through brief snapshots of a moment that can mean everything. ‘Good Hours’ is another powerful example of Frost’s strong abilities in this field. Describing a winter evening walk, Frost takes us through but a brief time in the life of his narrator, but it is a poem filled with emotion and beauty nevertheless. What follows is my personal interpretation of the work."

In the beginning, the stone talks about how it has the power to control time and crush the scissors. The second verse is told from the perspective of the paper. It describes how it has control of “words” and can smother the stone. After that, the scissors say that it can cut paper into tatters and all the beautiful words it has. In the end, the poet depicts how stone, paper, and scissors have different advantages. When they face-off, only one remains as the last object standing. In the case of human beings, the same law is applicable: “They all end alone/ as you will, you will.”"

1460,1471,1471,"First
there was some other order of things
never spoken
but in dreams of darkest creation.
Then there was black earth,
lake, the face of light on water.
Then the thick forest all around
that light,
and then the human clay
whose blood we still carry
rose up in us
who remember caves with red bison
painted in their own blood,
after their kind.
A wildness
swam inside our mothers,
desire through closed eyes,
a new child
wearing the red, wet mask of birth,
delivered into this land
already wounded,
stolen and burned
beyond reckoning.
Red is this yielding land
turned inside out
by a country of hunters
with iron, flint and fire.
Red is the fear
that turns a knife back
against men, holds it at their throats,
and they cannot see the claw on the handle,
the animal hand
that haunts them
from some place inside their blood.
So that is hunting, birth,
and one kind of death.
Then there was medicine, the healing of wounds.
Red was the infinite fruit
of stolen bodies.
The doctors wanted to know
what invented disease
how wounds healed
from inside themselves
how life stands up in skin,
if not by magic.
They divined the red shadows of leeches
that swam in white bowls of water:
they believed stars
in the cup of sky.
They cut the wall of skin
to let
what was bad escape
but they were reading the story of fire
gone out
and that was a science.
As for the animal hand on death’s knife,
knives have as many sides
as the red father of war
who signs his name
in the blood of other men.
And red was the soldier
who crawled
through a ditch
of human blood in order to live.
It was the canal of his deliverance.
It is his son who lives near me.
Red is the thunder in our ears
when we meet.
Love, like creation,
is some other order of things.
Red is the share of fire
I have stolen
from root, hoof, fallen fruit.
And this was hunger.
Red is the human house
I come back to at night
swimming inside the cave of skin
that remembers bison.
In that round nation
of blood
we are all burning,
red, inseparable fires
the living have crawled
and climbed through
in order to live
so nothing will be left
for death at the end.

I want it,
this life.","Red is the thunder in our ears when we meet.

She also describes how all of the histories of the earth is locked away within the blood of her body, and the bodies of all those around her.

The speaker tells us the steady growth of pumpkin from the yellow balls to the matured orange/tawny into its Jack-o-lantern role during Halloween. When Halloween comes around, the children join hands and sing ghost songs around the pumpkin. Though by now it is not the pumpkin seen in the hills but a jack-o-lantern with “terrible teeth,” they are not afraid of it. This response of the children through the perspective of the Pumpkin gives a positive approach to both autumn and Halloween. Halloween isn't just what the pumpkin admires but colorful leaves and the beauty of October.

Holiday's “burned voice” proves that she's a shrewd and masterful performer. At the same time, it has “as many shadows as lights” that marked her as a tragedy, a beaten woman, an addict, a criminal, a prostitute. But Dove's poem allows the reader to see beyond these labels. The poem effectively shifts between past and the present carrying the readers through the complex web of life's high and low to look beyond the sobber story often seen in place of Holiday's life.

He also mentions the supposed benefit pleasing his masters brought him: a rise in rank.

And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.
But when the melancholy fit shall fall
Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,
That fosters the droop-headed flowers all,
And hides the green hill in an April shroud;
Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,
Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,
Or on the wealth of globed peonies;
Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,
Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave,
And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes.
She dwells with Beauty—Beauty that must die;
And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips
Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh,
Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips:
Ay, in the very temple of Delight
Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine,
Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue
Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine;
His soul shalt taste the sadness of her might,
And be among her cloudy trophies hung.","No, no, go not to Lethe, neither twist Wolf's-bane,","Ode on Melancholy,' while not amongst the most lauded of the Great Odes of 1819, is perhaps the most uplifting and hopeful of all of Keat's Odes. Whereas the others dwell on the injustice and the misery of life, in 'Ode on Melancholy,' Keats addresses the Reader, a sufferer of Melancholy, and tells him not to worry – that beauty and pain are intertwined in the world, and that both offer a fuller view of life when occurring in tandem. Melancholy, a notoriously unbeautiful subject, is turned beautiful by Keats' flowing words and his fond address. It is worth pointing out that Keats originally had this written as a four-stanza poem; the first stanza was removed just before it was published in 1820. The missing stanza was as follows: Though you should build a bark of dead men's bones, And rear a phantom gibbet for a mast, Stitch creeds together for a sail, with groans To fill it out, bloodstained and aghast; Although your rudder be a Dragon's tail, Long sever'd, yet still hard with agony, Your cordage large uprootings from the skull Of bald Medusa; certes you would fail To find the Melancholy, whether she Dreameth in any isle of Lethe dull. Harold Bloom stated that should the first stanza have been published, it would have upset the delicate balance of 'Ode on Melancholy,' which is, at its heart, an acceptance of the state of melancholy, an embrace of misery that resonates with the reader in its simplicity."

A slave could row him to,"'Black Nikes' by Harryette Mullen records a group of people's journey to the stars and their desire to leave “all this dirt”. This piece begins with a reference to King Tut (Tutankhamun). His tomb was built on the labor of slaves. According to Mullen, the slaves transported Tut's soul to the stars from the mute crypt of Egypt. Those who were enslaved or worked hard to uphold the successful men's glory wish to leave this world. There is nothing that can inspire them. They saw a lot and digested several forms of torture. Besides, the rest of the poem describes how the speaker exits earth and leaves the dirt of human history behind."

He revels in his predatory nature, fearing nothing and staking his claim on everything. He sees himself as almost god-like; all that is around him is the way it is because he deems it to be that way.

The poem begins with the speaker asking a question. This is only the first of many as she looks for the right descriptor for what it means to be young and what to be anywhere other than where “you” are. Throughout the text, the speaker gives a number of examples. She thinks of how someone would want to be French or Italian, rather than being from Bombay, Glasgow, or Wales. This is a longing that comes with youth, and which is based around a false premise that someone, somewhere is living the perfect life. One that exists without troubles, mundane boredom, or routine of any kind."

The poem begins with the speaker describing how soldiers reside in the land of death and how their profession makes them subject to a more certain destiny. Throughout the first stanza, the speaker describes the horrors of war, the lack of hope for the future, and the dreams which occupy the minds of soldiers. While the guns go off around them they are dreaming of their homes. In the second stanza, the speaker expands on the points he made in the first set of lines. He is attempting to engage a reader's emptiness in regard to the suffering of these men by describing the mundane activities they miss. The soldiers long for the things they once took for granted at home, going to work and playing with “balls and bats.”"
1475,1486,1486,"Congratulations!
Today is your day.
You're off to Great Places!
You're off and away!
You have brains in your head.
You have feet in your shoes.
You can steer yourself
any direction you choose.
You're on your own. And you know what you know.
And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go.
You'll look up and down streets. Look 'em over with care.
About some you will say, ""I don't choose to go there.""
With your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet,
you're too smart to go down any not-so-good street.
And you may not find any
you'll want to go down.
In that case, of course,
you'll head straight out of town.
It's opener there
in the wide open air.
Out there things can happen
and frequently do
to people as brainy
and footsy as you.
And then things start to happen,
don't worry. Don't stew.
Just go right along.
You'll start happening too.
OH!
THE PLACES YOU'LL GO!
You'll be on y our way up!
You'll be seeing great sights!
You'll join the high fliers
who soar to high heights.
You won't lag behind, because you'll have the speed.
You'll pass the whole gang and you'll soon take the lead.
Wherever you fly, you'll be best of the best.
Wherever you go, you will top all the rest.
Except when you don't.
Because, sometimes, you won't.
I'm sorry to say so
but, sadly, it's true
that Bang-ups
and Hang-ups
can happen to you.
You can get all hung up
in a prickle-ly perch.
And your gang will fly on.
You'll be left in a Lurch.
You'll come down from the Lurch
with an unpleasant bump.
And the chances are, then,
that you'll be in a Slump.
And when you're in a Slump,
you're not in for much fun.
Un-slumping yourself
is not easily done.
You will come to a place where the streets are not marked.
Some windows are lighted. But mostly they're darked.
A place you could sprain both your elbow and chin!
Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare to go in?
How much can you lose? How much can you win?
And IF you go in, should you turn left or right...
or right-and-three-quarters? Or, maybe, not quite?
Or go around back and sneak in from behind?
Simple it's not, I'm afraid you will find,
for a mind-maker-upper to make up his mind.
You can get so confused
that you'll start in to race
down long wiggled roads at a break-necking pace
and grind on for miles cross weirdish wild space,
headed, I fear, toward a most useless place.
The Waiting Place...
...for people just waiting.
Waiting for a train to go
or a bus to come, or a plane to go
or the mail to come, or the rain to go
or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow
or the waiting around for a Yes or No
or waiting for their hair to grow.
Everyone is just waiting.
Waiting for the fish to bite
or waiting for the wind to fly a kite
or waiting around for Friday night
or waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle Jake
or a pot to boil, or a Better Break
or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants
or a wig with curls, or Another Chance.
Everyone is just waiting.
NO!
That's not for you!
Somehow you'll escape
all that waiting and staying
You'll find the bright places
where Boom Bands are playing.
With banner flip-flapping,
once more you'll ride high!
Ready for anything under the sky.
Ready because you're that kind of a guy!
Oh, the places you'll go! There is fun to be done!
There are points to be scored. There are games to be won.
And the magical things you can do with that ball
will make you the winning-est winner of all.
Fame! You'll be as famous as famous can be,
with the whole wide world watching you win on TV.
Except when they don't
Because, sometimes they won't.
I'm afraid that some times
you'll play lonely games too.
Games you can't win
'cause you'll play against you.
All Alone!
Whether you like it or not,
Alone will be something
you'll be quite a lot.
And when you're alone, there's a very good chance
you'll meet things that scare you right out of your pants.
There are some, down the road between hither and yon,
that can scare you so much you won't want to go on.
But on you will go
though the weather be foul.
On you will go
though your enemies prowl.
On you will go
though the Hakken-Kraks howl.
Onward up many
a frightening creek,
though your arms may get sore
and your sneakers may leak.
On and on you will hike,
And I know you'll hike far
and face up to your problems
whatever they are.
You'll get mixed up, of course,
as you already know.
You'll get mixed up
with many strange birds as you go.
So be sure when you step.
Step with care and great tact
and remember that Life's
a Great Balancing Act.
Just never foget to be dexterous and deft.
And never mix up your right foot with your left.
And will you succeed?
Yes! You will, indeed!

Throughout the exciting and humorous lines of 'Oh the Places You'll Go,' the speaker explores the future ups and downs, but mostly ups, of a listener's life. They have just entered into a new period where success seems assured, and it is! But that doesn't mean there won't be failures too. The speaker goes back and forth, juxtaposing success against failure and joy against depression. These things are all a part of life and one must be ready to accept that fact. The poem ends happily though with the speaker expressing his belief that “you” will move mountains."

1478,1489,1489,"Far far from gusty waves these children's faces.
Like rootless weeds, the hair torn round their pallor:
The tall girl with her weighed-down head. The paper-
seeming boy, with rat's eyes. The stunted, unlucky heir
Of twisted bones, reciting a father's gnarled disease,
His lesson, from his desk. At back of the dim class
One unnoted, sweet and young. His eyes live in a dream
Of squirrel's game, in tree room, other than this.

On sour cream walls, donations. Shakespeare's head,
Cloudless at dawn, civilized dome riding all cities.
Belled, flowery, Tyrolese valley. Open-handed map
Awarding the world its world. And yet, for these
Children, these windows, not this map, their world,
Where all their future's painted with a fog,
A narrow street sealed in with a lead sky
Far far from rivers, capes, and stars of words.

Surely, Shakespeare is wicked, the map a bad example.
With ships and sun and love tempting them to steal —
For lives that slyly turn in their cramped holes
From fog to endless night? On their slag heap, these children
Wear skins peeped through by bones and spectacles of steel
With mended glass, like bottle bits on stones.
All of their time and space are foggy slum.
So blot their maps with slums as big as doom.

Unless, governor, inspector, visitor,
This map becomes their window and these windows
That shut upon their lives like catacombs,
Break O break open till they break the town

Run azure on gold sands, and let their tongues
Run naked into books the white and green leaves open

Stanza One 'An Elementary School Classroom in a Slum' by Stephen Spender presents the description of the poor children in the first stanza. The children who read in that elementary school have some common physical features. Their faces seem to the poet as “rootless weeds” and their “hair torn around their pallor” or pale face. There is a tall girl in the class. Her physique is so weak that her body cannot hold the weight of her head. The eyes of a boy in the class look like that of a rat. Another boy sitting in the classroom has some hereditary bone disorder. He is seen by the poet reading his lesson. “At the back of the dim class,” an “unnoted, sweet and young” boy is dreaming about the “squirrel's game.” Stanza Two In the second stanza, Stephen Spender says that the white walls or “sour creams walls” of the classroom contain the inscriptions of donations besides the picture of Shakespeare. Thereafter the poet provides the details of the outside world, which is much different from that of the slum kids. There are “civilized domes” and the “flowery” valleys like Australian Tyrol. The kids living in that world have an “open-handed” map to discover whatever places they want. In contrast, the children of the slum school cannot come out of “their world.” The “narrow street” of their world is sealed in with the “lead sky,” symbolizing darkness and pessimism. At last, the poet reiterates that those kids are deprived of the scenic beauties of the “civilized world” mentioned above. Stanza Three The poet thinks that the ships, sun, and love in Shakespeare's works might have tempted the slum children to dream. When they come out of their dreamy world, they find themselves in their “cramped” hole-like rooms and the heap of “slag” around. These children suffer from malnutrition. They have other physical ailments too. There are no scopes of improvement in their “foggy slum.” That's why Stephen Spender tells the privileged class to “blot their maps with slums as big as doom.” Stanza Four At last, the poet is sure about their upheaval. The agents of the upper class have tried to shut the window of opportunity upon their lives. Spender thinks it cannot stop them. One day they will break open the shackles and run to the green fields. The golden sands below and the azure sky above will be their world. Nature with her books' white and green pages will provide knowledge and inspiration. They don't need the linguistics of the “class” since they know the language of nature. With this note of optimism, Stephen Spender ends his poem, 'An Elementary School Classroom in a Slum.'"

Tolkien consists of only two verses, but the structure and approach within them are sufficient to highlight the epic journey before and after the song surfaces in the book. Beyond this connection, reflection, and foreshadowing in regard to the novel and movies, this is also a representation of hope and possibility in life in general. Just as the characters in the story have hope for a good ending—and many reach that place of contentment—ordinary people can have hope while wading through the struggles of life by keeping their place of contentment as the ultimate source of comfort. By doing both—reflecting on the story and providing such a universal, positive message — Tolkien has achieved a work of genius in this pair of verses."

The area she entered into was one that was unified by a different way of speaking. She focuses most specifically on a hawthorn tree as the main feature of the land.

At home I used sit in a winged chair by the window
Overlooking the river and the factory chimneys,
The electricity power station and the car assembly works,
The fleets of trawlers and the pilot tugs,
Dreaming that life is a dream which is real,
The river a reflection of itself in its own waters,

Their mother, my wife, reclined on the couch
Knitting a bright-coloured scarf, drinking a cup of black coffee,
Smoking a cigarette - one of her own roll-ups.

But we called our home 'Windfall'.

In the gut of my head coursed the leaf of tranquility
Which I dreamed was known only to Buddhist Monks
In lotus monasteries high up in the Hindu Kush.
Down here in the dark depths of Ireland,
Below sea level in the city of Cork,
In a city as intimate and homicidal as Little Marseilles,
In a country where all children of the nation
Are not cherished equally
And where the best go homeless, while the worst
Erect block-house palaces - self-regardingly ugly -
Having a home of your own can give to a family
A chance in a lifetime to transcend death.

Firelight at dusk, and city lights;

A lighthouse in the sky flashing green to white to green;
Our black-and-white cat snoozing in the corner of a chair;
Pastels and etchings on the four walls, and over the mantelpiece
'Van Gogh's Grave' and 'Lovers in Water';
A room wallpapered in books and family photograph albums
Chronicling the adventures and metamorphoses of family life:
In swaddling clothes in Mammy's arms on baptism day;

Face-down in a pram, incarcerated in a high chair;
Everybody, including strangers, wearing shop-window smiles;
With Granny in Felixstowe, with Granny in Ballymaloe;
In a group photo in First Infants, on a bike at thirteen;
In the back garden in London, in the back garden in Cork;

As if it were their private sea,
Their own unique, symbiotic fluid
Of which their parents also partook.
Such is home - a sea of your own -
In which you hang upside down from the ceiling
With equanimity, while postcards from Thailand on the mantelpiece
Are raising their eyebrow markings benignly:
Your hands dangling their prayers to the floorboards of your home,
Sifting the sands underneath the surfaces of conversations.
The marine insect life of the family psyche.
A home of your own - or a sea of your own -
In which climbing the walls is as natural
As making love on the stairs;
In which when the telephone rings
Husband and wife are metamorphosed into smiling accomplices,
Both declining to answer it;
Initiating, instead, a yet more subversive kiss -
A kiss they have perhaps never attempted before -
And might never have dreamed of attempting
Were it not for the telephone belling.
Through the bannisters or along the bannister rails
The pyjama-clad children solemnly watching
Their parents at play, jumping up and down in support,
Race back to bed, gesticulating wordlessly:
The most subversive unit in society is the human family.


We're almost home, pet, almost home...
Our home is at...
I'll be home...
I have to go home now...
I want to go home now...
Are you feeling homesick?
Are you anxious to get home?...
I can't wait to get home...
Let's stay at home to tonight and...
What time will you be coming home at?...
If I'm not home by six at the latest, I'll phone...
We're nearly home, don't worry, we're nearly home...

But then with good reason
I was put out of my home:
By a keen wind felled.
I find myself now without a home
Having to live homeless in the alien, foreign city of Dublin.
It is an eerie enough feeling to be homesick
Yet knowing you will be going home next week;
It is an eerie feeling beyond all ornithological analysis
To be homesick knowing that there is no home to go to:
Day by day, creeping, crawling,
Moonlighting, escaping,
Bed-and-breakfast to bed-and-breakfast;
Hostels, centres, one-night hotels.

Homeless in Dublin,
Blown about the suburban streets at evening,
Peering in the windows of other people's homes,
Wondering what it must feel like
To be sitting around a fire -
Apache or Cherokee or Bourgeoisie -
Beholding the firelit faces of your family,
Beholding their starry or their TV gaze:
Windfall to Windfall - can you hear me?
Windfall to Windfall...
We're almost home, pet, don't worry anymore, we're almost home.",A windfall to windfall is a poem of a family whose lives are,"Windfall', 8 Parnell Hill, Cork' by Paul Durcan describes the poet's own relationship to his previous home in Cork and what it meant to him. The poem takes the reader through the poet's memories of this particular home and the joy he took in spending time there. He and his family were together within its walls, doing whatever they wanted to. Durcan would sit at the window, stare out at the landscape, and marvel over his luck that they found such a place. This all changes towards the end as Durcan's marriage breaks up and he's suddenly homeless in Dublin."
1484,1495,1495,"I must not think of thee; and, tired yet strong,
I shun the thought that lurks in all delight—
The thought of thee—and in the blue heaven’s height,
And in the sweetest passage of a song.
Oh, just beyond the fairest thoughts that throng
This breast, the thought of thee waits hidden yet bright;
But it must never, never come in sight;
I must stop short of thee the whole day long.
But when sleep comes to close each difficult day,
When night gives pause to the long watch I keep,
And all my bonds I needs must loose apart,
Must doff my will as raiment laid away,—
With the first dream that comes with the first sleep
I run, I run, I am gathered to thy heart.","I must not think of thee; and, tired yet strong, I shun the thought","'Renouncement' by Alice Meynell is a deeply sad poem in which a speaker describes fighting to control her thoughts. The poem begins with the speaker describing how hard it is for her to ignore thoughts of “thee.” Throughout the entire day, she's forced to cut off any thought of this person she loves for fear of it ruining the rest of the day. She knows she can't operate with thoughts of this person in mind. It's only at the end of the day, when she's going to bed, that she allows herself to give into thoughts of the person she loves and feel as though she is again being embraced by them."

The speaker is asked to watch a young girl at the beginning of the poem and takes care of her for an hour while her mother changes clothes and washes her hair in the bathroom. The mother returns before long, taking the child back. The speaker is somewhat distressed by this. She doesn't want to give the child back and is already looking into the future and trying to remember what she experienced at this moment. She feels like the child's secret guardian, someone who took care of her in an important moment but who no one will remember. This doesn't stop her from feeling connected to her."

The poem takes the reader through the poet's own memories. She delves into moments from her youth in which her mother prepared the house for the new year and set out prosperity guaranteeing foods. The poet references a variety of traditional items, foods, and practices that date her memories. She jumps forward in the second half of the poem, looking to her more recent past in which she met and fell in love with the man who became her husband. The poem concludes with a larger view of the surrounding area and the movements of other celebrators just like her."
1487,1498,1498,"I've tinkered at my bits of rhymes
In weary, woeful, waiting times;
In doleful hours of battle-din,
Ere yet they brought the wounded in;
Through vigils of the fateful night,
In lousy barns by candle-light;
In dug-outs, sagging and aflood,
On stretchers stiff and bleared with blood;
By ragged grove, by ruined road,
By hearths accurst where Love abode;
By broken altars, blackened shrines
I've tinkered at my bits of rhymes.

I've solaced me with scraps of song
The desolated ways along:
Through sickly fields all shrapnel-sown,
And meadows reaped by death alone;
By blazing cross and splintered spire,
By headless Virgin in the mire;
By gardens gashed amid their bloom,
By gutted grave, by shattered tomb;
Beside the dying and the dead,
Where rocket green and rocket red,
In trembling pools of poising light,
With flowers of flame festoon the night.
Ah me! by what dark ways of wrong
I've cheered my heart with scraps of song.

So here's my sheaf of war-won verse,
And some is bad, and some is worse.
And if at times I curse a bit,
You needn't read that part of it;
For through it all like horror runs
The red resentment of the guns.
And you yourself would mutter when
You took the things that once were men,
And sped them through that zone of hate
To where the dripping surgeons wait;
And wonder too if in God's sight
War ever, ever can be right.

Yet may it not be, crime and war
But effort misdirected are?
And if there's good in war and crime,
There may be in my bits of rhyme,
My songs from out the slaughter mill:
So take or leave them as you will.","I've tinkered at my bits of rhymes in weary, woe","The narrator of this poem is a self-described poet, suggesting that in this case, the writer of the poem and the narrator are one and the same. The narrator is described as using their spare time during sorrowful, dark hours to write poetry while waiting for wounded men to come to them. All through the night, they say, and in trenches, on stretchers, in destroyed buildings, and with destroyed people, they write their rhymes. Writing is how the narrator is able to cope with the atrocities described; the descriptions suggest that this is being written at a time of war, a significant battle, where even churches and barns are targets for attack and destruction. The structure of ‘Foreword’ is a simple one — each line is eight syllables long, and the rhyme follows an AABB pattern. In the second verse, the narrator describes the terrors their writings comfort them against; fields, one containing crops, now contain dying plants and shrapnel. The meadows that have survived are reaped only by death, suggesting the farmers are dead or in hiding. No one is safe — “headless Virgins” is a particularly dark description, suggesting that even innocent people are not safe from the soldiers’ march. The capitalization of “Virgins” may also suggest a reference to the Virgin Mary of Christendom. If so, the dual meaning likely indicates that neither innocence nor faith are reasons to be spared by the ongoing war. Amidst all of this, the only solace the narrator holds is their writings, their own way of remaining sane while they are surrounded by this war. The third verse comes as something of a warning — a declaration that because the writings of the speaker are born of war, that some of it will be bad, some of it will be ugly, but all throughout it will be anger, resentment, and utter disdain for the topic. The narrator claims too that they understand if a person would rather not read the uglier writings from the war, but that they also hope the reader will understand that although the subject matter is ugly, the things in the war that inspired them would be enough to turn anyone bitter. If the reader watched, as the narrator watched, as men walked through war zones and became little more than weapons to ultimately be killed or delivered to surgeons, they too would have little choice but to believe that every atrocity is a terrible occurrence that surely could never be tolerated by the highest moral authority — by God. They too would wonder, and so the speaker hopes that they will not be judged for the darkness of their war-songs. As a final verse, the narrator muses about the morality of war, apparently trying to understand the logic that separates a “war crime” from a “crime.” In their view, if there’s anything “good” to be taken out of the tragedy, it might be that a few good poems were composed in its midst. To finish the poem, we are told that it is all the same to the writer whether the reader wishes to read their work or not — for every single one was created amidst slaughter and pain."

Brown makes a statement on the treatment of Black Americans in the custody of the police, denouncing their violent negligence. The poet suggests that he would rather rot away on the floor of his house, being eaten by 'maggots' rather than dying in police custody. Brown invokes the grotesque to further emphasize the awful treatment of Black communities. The final image, a city paying off a grieving mother, is a harrowing depiction of our modern age. Brown argues that money will never bring back those who are dead, life cannot simply be paid off."

He can see the sun acting upon the face of the planet, attempting to dry the rivers, filling the lands with warmth, and envies their close relationship. He values the planet so much that he wants to be a true part of it. He would like to interact as the elements do, melting down and flowing through and into the “pores of nature.” In the second half of the poem, the speaker has come to terms with the fact that this will never be the case. He knows that he is only a small part in a much larger picture. He cannot play the kind of active role he wishes for."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that his ex-lover, who left him or chose to cheat on him, will soon come to regret that choice. He explains that fate, which knows he on his side, is going to reward him in the future. Her “inconstancy” will prove to be a “curse.” In the next section, the speaker goes on to describe what his life is going to be like. It is clear in these lines that he is seeking to make his ex-lover jealous of his hopeful future. Sometime soon he will meet another, one who is more beautiful than she ever was. This new lover will fix his broken and degraded soul, of which the “mistress” was the cause. While the speaker tries to make it seem as if he is over this “mistress,” his words and in the way in which they are put together, show that he is still very hurt. In the final stanza, the speaker takes on the mistress's fate. Due to the fact that she was so disloyal to him, she will suffer greatly in the future. By the end of the poem, he has determined that his mistress will be going to hell because of how she treated him."
1491,1502,1502,"Every one that flatters thee
Is no friend in misery.
Words are easy, like the wind;
Faithful friends are hard to find:

Every man will be thy friend
Whilst thou hast wherewith to spend;
But if store of crowns be scant,
No man will supply thy want.

If that one be prodigal,
Bountiful they will him call,
And with such-like flattering,

Quickly him they will entice;

Words are easy,"'Friends and Flatterers' by William Shakespeare is a poem about friendships, the good kinds and the bad kinds. The speaker starts the poem by telling the listener, someone they believe needs to hear their advice, that there are people who are going to flatter them who aren't true friends. They tell the listener that even if someone compliments you and appears to like you, it doesn't mean that they are going to stand by you in times of need. The following stanzas contain various examples of true and fake friends. They note that wealth, among other things, will draw untrue friends to one's side. When Fortune turns its head, and one loses that which drew their “flatterers” they are going to be left alone. But, if one seeks out true friends, they are going to find comfort whenever they need it."

The skylark, who is free, sings gaily and, when tired, drops to rest in his own nest (not in any cage). The human spirit, too, will be glorified and attain immortality after the death and resurrection of the individual. Thus, the theme of the poem is Resurrection. Similar to the caged skylark, the human individual reacts against his confines, aspires above them, and is frustrated by them. But after Resurrection, the individual will no longer feel encumbered by the flesh or the body. Before we start with the poem, let me tell you that the idea of the spirit being a prisoner in the body was a familiar one during the Renaissance. In John Webster's play, The Duchess of Malfi, there is a passage with which the octave of this sonnet shows a striking similarity: “Didst thou ever see a lark in a cage? Such is the soul in the body: this world is like her little turf of grass, and the heaven over our heads, like her looking-glass, only gives us a miserable knowledge of the small compass of our prison.” Besides, this poem is also said to be a personal allegory of Hopkins's life which was restricted and cramped by his routine duties and by the constant frustration of his creative impulse. The religious life to which he had dedicated himself placed a great mental strain upon him. He never wavered in his devotion, but he had to pay heavily for it. He suffered terrible fits of depression and the torments of self-disgust which came upon him from time to time. All this is reflected in the following lines in the present poem: “This in drudgery, day-labouring-out life's age./ Yet both droop deadly sometimes in their cells/Or wring their barriers in bursts of fear or rage.”"

I ran away. O witches, O misery, O hatred, my treasure's been turned over to you!

I managed to make every trace of human hope vanish from my mind. I pounced on every joy like a ferocious animal eager to strangle it.

I called for executioners so that, while dying, I could bite the butts of their rifles. I called for plagues to choke me with sand, with blood. Bad luck was my god. I stretched out in the muck. I dried myself in the air of crime. And I played tricks on insanity.

And Spring brought me the frightening laugh of the idiot.

So, just recently, when I found myself on the brink of the final squawk! it dawned on me to look again for the key to that ancient party where I might find my appetite once more.

Charity is that key.—This inspiration proves I was dreaming!

""You'll always be a hyena etc. . . ,"" yells the devil, who'd crowned me with such pretty poppies. ""Deserve death with all your appetites, your selfishness, and all the capital sins!""

Ah! I've been through too much:-But, sweet Satan, I beg of you, a less blazing eye! and while waiting for the new little cowardly gestures yet to come, since you like an absence of descriptive or didactic skills in a writer, let me rip out these few ghastly pages from my notebook of the damned.","A while back, if I remember right, my life was one long party where all hearts","'A Season in Hell: Introduction' by Arthur Rimbaud is the striking opening to Rimbaud's long, complex, and infinitely memorable masterpiece. In these lines of 'A Season in Hell,' the speaker introduces his dark and dreary circumstances. He's incredibly sad and destroys any possibility, it seems, of him returning to a happy state. The speaker turns to darkness, crime, and cultivates sin within his own heart. But, at the end of this section, he starts to consider the possibility that this doesn't need to be the case. Perhaps, he can regain his “appetite” for life."

I leave you but the sound of many a word

I sang to heaven. My exile made me free,
from world to world, from all worlds carried me.

Spared by the furies, for the Fates were kind,
I paced the pillared cloisters of the mind;
All times my present, everywhere my place,
Nor fear, nor hope, nor envy saw my face.

Blow what winds would, the ancient truth was mine,
And friendship mellowed in the flush of wine,
And heavenly laughter, shaking from its wings
Atoms of light and tears for mortal things.

Of flesh and spirit was my worship vowed.

He is content with the life he lived and his final contribution to the planet. In the first stanza of this piece, the speaker begins by stating that he is dead. He has left the earth– but not without contributing. His death allowed him to return the energy he was given back to the planet. It went straight into a “furrow,” or ditch dug for agricultural planting. He continues to explain that the only thing he really leaves behind for those still living is his music. This is a reference to written works, poetry or prose. He spent his days involved in the art of writing. This fact separated him from his contemporaries in one way or another—but he didn't mind. His life, he explains, was quite good. He was blessed by the “fates” and never touched by the “furies.' In the final two stanzas, he explains that he spent a great deal of his life utilizing the emotions of his relationships in his writing. He found great happiness while alive and this was enough to form his “imperfect prayers.” In the last lines, he asks that all the beauty of the earth, that his body is now contributing to, finishes his “prayers.”"

I was in Berlin, in winter. The light
was without light, the sky without sky.
The air white like wet bread.
And from my window a vacant arena,
bitten by the teeth of winter.
Suddenly led by a man,
ten horses stepped out into the mist.
Hardly had they surged forth, like flame,
than to my eyes they filled the whole world,
empty till then. Perfect, ablaze,
they were like ten gods with pure white hoofs,
with manes like a dream of salt.
Their rumps were worlds and oranges.
Their color was honey, amber, fire.
Their necks were towers
cut from the stone of pride,
and behind their transparent eyes
energy raged, like a prisoner.
And there, in the silence, in the middle
of the day, of the dark, slovenly winter,
the intense horses were the blood
and rhythm, the animating treasure of life.
I looked. I looked and was reborn: without knowing it,
there, was the fountain, the dance of gold, the sky,
the fire that revived in beauty.

I will not forget the light of the horses.", The light of the horses was the light of life.</s,"Horses' by Pablo Neruda is a beautiful poem filled with imagery related to light, darkness, and hope amongst sorrow. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker spends time discussing the dark Berlin winter. It's a terrible time to be in the city. The air is like “white wet bread,” and everything is drab and colorless. In a moment that stands out beyond all others to the speaker, he looks down at horses in the city. These horses, which are actually part of a fountain, depict freedom, strength, and beauty in a way the speaker had never experienced before."

It is a celebration of love, a reiteration of love, a reckless abandonment of the tenets of restraint and silence (remember that Barrett Browning was writing in the Victorian era, where women were not expected to have very strong emotions, and definitely not expected to write love poetry of such an intimate nature! It was scarcely accepted for men to do so, let alone women) to shout out to everyone about their love, in this case, husband-to-be Robert Barrett Browning. It follows a simple rhyme scheme of ABBCCDDEFGFGFG, which leans more towards the Italian style than the English style, thus having a turn around the eighth or ninth line that moves Sonnet 29 from proposition to solution. It is interesting to note that though the language is very reminiscent of Shakespeare, one would have trouble reading this in iambic pentameter, as the stresses don't slot into place as easily as one would expect. Sonnet 29 is a passionate lamentation from Elizabeth to her husband (we can assume that, knowing the history and provenance of the poem and the collection), who tells him that he is always on her mind."

'Done is a Battell on the Dragon Blak' starts strong by telling of a battle Christ has already won against “the black dragon” who is Lucifer. The poet persona lets readers know it's a battle to free the saints from captivity. The poem foreshadows the saints' freedom—through Christ's resurrection—with the Latin refrain, “Surrexit dominus de sepulchro,” meaning, “The Lord is risen from the grave.” As the poem progresses, the speaker elaborates on the battle Christ fought for the saints. They call Lucifer different names throughout the poem—tiger, serpent, etc. Also Christ—lamb, giant, etc. The persona tells readers Christ fought for the people on Earth through His crucifixion and death. Moreover, they narrate Christ's resurrection afterward as a sign of triumph. The poet persona relates this triumph to the introduction of light and the arrival of the day. At the poem's conclusion, the speaker tells readers the implication of Christ's victory for the saints: deliverance, peace, and a re-established faith. "

this treadmill whose frayed tide
fretted with mud

leaves our suburban shoreline littered
with rainbow muck, the afterbirth

streaked bungalows

through a dark aisle
of fountaining, gold coconuts, an oasis
marked for the yellow Caterpillar tractor.

through its swift-wickered shade there always is
some island schooner netted in its weave

like a lamed heron
an oil-crippled gull;
a few more yards upshore

and it heaves free,
it races the horizon
with us, railed to one law,

ruled, like the washed-up moon
to circle her lost zone,
her radiance thinned.

but we are bound elsewhere,
from the last sacred wood.","'Year round, year round, we'll ride this treadmill whose fraye","'Ebb' by Derek Walcott is an image-rich poem about a speaker's car journey by the seashore. The poem begins metaphorically, referring to the world as a treadmill that humans ride each day. With rapid industrialization, the world around the speaker has also changed. From his car, he can notice the polluted sea and the monotonous buildings and factories. Surprisingly, he notices a schooner visible from the shade of the trees growing in an oasis still untouched. This schooner reminds him of lost boyhood. When his car moves far from the oasis as well as the schooner, he starts thinking about his own mortality and how terrifying, and miraculous habitual day-to-day scenes are."

The last time he was there with him, he could only touch his food, lifeless hands. In contrast, the speaker's friend neglected his father in their last meeting. He told him that he had something important to do. Then he left."

a hole in a uniform, patching a tire,
repairing the things in need of repair.

Someone is trying to make music somewhere,
with a pair of wooden spoons on an oil drum,
with cello, boom box, harmonica, voice.

A farmer considers the changing sky.
A teacher says, Take out your pencils. Begin.

spiny or smooth, whispered or declaimed,
words to consider, reconsider.

We cross dirt roads and highways that mark
the will of some one and then others, who said
I need to see what’s on the other side.

I know there’s something better down the road.
We need to find a place where we are safe.
We walk into that which we cannot yet see.

who laid the train tracks, raised the bridges,

picked the cotton and the lettuce, built
brick by brick the glittering edifices
they would then keep clean and work inside of.

Praise song for every hand-lettered sign,
the figuring-it-out at kitchen tables.

others by first do no harm or take no more

Love beyond marital, filial, national,
love that casts a widening pool of light,

Afterward, there is a reference to the path shown by the Americans who lived before. Without their contribution, the road to advancement would have remained unseen or undiscovered. That's why she praises everyone who was there for the country. She, along with her fellow citizens, is walking forward to the light of the future shown by their ancestors.

In the first stanza of this poem, the speaker describes snow falling from the sky and landing on the empty woodland and the abandoned fields. Once dark and somewhat gloomy places are livened by the addition of this pure white snow. But, as the next two stanzas reveal, Longfellow does not see the snow as an entirely happy image. In fact, the rest of the poem is devoted to comparing the sky letting snow fall to the ground to a human being in confession or announcing their grief to the world. The snow is, he concludes, “the secret of despair” that was long-hoarded in the sky's “bosom” and now falls on field and wood."

The poem begins with the speaker bemoaning the fact that “heaven [is] built so far” from the confines of Earth. As well as the fact that Earth is “set so remote” from heaven. It is as if all factors of God and man are working against her. She is unable to even get close to the “nearest star” in the sky, much less God. The speaker is frustrated by the fact that even if she wanted to, she could not reach the “monotonous” round, moon. It teases and torments her in it's unchanging “tune.” She speaks of how her passion for heaven haunts her. She is unable to look at the sun or the stars and not feel mournful over her situation. It follows her day in and day out. 'De Profundis' concludes with the speaker saying that she is doing all of the spiritual and physical reachings that she is able to, and still all is beyond her grasp. She knows that her bonds on Earth will keep her from reaching heaven but she cannot stop hoping."

The poem begins with the speaker describing how deeply one would have to look in the ocean to find the Kraken. It is in a place no human can truly go. He continues on to state that the Kraken is not the king of this place, but just another feature. This is due to the fact that he has been sleeping an “ancient” sleep. He has become a home for all the creatures of the deep. In the final lines of the poem, it is revealed that eventually, the Kraken will wake up, it will bring all its power to man and angels alike, and then die when it reaches the surface."

One such suggestion is that coming out of the room and visualizing nature as it is. This will help the poet to paint the picture in words.

The mother asks him what he thought he was doing as the stone has no idea whether it's in a garden or in a house. It's sleeping, she adds. The son expresses his desire to keep the stone captive because it's his; he's conquered it. He's doing it because it's something he can control.

For his infidelity, he has forsaken a person who is even true at heart even after his departure. The speaker strongly proclaims that she will forever remain the same.

The speaker begins this piece by describing a storm that has come in “above the lifted shore.” The storm is dense, dark, and “mute.” It has a muffling impact on the surrounding lands and people. There are only a few sounds that are able to get through and the loudest comes from the storm itself. The “repercussive roar” of thunder breaks the silence, as does the sound of “foot” falls on “rocks remote” and the yelling of sailors at sea. Additionally, the sound of men working the clocktower in town perseveres. These sounds are heard under the worst of circumstances. Although all should be consumed, still life goes on. In the second half of the sonnet, the speaker states that there are two lighted paths in the darkness that are visible. The first is created by the white surf of the beach. It runs parallel to the water and is a safe guide for one to follow. The second is more dangerous. It is the path created by the lights of ships on the water. If one was to follow these lights, they would surely drown. By contrasting these two situations the speaker is able to depict how in darkness one still has the ability to succeed.

This piece begins with the day-to-day happenings inside a railway station. The speaker is waiting for his train. On the platform, he encounters a man who talks a lot. A fat guy shows up. He is in a sulky mood after being beaten by a billy club. The speaker shuts his eyes to this scene and boards the train of thoughts destined for the afterlife. He realizes what it feels like after death. However, it's no big deal for him. It is more like tasting the same greasy hamburger and sipping chilled Pepsi."

Ramanujan describes how poets of the past and present have romanticized a river in Madurai. The poem begins with the speaker stating that every year, every poet sings the same songs about the sometimes flooding, and sometimes empty riverbed. When it is empty, all its hidden items are exposed. The poets have always sung about this period and the other in which the flood happens. But, they don't get into the details of who is impacted. In the next stanzas, the speaker relays the words of the citizens of this area as they describe what happened this year. Houses were washed away, as were two cows and a woman who thought she was pregnant with twins. The speaker derides the old and new poets for not caring enough to look deeper into their environments."

The poet describes, in the first lines, the word “elver” and how she uses it to apply to the silver water and the cirrus clouds around Dublin. The word itself feels out of place until it's reused at the poem's end to describe an eel. The poet focuses on one specific area of the city, around the historic Blackrock Baths, and depicts them while they were still in operation more than 50 years ago. She describes how she found out later, as an adult, that once an eel made its way into the water. She embellishes this story, personifying the city and the eel and suggesting that it was “yearning” for the estuary."

Through cool, green shadows;
Little leaves hung in the soft air

They marched with fluttering flags,
And gay fifes playing!

I wanted to march in the wind,
To tear the silence with gay music,
And to slash the sober green

The poem begins with the speaker stating that she is in the woods, walking down a “gray path.” There is nothing too bright or bold before her. In fact, everything is quite peaceful. There are a few interesting sounds, and a beautiful lilac on the forest floor, but nothing more than that. All of a sudden, coming as a surprise to both the speaker and the reader, there is a path of bright red tulips on the side of the road. This appearance, and the strength which with the flowers assert themselves, inspire the speaker to change. She sees them, feels their power, and wishes that she could be as they are. She no longer cares for the silence of the woods. If she could, she would tear the silence to pieces. The poem concludes with the speaker realizing that some internal part of her being has been seen by the tulips. "

For Crooker, the rushing waters that flow past the poet as she stands in the freezing lake represent grieving – she wallows in the water, enjoying its icy sadness. She refuses to move from her location, submitting to grief, and not trying to change. There is an element of seeing the other side of the river, representing coming to terms with grief. Yet, Crooker never reaches the other side, not wanting to let go of the memory she holds of her deceased loved one."

Housman is a short poem that addresses the sacrifices soldiers made during World War I. The poem notes from the start that the speaker/s is dead. They lost their lives in order to avoid a worse fate—shame. They chose to die because they didn't want to shame the country they came from. The poem alludes to war, specifically World War I, through its lines. The poet uses irony in order to suggest that the opposite of what he's saying is actually true. Life is quite a precious thing to lose, but the speaker/s suggests the opposite. When they were young, they believe it, but now they know that life is meaningless in the face of shaming one's country."
1520,1531,1531,"After the last bulletins the windows darken
And the whole city founders readily and deep,
Sliding on all its pillows
To the thronged Atlantis of personal sleep,

And the wind rises. The wind rises and bowls
The day’s litter of news in the alleys. Trash
Tears itself on the railings,
Soars and falls with a soft crash,

Tumbles and soars again. Unruly flights
Scamper the park, and taking a statue for dead
Strike at the positive eyes,
Batter and flap the stolid head

And scratch the noble name. In empty lots
Our journals spiral in a fierce noyade
Of all we thought to think,
Or caught in corners cramp and wad

And twist our words. And some from gutters flail
Their tatters at the tired patrolman’s feet,
Like all that fisted snow
That cried beside his long retreat

Damn you! damn you! to the emperor’s horse’s heels.
Oh none too soon through the air white and dry
Will the clear announcer’s voice
Beat like a dove, and you and I

From the heart’s anarch and responsible town
Return by subway-mouth to life again,
Bearing the morning papers,
And cross the park where saintlike men,

White and absorbed, with stick and bag remove
The litter of the night, and footsteps rouse
With confident morning sound
The songbirds in the public boughs.",The wind rises and bowls the day’s litter of news in the alleys,"'After the Last Bulletins' by Richard Wilbur is about the human race's ability to discard what we once deemed important. The poem begins with the speaker, who is later revealed to be a newspaper deliveryman, describing how after an entire day is done, the newspapers of that morning have been read, and the world is tired, all fall into a deep “personal sleep.” While the people sleep, the city does not. Out in the streets, the “wind rises” and it blows the “day's litter” in this case, newspapers, through the alleys. What was once important, that day's news, is now worthless and considered “litter.” Breaking news so quickly becomes discardable history. Continuing on the speaker describes how the papers bash themselves against historical statues in the park. These are objects of permanence representing the same things that the newspapers do, history. One is revered and preserved while the other is stepped on in the street and trapped in gutters. Additionally, the speaker points out that personal “journals” have been discarded and their history also considered trash; it joins in the flight through the streets. Some papers get stuck in gutters and the scraps flutter up from the grates at the feet of on-duty patrolmen who walk the streets. Neither they, nor the public at large, take note of the history that is so wantonly discarding. At this point, it becomes clear that not only is the speaker concerned with how the human race treats objects in our consumerist culture but also how we understand the importance of our own history. The last stanzas of the poem restart the entire process over again. Those that deliver papers are once more called to the “emperors horse's heels” and take their orders from the announcer. Together they travel through the subway and emerge from it's “mouth.” They pass through the park and see the city workers cleaning up last night's trash, that previous morning's deliveries. They know that the bundles they carry will be subjected to the same fate. The last line of the poem describes how no one in the city is the wiser that this has gone on. The songbirds will sing and the public will wake up once more to their breaking news."

Heart, fear nothing,","Love in a Life' by Robert Browning tells of a speaker's seemingly endless quest to find his lover within the numerous rooms of their shared home. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is on a journey to find his lover in their house. He is going from room to room, “hunt[ing]” for “her.” He speaks to his heart, telling it not to worry, as they will soon find her. The speaker constantly feels as if he's about to catch up to his lover. He can smell her on the curtains and sense her presence on the furniture. In the second stanza he states that although he has not yet succeeded, he plans to. He is going to continue to search and as it is only “twilight” there are still many doors to open and rooms to enter."

But simple I according to my skill.
From School-boy’s tongue no Rhet’ric we expect,
Nor yet a sweet Consort from broken strings,
Nor perfect beauty where’s a main defect.

‘Cause Nature made it so irreparable.
Nor can I, like that fluent sweet-tongued Greek

The poet takes the reader should several different reasons and ways that her poetry, as a woman, is inferior to male writing. She believes, as women were taught to in her time, that she has a weaker brain. This keeps her from attempting to write on historical topics or anything of worldly importance. There are a few arguments within the poem for a woman's ability to write but she always comes back around the placating the men who might be upset by her choice to writ rather than sew."
1523,1534,1534,"One the road to the bay was a lake of rushes
Where we bathed at times and changed in the bamboos.
Now it is rather to stand and say
How many roads we take that lead to Nowhere,
The alley overgrown, no meaning now but loss:
Not that veritable garden where everything comes easy.

And by the bay itself were cliffs with carved names
And a hut on the shore by the Maori ovens.
We raced boats from the banks of the pumice creek
Or swam in those autumnal shallows
Growing cold in amber water, riding the logs
Upstream, and waiting for the taniwha.

So now I remember the bay and the little spiders
On driftwood, so poisonous and quick.

With currents round the rocks and the birds rising.

And burned for the sake of going on living.

Baxter talks about the loss of natural beauty of the bay and the area surrounding it. 'The Bay' by James K. Baxter shares the poet's memories of childhood. Children living near that area about which the poet refers to in this poem were close to nature. They bathed in a lake on the way to the bay and changed their clothes in a bamboo forest. Moreover, they raced boats and rode the logs floating on the autumnal shallows. But now the mature poet misses those memories and laments the natural loss in front of his eyes. Everything has changed. From the roads they ran, the areas surrounding the bay and the bay itself depict the effect of modernization. The water of the bay that once gave solace to the poet's childish spirit, now “stand like stone and cannot turn away”."

Ashcans and unobtainable,"'Howl' by Allen Ginsberg is an indictment of modern society and celebrates anyone who lived outside its standards. The poem explores the poet's “mad” friends in the first section. He describes their drug use, sexual habits, and how they sought meaning in their everyday lives. The second section deals with what drove his friends mad. Then, the third section is very clearly devoted to Carl Solomon and what he, and other men like him, endured in mental hospitals at the time."

From fields where glory does not stay,
And early though the laurel grows
It withers quicker than the rose.

Housman is an image-rich and metrically steady poem that is directed to a young man who has died in early death. In this poem, the speaker begins by recalling a young athlete who won a small-town race. He was celebrated by everyone around him. Now, in the present, the athlete is being celebrated in a very different way. He's died and is being carried back home. He died gloriously and the speaker seems to praise him for it. The speaker follows this up by providing the reader with a series of dark and thoughtful images that allude to the loss the town has suffered and the future the young man will never get to have. He also brings in images of the afterlife and the crown the young man will be wearing there."

It is clear through these aspects of the poem that Hood prefers the childish imagination, and the passing of it is treated as a sad thing. In this, the reader can infer that theme of the poem is that childish wonder is a beautiful element of life, one that is progressively forgotten but “should” always be grieved."
1527,1538,1538,"love lasts by not lasting
—Jack Gilbert
I’m mapping this new year’s vanishings: lover, yellow house, the knowledge of surfaces.
This is not a story of return.
There are times I wish I could erase
the mind’s lucidity, the difficulty of Sundays,
my fervor to be touched
by a woman two Februarys gone. What brings the body
back, grieved and cloven, tromping these woods
with nothing to confide in? New snow reassumes
the circleting trees, the bridge above the creek
where I stand like a stranger to my life.
There is no single moment of loss, there is
an amassing. The disbeliever sleeps at an angle
in the bed. The orchard is a graveyard.
Is this the real end? Someone shoveling her way out
with cold intention? Someone naming her missing?", 'love lasts by not lasting' by Jack Gilbert</s,"Snowshoe to Otter Creek by Stacie Cassarino begins with looking at what 'vanishings' have happened this year, everything the poet has lost. This comprises 'a lover, yellow house, the knowledge of surfaces', with the loss of love and home security being core things that are now missing from her life. It is the loss of her lover that propels the poem, the melancholy tone stemming from this 'vanishing'. The poet reflects on her life, considering the presence of 'loss', the world around her and the promise of a future. There is no positive affirmation or change towards the end of the poem, with Cassarino only furthering the deep sense of loss and isolation the voice of the poem feels."

Pages of a book, and the white ceiling

Like starch of a nurse, reflects a calm feeling.

The daughter, with hands outstretched to the fire,

Transmits through her veins the peaceful desire

Of the family tree, from which she was born,

To push tendrils through dark to a happier dawn.

In the ancient house or the glass-and-steel flat

The vertical descendants of the genes that

Go back far in the past, are supported by floors

And protected by walls from the weather outdoors.

In the complex stage settings they act out the parts

Of their bodies enclosing their human hearts

With limbs utilizing chairs, tables, cups,

All the necessities and props.

They wear the right clothes and go the right ways,

Read the news, and play golf, and fill out their days

With hobbies, meals brought from the kitchen range.

And no one sees anything eerie or strange

In all this. And perhaps they are right. Nothing is

Until an unreasoning fury impinges

From an enemy’s vision of life, on their hearth.

And explodes. And tears their loved home down to earth.

Rubble decently buries the dead human meat.

Piled above it, a bath, a wardrobe, books, telephone

Though all who could answer its ringing have gone.

Standing unscathed in one solitary wall,

Half a floor attached, forgotten to fall.

Convolvulus patterns of pink and blue line

Bemused passers-by are bound to observe

That inside-shown-outside like the deep curve

Of mother-o’-pearl exposed in a shell

Where a mollusc, long-smashed, at one time did dwell.

But the house has been cracked in an enemy’s claws,

Years of love ground down to rubble in jaws,

And the tender sensitive life thrown away

By the high-flying will of the enemy’s day.","The house has been cracked in an enemy’s claws, Years of love ground down to","'Air Raid' by Stephen Spender describes how people's homes and hopes were destroyed by the German air raid during World War II. This poem begins with calm and pedantic images of English domestic life during the Second World War. The speaker describes human beings in a mechanical fashion in order to draw readers' attention to the fact that they all were unimportant to the mighty force. They carried on with their lives, their hopes, and their dreams without bothering much about what was happening outside. Everything was alright until the German bomber planes destroyed their hearths within a flash and turned their homes inside out, burying them decently under the debris of humanity."
1529,1540,1540,"As I walked out one evening,
Walking down Bristol Street,
The crowds upon the pavement
Were fields of harvest wheat.
And down by the brimming river
I heard a lover sing
Under an arch of the railway:
‘Love has no ending.
‘I’ll love you, dear, I’ll love you
Till China and Africa meet,
And the river jumps over the mountain
And the salmon sing in the street,
‘I’ll love you till the ocean
Is folded and hung up to dry
And the seven stars go squawking
Like geese about the sky.
‘The years shall run like rabbits,
For in my arms I hold
The Flower of the Ages,
And the first love of the world.’
But all the clocks in the city
Began to whirr and chime:
‘O let not Time deceive you,
You cannot conquer Time.
‘In the burrows of the Nightmare
Where Justice naked is,
Time watches from the shadow
And coughs when you would kiss.
‘In headaches and in worry
Vaguely life leaks away,
And Time will have his fancy
To-morrow or to-day.
‘Into many a green valley
Drifts the appalling snow;
Time breaks the threaded dances
And the diver's brilliant bow.
'O plunge your hands in water,
Plunge them in up to the wrist;
Stare, stare in the basin
And wonder what you've missed.
‘The glacier knocks in the cupboard,
The desert sighs in the bed,
And the crack in the tea-cup opens
A lane to the land of the dead.
‘Where the beggars raffle the banknotes
And the Giant is enchanting to Jack,
And the Lily-white Boy is a Roarer,
And Jill goes down on her back.
'O look, look in the mirror,
O look in your distress:
Life remains a blessing
Although you cannot bless.
‘O stand, stand at the window
As the tears scald and start;
You shall love your crooked neighbour
With your crooked heart.’

And the deep river ran on.","A symphony of love, a poem of love, a poem","'As I Walked Out One Evening' by W. H. Auden is a complex poem about life, death, and disillusionment. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker informs readers that they are recalling a memory. He thinks about going on a walk through the city in the evening and seeing the crowds around him. Near a river, under a railway arch, the speaker hears young lovers singing. The lovers are suggesting that “love lasts forever.” They sing about how they are going to love until impossible things happen. Still thinking back on this memory, the speaker hears the cities clocks singing and responding to the lovers. They tell the young, enamored people that “nobody wins against Time.” No matter the strength of one's love, Time is always going to win out. The beauty of love does not last, the clock says. Everyday worries eventually degrade it and death comes for everyone. The clock, which had at first been speaking only to these young lovers, seems to direct its words to all readers of this poem. The clock tells everyone to consider everything they've missed out on. In the afterlife, everything is meaningless and corrupt. It is a dark place, where things are different from how one imagined. The clocks also tell the listener to look in the mirror and see one's own unhappiness. Life, the clocks say, is a gift even when it seems like a curse. The poem concludes with the speaker noting that the clocks stop singing and that it's now late in the evening. The lovers have left and everything is the same as it was before."

Of absence, darkness, death: things which are not.

The poem begins with the speaker stating that it is the Winter Solstice, the shortest day, and longest night of the year. He refers to it as the year's midnight. At the time at which Donne was writing the calendar put Saint Lucy's Day on the same day as the solstice. He is able to make use of Lucy (her name meaning light) and employ the sun as a metaphor for love and hope (or lack thereof). He spends a great deal of time describing the poor condition the world is in. Everything is dead, just like his own soul and being. The speaker feels that he is in an even worse state than the dead, withered natural landscape. He is its epitaph. He goes on to describe what happened to him. His saga began with love transforming him into a happy, fulfilled being, and then changing him again into a dead, grave-like one. It is due to “Love” that he is the way he is. It takes a few more lines before a reader is informed that the speaker's lover is dead. Together they were happy, and when apart they were desperate for one another. Now, the separation is permanent and the speaker does not see any reason to continue living. In fact, mentally and emotionally he feels as if he is already dead. The poem concludes with the speaker wishing another lover's a happy spring season. He does not wish his fate on anyone and hopes that they will take advantage of love while they have it. He also adds that this day, Saint Lucy's Day and the Winter Solstice, is the perfect occasion to hold a vigil for his lost lover. It is the midnight of the year and the season."

In the first five lines of the poem, the speaker starts by listing out many of the things that one might encounter while camping.

Despite all of these things, some of which are more fun than others, the speaker loves spending time outside, especially when it's dark."

When kisses","'September' by Ted Hughes is a beautifully complex poem that speaks on the end of a period of time, or perhaps of an important relationship. The poem takes the reader through a series of images that outline a state of being outside of time and within memory. The speaker describes how “we,” presumably him and his lover, sit and watch the world changing around them. There is no “clock” to count the changes that are occurring, it is something more emotional and ephemeral. Hughes focuses on small moments, like the feeling of someone's wrist, while repeatedly emphasizing that time means nothing. The poem concludes with the entrancing image of “trees casting their crowns / Into pools” which alludes to the change that Hughes has been hinting at throughout the piece."

The four lines of this rhyme depict the statue as “black” and include the speaker's description of his heart bursting at the sight. The use of the word “black” twice might suggest that the speaker feels negatively about the statue. This would lead readers to the interpretation that the final line is a bit of sarcasm/satire that's meant to make fun of those who actually feel heartbroken over the king's death.

One such morning, he wakes up and notices a rooster on the windowsill, mistaking it for the sun. After waking up, he finds the dead body of his wife, Juanita lying face down near the sugarcane field. He picks her body and carries it on the wagon used for transporting the crops. After doing so, he thinks her wife's grief could sweeten the production."

Screen'd by deep boughs on either hand;
And at its end, to stay the eye,

Birds here make song, each bird has his,
Across the girdling city's hum.
How green under the boughs it is!
How thick the tremulous sheep-cries come!
Sometimes a child will cross the glade
To take his nurse his broken toy;
Sometimes a thrush flit overhead
Deep in her unknown day's employ.

What blowing daisies, fragrant grass!

Counts his day's spoil, the spotted trout.

The power to feel with others give!

The poem begins with the speaker describing how he is lying in the only open glade, or path of the treeless forest. This place is “deep” in the boughs of the forest. He is surrounded by trees on all sides, isolated from the larger world. In the next stanzas, a reader is reminded that he is not in the wilderness but in the gardens of Kensington in London. There is a city on all sides and children who run through the forest. He is not alone. The human-made elements of his environment do not bother him though. He is able to take as much from this curated landscape as he would from one that is less altered by human hands. The speaker continues to return to the birds throughout this piece. He is interested in their comings and goings and the general history of the landscape. The speaker takes the time to analyze the ground at his feet and think about all the creatures, human and non-human who have moved through there. As 'Lines Written in Kensington Gardens' continues the speaker begins to fantasize about taking the calm of the gardens back into his real life. There is nothing but raving men in the city and he does not want to hear or become one of them. Due to the nature of the city, he states that he has often thought that there was no true peace to be found in life. It was only death that could bring one any measure of calm. Now that he has spent time in the garden he knows this isn't the case. By the end of the poem, he is pleading with the higher power which created the garden to allow him to bring the “Calm soul” of living things back to his city life."
1536,1547,1547,"You always read about it:
the plumber with the twelve children
who wins the Irish Sweepstakes.
From toilets to riches.

who captures the oldest son's heart.
from diapers to Dior.
That story.

Or a milkman who serves the wealthy,
eggs, cream, butter, yogurt, milk,
the white truck like an ambulance
who goes into real estate
and makes a pile.
From homogenized to martinis at lunch.

Or the charwoman
who is on the bus when it cracks up
and collects enough from the insurance.
From mops to Bonwit Teller.
That story.

Once
the wife of a rich man was on her deathbed
and she said to her daughter Cinderella:
Be devout. Be good. Then I will smile
down from heaven in the seam of a cloud.
The man took another wife who had
two daughters, pretty enough
but with hearts like blackjacks.
Cinderella was their maid.
She slept on the sooty hearth each night
and walked around looking like Al Jolson.
Her father brought presents home from town,
jewels and gowns for the other women
but the twig of a tree for Cinderella.
She planted that twig on her mother's grave
and it grew to a tree where a white dove sat.
Whenever she wished for anything the dove
would drop it like an egg upon the ground.
The bird is important, my dears, so heed him.

Next came the ball, as you all know.
It was a marriage market.
The prince was looking for a wife.
All but Cinderella were preparing
and gussying up for the event.
Cinderella begged to go too.
Her stepmother threw a dish of lentils
into the cinders and said: Pick them
up in an hour and you shall go.
The white dove brought all his friends;
all the warm wings of the fatherland came,
and picked up the lentils in a jiffy.
No, Cinderella, said the stepmother,
you have no clothes and cannot dance.
That's the way with stepmothers.

Cinderella went to the tree at the grave
and cried forth like a gospel singer:
Mama! Mama! My turtledove,
send me to the prince's ball!
The bird dropped down a golden dress
and delicate little slippers.
Rather a large package for a simple bird.
So she went. Which is no surprise.
Her stepmother and sisters didn't
recognize her without her cinder face
and the prince took her hand on the spot
and danced with no other the whole day.

As nightfall came she thought she'd better
get home. The prince walked her home
and she disappeared into the pigeon house
and although the prince took an axe and broke
it open she was gone. Back to her cinders.
These events repeated themselves for three days.
However on the third day the prince
covered the palace steps with cobbler's wax
and Cinderella's gold shoe stuck upon it.
Now he would find whom the shoe fit
and find his strange dancing girl for keeps.
He went to their house and the two sisters
were delighted because they had lovely feet.
The eldest went into a room to try the slipper on
but her big toe got in the way so she simply
sliced it off and put on the slipper.
The prince rode away with her until the white dove
told him to look at the blood pouring forth.
That is the way with amputations.
They just don't heal up like a wish.
The other sister cut off her heel
but the blood told as blood will.
The prince was getting tired.
He began to feel like a shoe salesman.
But he gave it one last try.
This time Cinderella fit into the shoe
like a love letter into its envelope.

At the wedding ceremony
the two sisters came to curry favor
and the white dove pecked their eyes out.
Two hollow spots were left
like soup spoons.

Cinderella and the prince
lived, they say, happily ever after,
like two dolls in a museum case
never bothered by diapers or dust,
never arguing over the timing of an egg,
never telling the same story twice,
never getting a middle-aged spread,
their darling smiles pasted on for eternity.
Regular Bobbsey Twins.
That story.","Cinderella and the prince lived happily ever after, like two dolls in a museum","'Cinderella' by Anne Sexton is a brilliant and haunting retelling of the classic fairy tale of the same name. Throughout the poem, Sexton takes the story of Cinderella and changes it in order to present a narrative that is, in the end, critical of itself. The story follows the young Cinderella as she suffers at the hands of her stepmother and stepsisters. A dove brings her everything she asks for though and it is eventually that dove that helps her attend the ball. There is a fairly gruesome section of the poem towards the end when the stepsisters mutilate themselves in order to try to marry the prince. Then finally, the prince finds Cinderella. Their “happily ever after” is much more disturbing that one might expect, with Sexton suggesting that this idealized ending leaves much to be desired."

In this poem, Campion describes that a man can get jealous even without reason. They can get discontented and not talk about their feelings. Sometimes, the poet says they make a show of their love. According to him, courtship is a “disguise.” Sometimes, true hearts might have “dissembling eyes,” referring to the fake expressions. Lovers might disguise their true feelings under a smile. Lastly, the poet describes that men can hunt and hawk, but they cannot sit down and communicate with their partners. So, he warns women that they may think of a relationship with men if they can handle such behaviors."
1538,1549,1549,"Say! You’ve struck a heap of trouble –
Bust in business, lost your wife;

You don’t care a cent for life;
Hard luck has of hope bereft you,
Health is failing, wish you die –
Why, you’ve still the sunshine left you And the big, blue sky.
Sky so blue it makes you wonder
If it’s heaven shining through,
Earth is smiling ‘way out yonder,
Sun so bright it dazzles you;
Birds a-singing, flowers a-flinging
All their fragrance on the breeze;
Dancing shadows, green, still meadows –
Don’t you mope, you’ve still got these.
These, and none can take this from you;
These, and none can weigh their worth.
What! You’re tired and broke and beaten? –
Why, you’re rich – you’re got the earth!
Yes, if you’re a tramp in tatters,
While the blue sky bends above
You’ve got nearly all that matters –
You’ve got God, and God is love.","You’ve struck a heap of trouble – Bust in business, lost your wife","Some poems look to tell a story; others try to convey a feeling; some try to inspire. It isn’t too common (relatively speaking) that a poem will attempt to speak directly to its reader, but when it does, it needs to speak in a certain way so as to be able to reach any reader who happens past it. This can be tricky; after all, each individual person will be experiencing something different at the time of reading. In the case of ‘Comfort’ by Robert Service, the target audience is those who can sympathize with feeling defeated, down, or depressed, and offers an optimistic perspective to combat the feeling. It utilizes many poetic devices typical of Service’s work, as well as taking on a healthy perspective with the intention of connecting with inspiring its reader."

The poem presents the reader with a haunting image of faces from the past. These come up in the unnamed man's mind, reminding him of all those who are lost and what they all experienced together. Despite having survived, his life is troubled and unrestful. These ghost-like images are one of the reasons that this is the case. He asks that they find peace, goes away, and leave him to move on with the mundanities of day-to-day existence. It is not his fault, he says, that he lived and they did not."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is only able to create at certain time periods. These fall during the “still night” when the moon is the only thing commanding the sky. It is also a time when lovers “lie abed” and speak of their grief. The image of the lovers is important and will return in the final lines. He goes on to state that it is not his goal through writing to make a great name for himself. Ambition is not something he is interested in. Nor, he states, is building up his own ego. He writes so that he might express the inner workings of his own heart, and that of others. In the final sets of lines, he goes on to describe who he does and doesn't write for. Those he is interested in speaking to are “lovers” who have true, real lives. They experience joys and upsets. He does not care to write for the dead, or for the “proud man” who might try to control him."

The speaker begins the poem by describing the man looking back at his life and the landscape he grew up in. He's noticing differences in it, such as the mountains, which now appear much taller (perhaps more imposing). He sees his mother in the hills and traces as if looking at a map, the places he knew. The word “fond” is used here, suggesting that he does not hold any animosity towards his home. As the poem progresses, the main character's relationship with his contemporary world grows more complicated. He finds himself set apart in one way or another (some have suggested because he's gay) from everyone else. The poem ends with a striking image of a giantess that has inspired several different interpretations."

It has greyish flecks and blurred lines on it. The print is smeared, and it seems like the photograph was taken a long time ago. But, it is not the case. The speaker makes it clear that the photo was taken the day after she drowned in a lake near her house. This shocking description heightens the tension of this piece. The speaker welcomes readers to look at this photograph and find her if they can."

Thro’ ethereal deeps afar,
Once I watch’d with restless yearning
An alluring, aureate star;
Ev’ry eye aloft returning,
Gleaming nigh the Arctic car.
Mystic waves of beauty blended
With the gorgeous golden rays;
Phantasies of bliss descended
In a myrrh’d Elysian haze;
And in lyre-born chords extended
Harmonies of Lydian lays.
There (thought I) lies scenes of pleasure,
Where the free and blessed dwell,
And each moment bears a treasure
Freighted with a lotus-spell,
And there floats a liquid measure
From the lute of Israfel.

Worlds of happiness unknown,
Peace and Innocence entwining

Purer, fairer, than our own.

Lovecraft is a mystical, otherworldly poem that tells the tale of a misinterpreted golden star and its truly terrible reality. In the first lines of 'Astrophobos', the speaker begins by describing his love for the otherworldly darkness of outer space. He expresses the pleasure he feels when he can stare up at the stars, especially one that's close to Ursa Major. The speaker yearns for this particular star and crafts an entire narrative around it. He interprets it as being a place of joy, virtue, and heavenly music. While celebrating the star and those that live on it a change comes over the scene. The star is suddenly shrouded in crimson and its true nature becomes clear. Now, all he can see is horror and woe. There are demons in the flickering light, staring back at him and all the music is discordant. He feels as though he's been shown the truth of outer space and turns his back on his previous love for stargazing."
1544,1555,1555,"When I had money, money, O!
I knew no joy till I went poor;
For many a false man as a friend
Came knocking all day at my door.

Then felt I like a child that holds
A trumpet that he must not blow
Because a man is dead; I dared
Not speak to let this false world know.

Much have I thought of life, and seen
How poor men's hearts are ever light;
And how their wives do hum like bees
About their work from morn till night.

And see the rich ones coldly frown

So much as rich men should come down.

The poem begins with the narrator lamenting that when he had money, he experienced no joy until he went poor again. This is because the wealth he had only attracted fake friends, and he felt he needed to keep his wealth hidden to keep these kinds of people away. The narrator then states that in his experience, all the “poor” people that he sees are much happier than “rich” people. They have more fulfilling relationships compared to people who have money because money attracts people who seek to gain from it. The narrator then says that rather than try to increase their wealth, rich men should humble themselves so that they can experience the same genuine fulfillment as poor men. The poem ends with the narrator stating that while he now has little money and few friends, the friends he does have are genuine."

Frit by the cowboy as he scrambled down
To reach the misty dewberry—let us stoop
And seek its nest—the brook we need not dread,

Beneath the bunch of grass that spindles rank
Its husk seeds tall and high—'tis rudely planned
Of bleachèd stubbles and the withered fare
That last year's harvest left upon the land,
Lined thinly with the horse's sable hair.

Resembling writing scrawls which fancy reads
As nature's poesy and pastoral spells—
They are the yellowhammer's and she dwells
Most poet-like where brooks and flowery weeds
As sweet as Castaly to fancy seems
And that old molehill like as Parnass' hill
On which her partner haply sits and dreams
O'er all her joys of song—so leave it still
A happy home of sunshine, flowers and streams.
Yet in the sweetest places cometh ill,
A noisome weed that burthens every soil;
For snakes are known with chill and deadly coil
To watch such nests and seize the helpless young,
And like as though the plague became a guest,
Leaving a houseless home, a ruined nest—
And mournful hath the little warblers sung
When such like woes hath rent its little breast.","A bird flew up, a cowboy flew down, a bird flew",'The Yellowhammer's Nest' by John Clare describes the beautiful and brutal world in which the yellowhammer lives. The poem begins with the speaker asking that his listeners come close to a stream and take a look at the nest which is nestled there. It contains beautiful eggs that appear to have “scribbled” ink lines upon them. The second half of the poem describes the beauty of the world of birds and how that beauty will eventually be interrupted by weeds and predators.

My soul steals to a pear-shaped plot of ground,
Where gleamed the lilac-tinted Easter lily
Soft-scented in the air for yards around;

Alone, without a hint of guardian leaf!
Just like a fragile bell of silver rime,
It burst the tomb for freedom sweet and brief
In the young pregnant year at Eastertime;

And many thought it was a sacred sign,
And some called it the resurrection flower;
And I, a pagan, worshiped at its shrine,
Yielding my heart unto its perfumed power.","A lily of spring, gleaming in the air for yards around;","‘The Easter Flower’ by Claude McKay highlights the differences between the speaker’s personal spirituality and the Christian theology surrounding Easter through their reverence of a small but beautiful flower. It is a short poem that centers on the speaker’s admiration of a lilac-colored Easter lily. The first stanza underscores the gulf that exists between the speaker’s understanding of the religious tradition surrounding the holiday itself. Instead, they focus all their attention on a small patch of ground from which a flower grows, the beautiful smell drawing them towards it. The speaker then heavily alludes to the story of Christ’s resurrection, which at first appears to contradict their foreignness to Easter. But then a group of Christians appear beside the speaker and start to revere the same flower as a sign of Christ’s resurrection as well. The speaker, however, worships in much more pagan terms and values the flower simply as a sublime piece of nature."

And winter sternly frowned;
The flaky snow fell thick and fast,
And clad the fields around.
Forced by the storm’s relentless power,
Emboldened by despair,
A shivering redbreast sought my door,

‘Welcome, sweet bird!’ I fondly cried,
‘No danger need’st thou fear,
Secure with me thou may’st abide,
Till warmer suns appear.
‘And when mild spring comes smiling on,
And bids the fields look gay,
Thou, with thy sweet, thy grateful song,
My kindness shalt repay.’

Sweep all our fancied joys away,

The poem begins with the speaker setting the scene with a description of the terrible weather that has blown down from the north. It is incredibly cold and a small bird, a robin redbreast, has appeared at her doorstep. It is seeking out a place of refuge until winter is over. The speaker invites the bird into her home but soon discovers that was a mistake. The bird is spotted by an “envious cat” and killed. The poem concludes with the narrator mourning the death of the bird and contemplating the unfair, unbalanced nature of life."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that everything he has worked on as a poet has come together as a coat. This is a piece of clothing that he spent a great deal of time on. It was covered with “old mythologies,” or stories of past times, which proved untrue, but still worthy of consideration. They stretch from the top to the bottom. In the next section of the text, Yeats describes how his works have been misappropriated. The fools Yeats refers to in the text are likely other poets and other contemporaries, such as politicians. They took his wore, put in their own name, and pretended that they “wrought it.” In conclusion, Yeats declares that it doesn't matter to him in the end. His anger has disappeared and he's chosen to take off his coat and embrace “walking naked.”"

And some words played between us to and fro

Alive enough to have strength to die;
And a grin of bitterness swept thereby

The image of the “pond edged with grayish leaves” displays the speaker's mental state. This poem by Thomas Hardy is characteristic of typical poems by this author in many ways. First, the speaker in the poem has a sarcastic and cynical view of love and relationships, which is not uncommon in Hardy's poetry. Second, he mentions God but also gives the readers the idea that God is distant and cold. This is yet another aspect of Neutral Tones that characterizes it as one of Hardy's poems. The speaker in this poem seems to be a person who has given his heart and soul to a person who has left him bitter, feeling used and wronged. The poetic persona of this piece is a reflection of Hardy, in his cynical feelings toward love."

She loves him with all of her beings, and she hopes God will grant her the ability to love him even after she has passed."

The poem begins with the speaker asking for peace and happiness through nature, but, isn't sure if he's going to get it. He feels as though he needs to ask God if it is possible, this request takes the form of a prayer (as the title alludes to). Otherwise, he's going to be worried about the “uncertain harvest,” and that's not what he wants to do. Frost's speaker is asking on the behalf of everyone around him, and perhaps all of humankind. He goes on to ask that the world is given “pleasure in the orchid white”.These are the flowers that bloom before the fruit. Everyone should be able to see them and appreciate them without thinking about the fruits to come. He also mentions bees and birds, particularly hummingbirds. These are other elements of the landscape he wants to take pleasure in. Although there is a lot about the world that he is unsure of, the elements which only God understands, he knows that spring is accessible to everyone. He'd like it to be a peaceful, clear-headed time that everyone can enjoy."

Yeats elaborates on the role played by Art in bringing about happiness and joy despite the chaotic situations that could prevail around people or caused by any external forces. 'Lapis Lazuli' has its origin in the gift of a large piece of Lapis Lazuli carved by some Chinese sculptor into the semblance of a mountain with temples, trees, paths, and an ascetic and his pupil about to climb the mountain. The poet meditates over the constant pressure on human society to renew and regenerate. As the new generation comes into action the artists have the responsibility to provide what is needed in the future. The poet talks about Art, which plays an important role when the world is hysterical about war and its consequences. On the whole, the speaker of the poem, the poet is examining the possibility of harmony and serenity despite a chaotic environment."

Written by WWI combatant Wilfred Owen while recovering from the trauma of battle, the poem makes a clear statement: war is a hellish and futile waste of human life. It is, then, a kind of protest poem—subverting the usual use of “anthem” as a symbol of nationalism (that is, taking undue pride in your home nation) into an anti-war message."

These ghosts are the embodiment of humankind's worst fears and travel freely from place to place all throughout the night. They have crept out from their “caves” of the mind to haunt one in real life for the first time. The speaker states that the men to whom all of this occurs try any number of things to ward off the ghosts. Some of them turn to prayer, but that does not seem to work as the ghosts continue to “trespass.” The final section describes how in these moments reason is abandoned. No matter what humankind does or the horrors which befall its people, the Earth will always shield itself from these creatures by allowing the sun to rise. The ghosts are only able to wander freely at night and the sun drives them off."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that nothing “unusual” was happening in her town. This changed very quickly though as a horse came down the street from a camp. It was moved slowly, but powerfully. So much so that it made the speaker apprehensive. As the poem progresses, and the horse does a little damage to the speaker's flowers, it becomes a symbol. The horse represents a conflict or the rumor of conflict. As the animal moves down the street everyone has the same reaction. They're too scared to confront it head-on and close their blinds. From the speaker's tone and the poet's used irony, it becomes clear that she does not believe what she has been professing. In reality, she is not so careless with her thoughts and actions. The poet does not believe one should be a passive onlooker in times of strife or ignore the loss of the rose. To do so would be a betrayal."

The poem begins with a description of Buffalo Bill riding his silver stallion as depicted in popular Bill representations. According to the speaker, he is defunct, not of use anymore. Once he used to ride his stallion and hunt pigeons. Similarly, Jesus was once alive, handsome, and in his full powers. All the speaker seeks to know is how Jesus liked his “blue-eyed boy,” Mr. Death, which is a personified representation of the abstract idea."

In the poem's eleven lines the speaker describes through vivid imagery, the dreams that children share with the angels, the violence of the wind against curtains, and the mundanity of day to day city life. In the last line, the speaker brings themselves into the poem, addressing their position, how they wake up, and how they consider the rest of the world."
1558,1569,1569,"Yes when the dark withdrew I suffered light And saw the candles heave beneath the wax,
I watched the shadow of my old self dwindle
As softly on my recollection stole
A mood the senses could not touch or damage,
A sense of peace beyond the breathing word.

Day dawdled at my elbow. It was night
Within. I saw my hands, their soft dark backs
Keeping me from the noise outside. The candle
Seemed snuffed into a deep and silent pool:
It drew no shadow round my constant image
For in a dazzling dark my spirit stirred.

But still I questioned it. My inward sight
Still knew the senses and the senses' tracks,
I felt my flesh and clothes, a rubbing sandal,
And distant voices wishing to console.
My mind was keen to understand and rummage
To find assurance in the sounds I heard.

Then senses ceased and thoughts were driven quite
Away (no act of mine). I could relax
And feel a fire no earnest prayer can kindle;
Old parts of peace dissolved into a whole
And like a bright thing proud in its new plumage
My mind was keen as an attentive bird.

Yes fire, light, air, birds, wax, the sun's own height
I draw from now, but every image breaks.
Only a child's simplicity can handle
Such moments when the hottest fire feels cool,
And every breath is like a sudden homage
To peace that penetrates and is not feared.","A mood the senses could not touch or damage, A sense of peace beyond the breathing wor",Form and Tone 'A World Of Light' is written in free verse. It appears in five stanzas each one containing six lines. The poem is very creative in its use of rhyme. Although within each stanza there is no rhyming pattern. The first line of each stanza rhymes with one another. This is the case for all six lines of each stanza. Although the rhymes aren't always perfect and are sometimes just half-rhymes. The poem is full of imagery and describes a very powerful feeling we presume in the young life of the poet.

Had not yet tanned you into old-boat brown,
When you were not quite thirty and had not begun
To be embittered like the rest, nor grown
obsessed with death, then would you come
Hot with continence upon the sea
Chaste as a gull flying pointed home,
In haste to be with me!

Now that, being dead, you are beyond detection.
And I need not be discreet, let us confess.
It was not love that married us no affection,
But elders' persuasion, not even loneliness,
Recall how first you were so impatient and afraid,
My eyes were open in the dark unlike in love,
Trembling, lest in fear, you'll let me go a maid,
Trembling on the other hand for my virginity.

Three months the monsoon thrashed the sea, and you
Remained at home; the sky cracked like a shell
In thunder, the rain broke through,
At last when the pouring ceased the storm winds fell,
When gulls returned new plumed and wild,
When in our wind torn flamboyant
New buds broke, I was with child.

My face was wan while telling you and voice fell low
And you seemed full of guilt and not to know
Whether to repent or rejoice over the situation
You nodded at the ground and went to sea.
But soon I was to you more than God or temptation.
And so were you to me.

Men come and go, some say they understand.
Our children weep, the youngest thinks you're fast asleep.
There is fear and wonderment.
You had grown so familiar as my hand,
That I cannot with simple grief
Assuage dismemberment.

Tree that it used to nurse;
Once more the flamboyant is torn,
The sky cracks like a shell again.

The poem/story is told from the perspective of the wife. The speaker walks the reader through the beginning of their marriage, how at first it was loveless and arranged by their families but it soon turned passionate. The wife becomes pregnant after a long monsoon keeps the fisherman home for three months. The speaker continues telling the story of their lives together by highlighting their reactions to finding out about the coming child. She describes her fear of telling him and his unease at the news. He was soon to cherish her and she became “more than God or temptation” to him. The poem then reaches the beginning of the end and the speaker goes back to describing the impact the loss of her husband has had on her and her children. The youngest believes he is just sleeping and the others weep for him. The wife is experiencing another dramatic overhaul of her life while those around her attempt to comfort her and see to the mundane details of life. Once more her life is made new, represented by the raging of a new storm."

When the poem begins the speaker gives examples of her partner taking the lead in everyday activities. Atwood gives examples that are more abstract, as well as more physically recognizable. She includes “holding the log / while he sawed it.” As well as sitting in the back of the car, or boat, while he “drove, steered, paddled.” Atwood's speaker continues on to describe how, while she was not in control of the direction of her life, she would focus on individual details, the “minutiae” of the situation. Such as the sewing on the car seats, or the loam clay on the ground. She then goes on to compare the actions they take while together, him pointing, her looking, and taking turns whistling, as the actions of animals following one another. The poem concludes with the speaker questioning why experiences look “sunnier” than they actually were. How perhaps she was happier then, being bored, like “dogs or groundhogs,” and how if she went back to those times she would no longer be bored. She would want to know, and know everything."

Throughout this poem, the speaker poses several different scenarios about what’s going to happen after he dies. He is less interested in the afterlife than he is in the way that those still living will continue on with their lives. Hardy’s speaker poses a number of questions about the world, wondering if his friends will remember him in a favorable light. Will they, he wonders, recall his kind nature, care for the earth, and frequent contemplations of the night sky?

1563,1574,1574,"Well, so that is that. Now we must dismantle the tree,
Putting the decorations back into their cardboard boxes --
Some have got broken -- and carrying them up to the attic.
The holly and the mistletoe must be taken down and burnt,
And the children got ready for school. There are enough
Left-overs to do, warmed-up, for the rest of the week --
Not that we have much appetite, having drunk such a lot,
Stayed up so late, attempted -- quite unsuccessfully --
To love all of our relatives, and in general
Grossly overestimated our powers. Once again
As in previous years we have seen the actual Vision and failed
To do more than entertain it as an agreeable
Possibility, once again we have sent Him away,
Begging though to remain His disobedient servant,
The promising child who cannot keep His word for long.
The Christmas Feast is already a fading memory,
And already the mind begins to be vaguely aware
Of an unpleasant whiff of apprehension at the thought
Of Lent and Good Friday which cannot, after all, now
Be very far off. But, for the time being, here we all are,
Back in the moderate Aristotelian city
Of darning and the Eight-Fifteen, where Euclid's geometry
And Newton's mechanics would account for our experience,
And the kitchen table exists because I scrub it.
It seems to have shrunk during the holidays. The streets
Are much narrower than we remembered; we had forgotten
The office was as depressing as this. To those who have seen
The Child, however dimly, however incredulously,
The Time Being is, in a sense, the most trying time of all.
For the innocent children who whispered so excitedly
Outside the locked door where they knew the presents to be
Grew up when it opened. Now, recollecting that moment
We can repress the joy, but the guilt remains conscious;
Remembering the stable where for once in our lives
Everything became a You and nothing was an It.
And craving the sensation but ignoring the cause,
We look round for something, no matter what, to inhibit
Our self-reflection, and the obvious thing for that purpose
Would be some great suffering. So, once we have met the Son,
We are tempted ever after to pray to the Father;
""Lead us into temptation and evil for our sake.""
They will come, all right, don't worry; probably in a form
That we do not expect, and certainly with a force
More dreadful than we can imagine. In the meantime
There are bills to be paid, machines to keep in repair,
Irregular verbs to learn, the Time Being to redeem
From insignificance. The happy morning is over,
The night of agony still to come; the time is noon:
When the Spirit must practice his scales of rejoicing
Without even a hostile audience, and the Soul endure
A silence that is neither for nor against her faith
That God's Will will be done, That, in spite of her prayers,
God will cheat no one, not even the world of its triumph.","The Christmas Feast is already a fading memory, and already the mind begins to be","In this section of 'For the Time Being' by W.H.

The poem uses vivid imagery to depict the dismantling of the Christmas tree and the state of everyone's religiosity. During the Christmas season, everyone tried their best to love their family members and devote themselves to God. But, as one gets farther away from that time things change. The world returns to normal and everything becomes redefined by reason."

He takes scary events and makes them lighter and easier to understand. The Stone Age becomes the Gravel Age and the Spanish Inquisition a period in which people couldn't stop asking questions. But, this choice on the teacher's part has an impact on the students that he didn't expect. Since they aren't taught about history's mistakes they repeat those same mistakes in the form of cruelty and bullying outside the school. Yet, the teacher continues in the same mindset, contemplating changing the Boer War to a war of boring stories."

As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of the best
For sacrifice, heaping the pyre with goods,

Souls out of Erebus, cadaverous dead, of brides
Of youths and of the old who had borne much;
Souls stained with recent tears, girls tender,
Men many, mauled with bronze lance heads,
Battle spoil, bearing yet dreory arms,
These many crowded about me; with shouting,
Pallor upon me, cried to my men for more beasts;
Slaughtered the herds, sheep slain of bronze;
Poured ointment, cried to the gods,
To Pluto the strong, and praised Proserpine;
Unsheathed the narrow sword,
I sat to keep off the impetuous impotent dead,
Till I should hear Tiresias.

Unburied, cast on the wide earth,
Limbs that we left in the house of Circe,
Unwept, unwrapped in sepulchre, since toils urged other.

There, he seeks out information about what's going to happen in the next part of his journey. In the underworld, Odysseus runs into one of his friends who died on Circe's island, Eplenor.

In this poem, Housman's poetic persona gazes at the green buds on the elm tree, perhaps during spring as they bloom. He watches the green buds “sprinkle the lime like rain” and gets lost in wishful thinking about his own life. Further, he imagines himself walking by the hedgerow bowers and examining the leaves. He wants to refocus and concentrate on the little things in life that he often took for granted. Things that would make him forget about the uncertainties and melancholy of daily life."

In a poem with only a loose structure and faint rhyme, it tells a cryptic story that focuses more on moment-to-moment feeling and passion above all. It is an unusual way to tell a story, but an effective one, one that stands best on its own, and speaks for itself, asking and answering difficult, but important questions about the nature of friendship."

The poem begins with the speaker addressing his listener and telling this person that it might be his “portion” in life never to know them. The identity of the listener remains a mystery throughout the piece but the speaker's emotions are made very clear. He is desperate to maintain his feelings of loss throughout the rest of his life. The poem presents a number of scenarios in which he expresses this intention. No matter if he is on the side of a dirty road or celebrating with friends, he must remember what happened in the past. There is an obsessive quality to the text that is seen most clearly through the repetition of the last three lines of each stanza. The speaker's refrain follows a reader as they make their way from the beginning to the end of the poem. One is unable to get away from the lines, just as the speaker is unable to escape his own thoughts."

In each stanza of this piece, Welch shows what different individuals do on Christmas. It is just another day of their lives, filled with poverty, hopelessness, and grief. The wise men brought candles on credit for the day. While the warriors indulged in excessive drinking, trying to forget the good old days. Furthermore, Welch describes how others kept themselves busy in their usual way of living. In totality, he draws a picture of a landscape that is devoid of festivity or joy, in stark contrast with the essence of Christmas."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that there was a knight who had spent his whole life journeying through “sunshine and …shadow.” He was seeking out the lost paradise city of Eldorado, rumored to contain endless amounts of gold. Although he searched for years and years, the knight never found the city. In the middle of the poem, the speaker describes how the knight's strength was starting to fail him. He was becoming quite old and was about to die. This is when he encounters a shade along the road. This person, or perhaps a ghost of the afterlife, told him that one can only reach Eldorado through death. It requires walking in lands such as the “valley of the shadow of death” from the Bible."
1573,1584,1584,"Old Man, or Lad's-love,—in the name there's nothing
To one that knows not Lad's-love, or Old Man,
The hoar-green feathery herb, almost a tree,
Growing with rosemary and lavender.
Even to one that knows it well, the names
Half decorate, half perplex, the thing it is:
At least, what that is clings not to the names
In spite of time. And yet I like the names.
The herb itself I like not, but for certain
I love it, as some day the child will love it
Who plucks a feather from the door-side bush
Whenever she goes in or out of the house.
Often she waits there, snipping the tips and shrivelling
The shreds at last on to the path, perhaps
Thinking, perhaps of nothing, till she sniffs
Her fingers and runs off. The bush is still
But half as tall as she, though it is as old;
So well she clips it. Not a word she says;
And I can only wonder how much hereafter
She will remember, with that bitter scent,
Of garden rows, and ancient damson-trees
Topping a hedge, a bent path to a door,
A low thick bush beside the door, and me
Forbidding her to pick.
As for myself,
Where first I met the bitter scent is lost.
I, too, often shrivel the grey shreds,
Sniff them and think and sniff again and try
Once more to think what it is I am remembering,
Always in vain. I cannot like the scent,
Yet I would rather give up others more sweet,
With no meaning, than this bitter one.
I have mislaid the key. I sniff the spray
And think of nothing; I see and I hear nothing;
Yet seem, too, to be listening, lying in wait
For what I should, yet never can, remember:
No garden appears, no path, no hoar-green bush
Of Lad's-love, or Old Man, no child beside,
Neither father nor mother, nor any playmate;
Only an avenue, dark, nameless, without end.","The hoar-green feathery herb, almost a tree, grows with rosemary and lavender","'Old Man' by Edward Thomas is a thoughtful poem that describes a speaker's contrasting views and memories of a specific plant. The first part of the poem is dedicated to a description of the plant and a discussion of its name. It is called both “old man” and “lad's-love.” These juxtaposed names are symbolic of the speaker's confused opinion. He likes the plant and its smell but doesn't actually enjoy it. He brings in images of his daughter and her experiences with the feathery herb. This leads to a discussion of his own memories of the plant and how, despite his best attempts, he can't remember the connection he has with the plant from his youth. When he tries to dig into his memory, there's nothing there except “an avenue, dark, nameless, without end.”"

In the first lines of 'Bonedog,' the speaker begins by stating that arriving home from anywhere can be painful, even if home was where “you” wanted to be all day. It's the same thing every day. “You” get up and do the same things, see the same people, and think about the future. The poem ends when the poet considers what it would be like to see through everything to the “bone.”"

The speaker is unable to sleep, so he invites sleep as if inviting a person, using all kinds of flattery. He praises sleep for all is quality, and for being an unbiased leveler who goes without minding whether rich or poor. Sydney explains sleep to a land of peace and tries to find peace and solace. Further, he describes sleep as a place of escape from the noise, light, and everything that make men weary. Finally, he concludes stating that sleep is livelier than reality, for he (Astrophel) can see Stella clearly."

The speaker, in a wayward manner, hits the flattened tires with a rod. At this point, it is not clear what is running in his mind. His mother calls him in and so does his grandfather for helping them in their work. In the second stanza, the speaker acts like a sociopath. He hits his grandfather with the rod and finally kills him and his mother with a rifle. Then he hunts for his sister. Finally, he picks up his grandfather's belongings and leaves his home, heading nowhere."

Through this piece, Benedetti presents four states of human life. The first and the last stage are permanent. While the middle stages are dynamic and concepts impregnated in the mind get changed. To clarify, the first stage is childhood and the last is old-age. Whereas, the youth is the second step. Thereafter, comes the time of marriage or middle-age. In all of these stages, a person sees death differently. It is not limited to this only. The person also loses the ability to visualize the greatness of simplicity."

The poem takes the reader through the speaker's perspective of Liberty and its children. These children have some redeeming features, as the next lines discuss, but they are not entirely pleasing to the speaker. He can't say that he loves them. Despite this, he does appreciate their passion. This is the same passion that he can find in his own placid soul. It makes him think about how the world would be different if men and women did not feel a connection to Liberty. 'Sonnet to Liberty' concludes with the speaker acknowledging the men and women who sacrifice themselves for a good cause as “Christs”. But, he still can't totally dedicate himself in the same way."

The speaker emphasizes the way that all the sounds of the woods come together to make a concert that is perceptible to human ears, if one is listening. In the next lines he introduces the rainbow, a brilliant “bow” that is striking and ethereal. He brings in Isaac Newton, who made the science of colour what it is today.

Fuller depicts the image of a bat flying around the house. This creature makes the external atmosphere so eerie that it makes even the moon astonished. The last stanza of the poem contains a repetition of the first two lines as readers can see in other cradle songs. Through this stanza, the speaker blesses the child again and lulls it to sleep."

In that case, his soul could have broken out of the thick web of her hair in which it would have got entangled. But in the case of this particular woman, he cannot help becoming her slave because she has the skill to forge fetters for him from the very air which he breathes. The poet feels that it would have been easy for him to fight a battle against this woman if he had met her on level ground and equal terms because in that case, the chances of victory would have been equal for both the contestants. However, in the present case, he finds all his resistance against her futile because she has a double advantage – the advantage of bright eyes and the advantage of a musical voice. He is sure to be defeated in this contest because with her voice she can sweep him off his feet, and with her eyes, she can dazzle him."

Her own experiences make it very likely that she is the narrator of the poem. This is particularly notable within the second and third verses (after the first “equality and I will be free”), where Angelou is more than likely discussing her years working as a prostitute and table dancer, among other similar jobs. Angelou joined this industry, largely illegally, to care for her newborn son while fighting against racism in society — this is likely a sliver of the meaning behind “could you ever understand?” in that verse. It is clear that this is a deeply personal piece for its author, and is designed to resonate strongly with the reader by bringing them into Angelou’s own world, just for long enough to understand what it is she spent her life fighting for as best as she could."

1588,1599,1599,"I Pain

At my wits’ end
And all resources gone, I lay here,
All of my body tense to the touch of fear,
And my mind,

Muffled now as if the nerves
Refused any longer to let thoughts form,
Is no longer a safe retreat, a tidy home,
No longer serves

My body’s demands or shields
With fine words, as it once would daily,
My storehouse of dread. Now, slowly,
My heart, hand, whole body yield

To fear. Bed, ward, window begin
To lose their solidity. Faces no longer
Look kind or needed; yet I still fight the stronger
Terror – oblivion – the needle thrusts in.

II The Ward

One with the photographs of grandchildren,
Another with discussion of disease,

Another with the memory of her garden,
Another with her marriage – all of these

Keep death at bay by building round their illness
A past they never honoured at the time.

The sun streams through the window, the earth heaves
Gently for this new season. Blossoms climb

Out on the healthy world where no one thinks
Of pain. Nor would these patients wish them to;

The great preservers here are little things –
The dream last night, a photograph, a view.

III After an Operation
What to say first? I learnt I was afraid,
Not frightened in the way I had been
When wide awake and well, I simply mean
Fear became absolute and I became
Subject to it; it beckoned, I obeyed.

Fear which before had been particular,
Attached to this or that scene, word, event,
Here became general. Past, future meant
Nothing. Only the present moment bore
This huge, vague fear, this wish for nothing more.

Yet life still stirred and nerves themselves became
Like shoots which hurt while growing, sensitive
To find not death but further ways to live.
And now I’m convalescent, fear can claim
No general power. Yet I am not the same.

IV Patients in a Public Ward

Like children now, bed close to bed,
With flowers set up where toys would be
In real childhoods, secretly
We cherish each our own disease,
And when we talk we talk to please
Ourselves that still we are not dead.

All is kept safe – the healthy world
Held at a distance, on a rope.
Where human things like hate and hope
Persist. The world we know is full
Of things we need, unbeautiful
And yet desired – a glass to hold

And sip, a cube of ice, a pill
To help us sleep. Yet in this warm
And sealed-off nest, the least alarm
Speaks clear of death. Our fears grow wide;
There are no places left to hide
And no more peace in lying still.

Infermiere in una vecchia stanza di ospedaleV The Visitors

They visit me and I attempt to keep
A social smile upon my face. Even here
Some ceremony is required, no deep
Relationship, simply a way to clear
Emotion to one side; the fear
I felt last night is buried in drugged sleep.

They come and all their kindness makes me want
To cry (they say the sick weep easily).
When they have gone I shall be limp and faint,
My heart will thump and stumble crazily;
Yet through my illness I can see
One wish stand clear no pain, no fear can taint.

Your absence has been stronger than all pain
And I am glad to find that when most weak
Always my mind returned to you again.
Through all the noisy nights when, harsh awake, I longed for day and light to break –
In that sick desert, you were life, were rain.

VI Hospital

Observe the hours which seem to stand
Between these beds and pause until
A shriek breaks through the time to show
That humankind is suffering still.

Observe the tall and shrivelled flowers,
So brave a moment to the glance.
The fevered eyes stare through the hours
And petals fall with soft foot-prints.

A world where silence has no hold
Except a tentative small grip.
Limp hands upon the blankets fold,
Minds from their bodies slowly slip.

Though death is never talked of here,
It is more palpable and felt –
Touching the cheek or in a tear –
By being present by default.

The muffled cries, the curtains drawn,
The flowers pale before they fall –
The world itself is here brought down
To what is suffering and small.

The huge philosophies depart,
Large words slink off, like faith, like love,
The thumping of the human heart
Is reassurance here enough.

Only one dreamer going back
To how he felt when he was well,
Weeps under pillows at his lack
But cannot tell, but cannot tell.

VII For a Woman with a Fatal Illness

The verdict has been given and you lie quietly
Beyond hope, hate, revenge, even self-pity.

You accept gratefully the gifts – flowers, fruit –
Clumsily offered now that your visitors too

Know you must certainly die in a matter of months,
They are dumb now, reduced only to gestures,

Helpless before your news, perhaps hating
You because you are the cause of their unease.

I, too, watching from my temporary corner,
Feel impotent and wish for something violent –

Whether as sympathy only, I am not sure –
But something at least to break the terrible tension.

Death has no right to come so quietly.

VIII Patients

Violence does not terrify.
Storms here would be a relief,
Lightning be a companion to grief.
It is the helplessness, the way they lie

Beyond hope, fear, love,
That makes me afraid. I would like to shout,
Crash my voice into the silence, flout
The passive suffering here. They move

Only in pain, their bodies no longer seem
Dependent on blood, muscle, bone.
It is as if air alone
Kept them alive, or else a mere whim

On the part of instrument, surgeon, nurse.
I too am one of them, but well enough
To long for some simple sign of life,
Or to imagine myself getting worse.","I Pain At my wits’ end And all resources gone, I lay here, All","Sequence in a Hospital' by Elizabeth Jennings speaks on the hopes, fears, and routines that develop during a long stay at a hospital. This sequence of events begins with a speaker who has lost all hope. She is in bed experiencing the loss of control over her own body and over her mind's ability to hide the truth of her situation from her. Still, she fights, as this one spec of reality that she is able to still perceive is better than the “oblivion” of the needle. The people of the hospital do many things in an attempt to block their minds from the truth of their sickness. They look at photos, the view, and even discuss the disease until it has no meaning. 'Sequence in a Hospital' travels to the bedside of a woman who has just received surgery. She tells of her all-encompassing fear before the procedure and how it was not attached to any one moment or action but rather to the general present. She is recovering now, but she is not the same. 'Sequence in a Hospital' then moves on to speak on the people of the “Ward” who are like children stuffed into bed together. The rooms are cramped but instead of being filled with toys, they are littered with flowers. There are visitors that come to the hospital and the speaker describes how when they visit her she puts on a “social smile” to greet them. She must pretend and then use the strength she gains from them later when she needs it the most. The hospital in its silent hours is not truly silent. There are the movements of the patients, the slipping of their minds, and the suffering of “humankind.” Death can be heard and seen everywhere, although it is not talked about. The poem begins to conclude with the thoughts of a dying woman who is hated by her visitors for causing them unease, and the thoughts of a narrator who sees these tense moments and wants to break them. The final stanzas describe this narrator's desire to either become part of the hospital or to break all the patients free of their unbearable stillness."
1589,1600,1600,"""Courage!"" he said, and pointed toward the land,
""This mounting wave will roll us shoreward soon.""
In the afternoon they came unto a land
In which it seemed always afternoon.
All round the coast the languid air did swoon,
Breathing like one that hath a weary dream.
Full-faced above the valley stood the moon;
And like a downward smoke, the slender stream
Along the cliff to fall and pause and fall did seem.
A land of streams! some, like a downward smoke,
Slow-dropping veils of thinnest lawn, did go;
And some thro' wavering lights and shadows broke,
Rolling a slumbrous sheet of foam below.
They saw the gleaming river seaward flow
From the inner land: far off, three mountain-tops,
Three silent pinnacles of aged snow,
Stood sunset-flush'd: and, dew'd with showery drops,
Up-clomb the shadowy pine above the woven copse.
The charmed sunset linger'd low adown
In the red West: thro' mountain clefts the dale
Was seen far inland, and the yellow down
Border'd with palm, and many a winding vale
And meadow, set with slender galingale;
A land where all things always seem'd the same!
And round about the keel with faces pale,
Dark faces pale against that rosy flame,
The mild-eyed melancholy Lotos-eaters came.
Branches they bore of that enchanted stem,
Laden with flower and fruit, whereof they gave
To each, but whoso did receive of them,
And taste, to him the gushing of the wave
Far far away did seem to mourn and rave
On alien shores; and if his fellow spake,
His voice was thin, as voices from the grave;
And deep-asleep he seem'd, yet all awake,
And music in his ears his beating heart did make.
They sat them down upon the yellow sand,
Between the sun and moon upon the shore;
And sweet it was to dream of Fatherland,
Of child, and wife, and slave; but evermore
Most weary seem'd the sea, weary the oar,
Weary the wandering fields of barren foam.
Then some one said, ""We will return no more"";
And all at once they sang, ""Our island home
Is far beyond the wave; we will no longer roam.""
There is sweet music here that softer falls
Than petals from blown roses on the grass,
Or night-dews on still waters between walls
Of shadowy granite, in a gleaming pass;
Music that gentlier on the spirit lies,
Than tir'd eyelids upon tir'd eyes;
Music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies.
Here are cool mosses deep,
And thro' the moss the ivies creep,
And in the stream the long-leaved flowers weep,
And from the craggy ledge the poppy hangs in sleep.""
Why are we weigh'd upon with heaviness,
And utterly consumed with sharp distress,
While all things else have rest from weariness?
All things have rest: why should we toil alone,
We only toil, who are the first of things,
And make perpetual moan,
Still from one sorrow to another thrown:
Nor ever fold our wings,
And cease from wanderings,
Nor steep our brows in slumber's holy balm;
Nor harken what the inner spirit sings,
""There is no joy but calm!""
Why should we only toil, the roof and crown of things?
Lo! in the middle of the wood,
The folded leaf is woo'd from out the bud
With winds upon the branch, and there
Grows green and broad, and takes no care,
Sun-steep'd at noon, and in the moon
Nightly dew-fed; and turning yellow
Falls, and floats adown the air.
Lo! sweeten'd with the summer light,
The full-juiced apple, waxing over-mellow,
Drops in a silent autumn night.
All its allotted length of days
The flower ripens in its place,
Ripens and fades, and falls, and hath no toil,
Fast-rooted in the fruitful soil.
Hateful is the dark-blue sky,
Vaulted o'er the dark-blue sea.
Death is the end of life; ah, why
Should life all labour be?
Let us alone. Time driveth onward fast,
And in a little while our lips are dumb.
Let us alone. What is it that will last?
All things are taken from us, and become
Portions and parcels of the dreadful past.
Let us alone. What pleasure can we have
To war with evil? Is there any peace
In ever climbing up the climbing wave?
All things have rest, and ripen toward the grave
In silence; ripen, fall and cease:
Give us long rest or death, dark death, or dreamful ease.
How sweet it were, hearing the downward stream,
With half-shut eyes ever to seem
Falling asleep in a half-dream!
To dream and dream, like yonder amber light,
Which will not leave the myrrh-bush on the height;
To hear each other's whisper'd speech;
Eating the Lotos day by day,
To watch the crisping ripples on the beach,
And tender curving lines of creamy spray;
To lend our hearts and spirits wholly
To the influence of mild-minded melancholy;
To muse and brood and live again in memory,
With those old faces of our infancy
Heap'd over with a mound of grass,
Two handfuls of white dust, shut in an urn of brass!
Dear is the memory of our wedded lives,
And dear the last embraces of our wives
And their warm tears: but all hath suffer'd change:
For surely now our household hearths are cold,
Our sons inherit us: our looks are strange:
And we should come like ghosts to trouble joy.
Or else the island princes over-bold
Have eat our substance, and the minstrel sings
Before them of the ten years' war in Troy,
And our great deeds, as half-forgotten things.
Is there confusion in the little isle?
Let what is broken so remain.
The Gods are hard to reconcile:
'Tis hard to settle order once again.
There is confusion worse than death,
Trouble on trouble, pain on pain,
Long labour unto aged breath,
Sore task to hearts worn out by many wars
And eyes grown dim with gazing on the pilot-stars.
But, propt on beds of amaranth and moly,
How sweet (while warm airs lull us, blowing lowly)
With half-dropt eyelid still,
Beneath a heaven dark and holy,
To watch the long bright river drawing slowly
His waters from the purple hill—
To hear the dewy echoes calling
From cave to cave thro' the thick-twined vine—
To watch the emerald-colour'd water falling
Thro' many a wov'n acanthus-wreath divine!
Only to hear and see the far-off sparkling brine,
Only to hear were sweet, stretch'd out beneath the pine.
The Lotos blooms below the barren peak:
The Lotos blows by every winding creek:
All day the wind breathes low with mellower tone:
Thro' every hollow cave and alley lone
Round and round the spicy downs the yellow Lotos-dust is blown.
We have had enough of action, and of motion we,
Roll'd to starboard, roll'd to larboard, when the surge was seething free,
Where the wallowing monster spouted his foam-fountains in the sea.
Let us swear an oath, and keep it with an equal mind,
In the hollow Lotos-land to live and lie reclined
On the hills like Gods together, careless of mankind.
For they lie beside their nectar, and the bolts are hurl'd
Far below them in the valleys, and the clouds are lightly curl'd
Round their golden houses, girdled with the gleaming world:
Where they smile in secret, looking over wasted lands,
Blight and famine, plague and earthquake, roaring deeps and fiery sands,
Clanging fights, and flaming towns, and sinking ships, and praying hands.
But they smile, they find a music centred in a doleful song
Steaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong,
Like a tale of little meaning tho' the words are strong;
Chanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave the soil,
Sow the seed, and reap the harvest with enduring toil,
Storing yearly little dues of wheat, and wine and oil;
Till they perish and they suffer—some, 'tis whisper'd—down in hell
Suffer endless anguish, others in Elysian valleys dwell,
Resting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel.
Surely, surely, slumber is more sweet than toil, the shore
Than labour in the deep mid-ocean, wind and wave and oar;
O, rest ye, brother mariners, we will not wander more.","The sea was a gleaming haze, and the sun was ","Tennyson's 'The Lotos-eaters' is based on a portion of Homer's Odyssey in which Odysseus's men are fed lotos plants and become mesmerized by the land onto which they have stumbled. The poem begins with Odysseus commanding his men to have “Courage.” They will soon find a shorn on which to land. They do so almost immediately and it enchants them with it's otherworldly beauty. There are valleys, snowy mountains, and cliffs that are covered in streams. While the men are looking at their surrounding the “Lotos-eaters” appear and deliver to the men branches covered in lotos flowers and fruits. The men who eat these fruits, all but Odysseus, fall under the empty spell of the land. They believe that they no longer want to continue their quest homeward and would rather stay there where they do not have to worry about making their way back to the “Fatherland.” The second half of the poem is made up of a “Choric Song” in which the men describe all the reasons that they want to remain on the island. They do not think that it is fair that they should have to labor their whole lives while no other being is forced into the same fate. As humans, this is what their lives consist of and they no longer want to take part. They confess that what they want most is a life in which they relax until their death. They want to live as a leaf does, simply existing and then dying when it is their time. Instead, the men state, they are head towards death through a life that is nothing but misery. They would rather die now than have to work their whole lives. The men do make sure to mention their wives and the homes they are abandoning. But they believe that their families will be better off without them by this point. Life has moved on and their return would only cause more problems. They are content to live as they believe the Gods do. They will lay in their fields of lotos, as the Gods do in their valleys of asphodel, and look out on human misery. They will make no effort to intervene or help. The poem concludes with the men stating once more, reassuring one another, that their wanders are truly finished."
1590,1601,1601,"Down the close, darkening lanes they sang their way
To the siding-shed,
And lined the train with faces grimly gay.
 
Their breasts were stuck all white with wreath and spray
As men's are, dead.
 
Dull porters watched them, and a casual tramp
Stood staring hard,
Sorry to miss them from the upland camp.
Then, unmoved, signals nodded, and a lamp
Winked to the guard.
 
So secretly, like wrongs hushed-up, they went.
They were not ours:
We never heard to which front these were sent.
 
Nor there if they yet mock what women meant
Who gave them flowers.
 
Shall they return to beatings of great bells
In wild trainloads?

May creep back, silent, to still village wells
Up half-known roads.",The train was a scream of a scream of a s,"‘The Send-Off’ is an anti-war poem and is atypically dark, which was a trademark of Wilfred Owen’s poetry. The Send-Off is presented in four stanzas each of which is five lines long. Rhyme features heavily throughout the poem which has an ABAAB pattern and interestingly all of the “B-rhymes” are shorter lines. The rhyme pattern mixed with the sombre nature of The Send-Off gives it an almost jarring quality. I think this is deliberate to emphasize the futility in the hope of the people taken their loved ones to the station before they are shipped off to war. It is told in the first person, passively. But actively addresses the reader in the final stanza which gives a very dramatic effect."

I thought I'd keep it as a pet
And let it sleep with me.
I made it some pajamas
And a pillow for its head.
Then last night it ran away,
But first it wet the bed.",I made myself a snowball as perfect as could be. I thought I'd kee,"'Snowball' by Shel Silverstein briefly tells of a child's adventures with a perfect snowball and the consequences of bringing it inside. The poem begins with the speaker describing how on one perfect day he went outside and made a snowball. Everything turned out right. This is not an easy task, but he accomplished it. It was “perfect” and he had no intention of throwing it away or giving it up. Rather than leaving it outside or throwing it, as a child might normally do, this speaker decided to take it inside and try to keep it. The fact that it is going to melt does not seem to cross his mind during the decision making process. He is determined to prolong his happiness and believes he will be able to. Once inside the child makes “pajamas” for the snowball as well as a pillow. He treats it as he would a friend or a pet. It also gets to sleep in bed with him. Everything was still going okay, that is, until the morning when he wakes up and interprets the snowball's absence as a sign it ran away."
1592,1603,1603,"“With sandalwood powder and turmeric,

and I will remove all traces of faint praise devastating. “",I prepare a new face and shining for this new me. With this mask will cut off,"This thirteen lines poem, The Face Mask, is divided into two parts. The first one talks about the fashionable form of the poem that is well depicted by the words like ‘sandal and turmeric dust’, ‘Yogurt’, ‘a few drops of rose-watered hope’, while the second part tells about who the poet use this mask made-up with the application of ‘sandal and turmeric dust’, ‘Yogurt’, ‘a few drops of rose-watered hope’, in order to wash away the past speckled with yellow ‘maybes’. Besides, by dividing this poem into two parts, the poet wants to differentiate between the masked face and the unmasked face. The poet also wants to show how the people hide their true selves through the mask of make-up, especially the women who are very make-up conscious. The poet Anita Nair is herself a woman, and she is writing about the two facets of make-up that a woman applies on her face then she may be indicating towards the women who have dual character. Using the first-person pronoun ‘I’, the poet takes the responsibility of all the blames she levies on the semi-made-up and over-made-up women. With the use of ‘I’, she is addressing the whole women community who bears the mask of make-up to hide their true selves."
1593,1604,1604,"There are some days the happy ocean lies
Like an unfingered harp, below the land.
Afternoon guilds all the silent wires
Into a burning music for the eyes
On mirrors flashing between fine-strung fires
The shore, heaped up with roses, horses, spires
Wanders on water tall above ribbed sand.
The motionlessness of the hot sky tires
And a sigh, like a woman's from inland,
Brushes the instrument with shadowy hand
Drawing across those wires some gull's sharp cry
Or bell, or shout, from distant, hedged-in, shires;
These, deep as anchors, the hushing wave buries.
Then from the shore, two zig-zag butterflies
Like errant dog-roses cross the bright strand
Spiralling over waves in dizzy gyres
Until the fall in wet reflected skies.
They drown. Fishermen understand
Such wings sunk in such ritual sacrifice.
Remembering legends of undersea, drowned cities.
What voyagers, oh what heroes, flamed like pyres
With helmets plumed have set forth from some island
And them the seas engulfed. Their eyes
Distorted to the cruel waves desires,
Glitter with coins through the tide scarcely scanned,
While, far above, that harp assumes their sighs.",The happy ocean lies like an unfingered harp below the land. Aftern,"'Seascape' by Stephen Spender is an interesting poem about the sea and its power over humanity. In the first part of the poem, the speaker begins by describing the sea as a peaceful, quiet, unfingered harp. It's sitting, waiting for something to happen. When the sea is stimulated, by even the smallest occurrence, a great deal of death can result. The poet uses the final stanza to bring in images of travelers and explorers who believed they could control or conquer the sea but have been lost to it."
1594,1605,1605,"“Then what is life?” I cried. From his rent deeps
Of soul the poet cast that burning word;
And it should seem as though his prayer was heard,
For he died soon; and now his rest he keeps
Somewhere with the great spirit who never sleeps!
He had left us to murmur on awhile
And question still most fruitlessly this pile
Of natural shows, What life is? Why man weeps?
Why sins?—and whither when the awful veil
Floats on to him he sinks from earthly sight?

For thinking on the general mystery,
Ground of all being; yet may I rather be
Of those who know and feel that it is night.",The poet's words were a resounding resounding resoun,"“A Question by Shelley” by Alfred Lord Tennyson is a sonnet that speaks on the greatest unanswered questions of life and the fear that they will never be answered. The poem begins with the speaker referencing some of the last words that Percy Bysshe Shelley, one of the greatest Romantic poets, wrote before his death. These words, “Then what is life?” are the basis for the poem. Shelley never provided the speaker, presumably Tennyson himself, with an answer and he is deeply upset by this. Tennyson believes that Shelley might have has his question answered though because soon after these words were written Shelley died. In the next section of lines, Tennyson describes the fervor with which he and those like him discuss these questions of life. They want to know why there is sin in the world and what happens after death. He believes that Shelley has “left” them to “murmur” on these topics for the rest of time. A Question by Shelley concludes with the speaker describing two different types of people, those who care about these questions and those who don't. He is happy to count himself among the latter, even though it is the harder path."

They are unique and complicated in their own way. It alludes to the fact that every relationship can be complicated, be it with family, friends, lovers, or colleagues. In the last line, the poet singles out one “door” from the thousand doors to express that no matter how many complicated relationships a person has in their life, there is always one person that surpasses them."
1596,1607,1607,"Today as we flew the kites -
the sand spinning off in ribbons along the beach
and that gasoline smell from Leuchars gusting across
the golf links;
The tide far out
and quail-grey in the distance; people
jogging, or stopping to watch
as the war planes cambered and turned
in the morning light –
today - with the news in my mind, and the muffled dread
of what may come – I knelt down in the sand
with Lucas gathering shells and pebbles finding evidence of life in all this
driftwork: snail shells; shreds of razorfish;
smudges of weed and flesh on tideworn stone.


At times I think what makes us who we are
is neither kinship nor our given states
but something lost between the world we own
and what we dream about behind the names
on days like this our lines raised in the wind
our bodies fixed and anchored to the shore
and though we are confined by property
what tether us to gravity and light
has most to do with distance and the shapes
we find in water reading from the book
of silt and tides the rose or petrol blue
of jellyfish and sea anemone
combining with a child’s
first nakedness.

Sometimes I am dizzy with the fear
of losing everything – the sea, the sky,
all living creatures, forests, estuaries:
we trade so much to know the virtual
we scarcely register the drift and tug
of other bodies scarcely apprehend

and weather and the quiet, local forms

The poem takes the reader through a series of images that depict a small town in Scotland around the time of the bombing of the Twin Towers in New York City in September of 2001. While the poet does not explicitly mention 9/11 in the text, there are a number of allusions to the events on that day and the days that followed. The child shifting through the sand seeking out signs of life speaks to the search for bodies. The flesh on the rocks to the loss of those loved by so many. In these lines, in amongst the beauty of the scene, the speaker alludes to something terrible that's on its way. This pressure is increased by the Air Force base in the town and the smell of gasoline. The second stanza is more complicated and links into the third stanza as the poet delves into what matters in human life and what we should care about. One poignant section of 'History' deals with the fleeting nature of human dreams but our inability to let them go. He also speaks on caring for things, large and small, that make the world what it is. There is an emphasis placed on the ocean, as well as human life. He asks the reader to consider how one should live in the world without doing harm."

Ramanujan tells of the sexual awakening of a young woman and her attempts to recreate the experience. The poem begins with the speaker telling the reader about a young girl. When she was a child, only “four or five” she would sit with her cousin on a village swing. This was an important experience for her as the “lunging” motion of the swing and the closeness of her male cousin made her aware of her own sexuality, even at a very young age. In the second half of the poem, the speaker says that the cousin is older now. She searches different cities for a similar tree and swing. This alludes to her desire for an innocent, yet fulfilling, sexual experience, such as that she had when she was a child."

Then lay before him all thou hast; allow
No cloud of passion to usurp thy brow,
Or mar thy hospitality; no wave
Of mortal tumult to obliterate

The poet uses slightly complex syntax in 'Sorrow' that might lead to different interpretations of his meaning. In the first lines, the poet's speaker asks the reader to consider their sorrows and then prepare themselves for God's messenger. This requires dedication and even-mindedness and devotion. One has to remain penitent and calm, with their emotions, positive and negative, in the back of their mind. Grief, the speaker says, is like joy. Both emotions should be treated the same way and inspire great thoughts and grave thoughts to the end when one meets their death and God."
1599,1610,1610,"LOVE, a child, is ever crying;

Please him, and he straight is flying;

Give him, he the more is craving,

Never satisfied with having.

His desires have no measure;

Endless folly is his treasure;

What he promiseth he breaketh;

Trust not one word that he speaketh.

He vows nothing but false matter;

And to cozen you will flatter;

Let him gain the hand, he’ll leave you

And still glory to deceive you.

He will triumph in your wailing;

And yet cause be of your failing:

These his virtues are, and slighter

Are his gifts, his favours lighter.

Feathers are as firm in staying;

Wolves no fiercer in their preying;

As a child then, leave him crying;

Nor seek him so given to flying.","Love, a child, is ever crying; Please him, and he straight is flying","‘Love, a child, is ever crying’ is part of a sonnet sequence called Pamphilia to Amphilanthus. The songs in the sonnet sequence convey a conversation in which Pamphilia, a lady, tries to convince Amphilanthus, a man, that love needs to be controlled. This song, in particular, Song: “Love, a child, is ever crying”, explains the reasons why Amphilanthus needs to be careful. The main theme of Song: “Love, a child, is ever crying” is the nature of Love. Nevertheless, the poem doesn’t have an innocent view of love and serves as a warning of its nature. The tone of the poem is hurtful and cynical. Moreover, the lyrical voice seems relatively emotionless at some points of the song due to the advice she is giving to Amphilanthus."

They will always find their way back to each other, with the poet suggesting that 'Our Story' the story of their love, is one that never stops, always returning to flourish anew. The poem engages with ideas of death and the afterlife, the cyclic nature of life being a core theme."

He can't fulfill his longing and therefore has resorted to begging this person to visit him in his dreams. It is only these imagined encounters that are going to make the days bearable, he thinks. The poem repeats its first stanza at the end of the piece, reiterating everything the speaker previously asserted."
1602,1613,1613,"As I have gone alone in there
And with my treasures bold,
I can keep my secret where,
And hint of riches new and old.

Begin it where warm waters halt
And take it in the canyon down,
Not far, but too far to walk.
Put in below the home of Brown.

From there it’s no place for the meek,
The end is drawing ever nigh;
There’ll be no paddle up your creek,
Just heavy loads and water high.

If you’ve been wise and found the blaze,
Look quickly down, your quest to cease,
But tarry scant with marvel gaze,
Just take the chest and go in peace.

So why is it that I must go
And leave my trove for all to seek?
The answer I already know
I’ve done it tired, and now I’m weak.

So hear me all and listen good,
Your effort will be worth the cold.
If you are brave and in the wood
I give you title to the gold.","I have gone alone in there And with my treasures bold, I can keep my secret where","The Treasure Poem by Forrest Fenn is a six stanza poem that follows a simple rhyme scheme. This is something that should be taken into consideration when unpacking what might be a beneficial clue what might simply be a rhyming word. There are in total, supposedly, nine clues hidden within the six stanzas. This can be thought of in several different ways. First, that each sforrentence is a clue. There are a total of nine sentences in the poem but some seem to be much more important than others. The first stanza is a single sentence and is supposedly one of the least important stanzas of Forrest Fenn's Treasure Poem. The second speaks of “warm waters” a “canyon” and walking. In the third sentence, Fenn discusses the “Home of Brown” which is undoubtedly important. Then the fourth sentence mentions words like “Meek” and “loads” which are likely part of a clue. The fifth sentence is about the blaze and how fast one must look for the treasure. The six mentions the unusual word “trove”. In the eighth Fenn speaks of listening closely to his words and it being “worth the cold”. Then, in the final sentence, he uses the word “brave” and says that you have to be “in the wood”. Alternatively, one might consider the nine clues as going from start to finish, beginning with the word “Begin” in the second stanza. This leads one to the canyon down that's too far to walk. Then, onto the home of brown and no place for the meek. Next, there is the end which is coming closer and the creek up which one can't go with a paddle. Then there are the waters, the heavy loads and the blaze. Finally, the ninth clue is to move quickly down."

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker starts out describing the unfortunate end a vain woman came to. She surrounded herself with mirrors, that is, until the villagers entered her home, and she was forced to disappear into one. These relatively straightforward details have a clearly fantastical element to them. The speaker describes how the woman haunted the home, making various men and women disappear. The speaker transitions into speaking about the poem itself and how, like the mirror, it consumes people. Many are like “you.” By using second-person pronouns, the reader becomes part of the narrative. Here, the language changes again, and readers find themselves engaged with more colloquial speech with misspellings and more. When the poem concludes, the speaker details some of the statistics around the poem and all the people that have disappeared."

He hopes to convince the woman he loves to step into the light and be admired. The poem begins with the speaker asking a rose to speak with a woman he loves. It is through the beauty of the rose he to convince the woman of a number of things. The most important of these is that he is worth loving and she is worth admiring. He no longer wants her to hide from him. The speaker believes her beauty, and time on earth, is going to waste because she does not allow him to look at her. The poem concludes with the speaker telling the rose to “die” after speaking with the woman. This final shock will further motivate the woman to come forward and stop, he thinks, wasting her time."

He goes on to tell the woman that her “lover threw” his hands in the air while in battle, perhaps because he was injured. In the next stanzas, the speaker describes how soldiers usually act in battle and how they are made to fight and die. He also speaks to a child and a mother, telling them not to cry in the face of death either."

The poem begins with the speaker describing how humankind, at least the majority of it, lives in a cycle of rising, toiling, and retiring for the night. This repeats over and over again as the wind blows and the frost and rainfall. He continues on to describe how there is no reason to be sad, it is a “thriftless” or indulgent emotion. One cannot alter one state of being by mourning over it. The second half of the poem introduces the speaker's own experience. He believes that a life spent thinking and mourning is one wasted. He does not have time for such frivolous pursuits as he has a goal in mind. The speaker is on a journey and he is ready for anything he might be confronted with. His path is his own and just as one cannot change the trajectory of the world, his own life cannot be altered."

All will be free of fear and “Sorrow.” The speaker continues on to say that after death there will be no need to pray for the rest, as that's now possible for the rest of eternity. “Morn,” or morning, meaning the light of God, will be triumphant on the mountaintop. There, the light will dispel any darkness. In conclusion, the speaker describes how the “light” will clear the blood from all eyes, and everyone will live in long yearned for peace."
1609,1620,1620,"O young Lochinvar is come out of the west,
Through all the wide Border his steed was the best;
And save his good broadsword he weapons had none,
He rode all unarm’d, and he rode all alone.
So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,
There never was knight like the young Lochinvar.

He staid not for brake, and he stopp’d not for stone,
He swam the Eske river where ford there was none;
But ere he alighted at Netherby gate,
The bride had consented, the gallant came late:
For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,
Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.

So boldly he enter’d the Netherby Hall,
Among bride’s-men, and kinsmen, and brothers and all:
Then spoke the bride’s father, his hand on his sword,
(For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word,)
“O come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,
Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?”

“I long woo’d your daughter, my suit you denied;—
Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide—
And now I am come, with this lost love of mine,
To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.
There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far,
That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar.”

The bride kiss’d the goblet: the knight took it up,
He quaff’d off the wine, and he threw down the cup.
She look’d down to blush, and she look’d up to sigh,
With a smile on her lips and a tear in her eye.
He took her soft hand, ere her mother could bar,—
“Now tread we a measure!” said young Lochinvar.

So stately his form, and so lovely her face,
That never a hall such a galliard did grace;
While her mother did fret, and her father did fume,
And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume;
And the bride-maidens whisper’d, “’twere better by far
To have match’d our fair cousin with young Lochinvar.”

One touch to her hand, and one word in her ear,
When they reach’d the hall-door, and the charger stood near;
So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung,
So light to the saddle before her he sprung!
“She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur;
They’ll have fleet steeds that follow,” quoth young Lochinvar.

There was mounting ’mong Graemes of the Netherby clan;
Forsters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode and they ran:
There was racing and chasing on Cannobie Lee,
But the lost bride of Netherby ne’er did they see.

Have ye e’er heard of gallant like young Lochinvar?","O young Lochinvar is come out of the west, Through all the wide Border his","'Lochinvar' is about a brave and honorable Scottish knight whose beloved, Ellen, has been betrothed to a cowardly and unromantic man. It is told from the third person, and the speaker never identifies themself. The poem opens in the middle of the action, with the bold knight Lochinvar riding swiftly and courageously across the Scottish border from the west. He travels through rough terrain unphased until he finally makes it to Netherby Hall, where the woman he loves, Ellen, lives. However, he is late to the party and discovers that Ellen has already agreed to marry an unnamed man. Lochinvar promptly approaches Ellen's father, who does not trust Lochinvar. However, Lochinvar promises him that his love for Ellen has subsided, and he has only come for one glass of wine and a dance with the future bride. Ellen then kisses a cup of wine and hands it to Lochinvar, who drinks it all in one big gulp. Then, he takes Ellen's hand and dances with her. Ellen's father grows angry, her mother frets, and her betrothed looks down in disappointment while all her cousins whisper about what a good match Lochinvar is for Ellen. Meanwhile, as the two dance throughout the hall, they get closer and closer to Lochinvar's horse. Then, suddenly, Lochinvar tosses Ellen on the saddle, and they ride away. Ellen's family searches for her, but they never find her. Presumably, Ellen and Lochinvar have ridden off into the sunset and will live happily ever after."

The poet begins by describing a brewing storm near sunset along the California coast. He watches as the clouds gather before the sky sleeps. Using personification and an apostrophe, he addresses the earth, asking if it, too, like a poor girl longing for a taller lover and beautiful hair, is plagued by excessive desires. These are experienced by people, and perhaps the earth alike, during sleep. The poem ends with a Biblical allusion to the story of Jacob and the stone pillow."

And You practised Your love","Historical Background Meera, Mirabai, or Meerabai, lived in the sixteenth century, and was born to an Indian royal family, where she grew up to become a devoted Hindu and poet in the Bhakti movement. The Bhakti movement was a branch of Hinduism that viewed a person's journey towards their own spirituality as being a deeply personal one that was distinct and unhindered by an individual's caste or gender. Mirabai, who is a saint to the movement, was known for embodying these concepts; according to legends surrounding her, she was unconcerned with social conventions that were considered mandatory for her time, and made her faith in Krishna a central aspect of her life, writing poems and songs in his honour that are well-known even today. Mirabai is generally considered to have been born in the final few years of the fifteenth century, and to have lived for between 47 and 48 years. First-hand accounts from the poet-saint herself are extremely rare, and as such, most of the information concerning her — including her poems — are second-hand or disputable sources. Much of Mirabai's life appears in legends and fold tales with fairly little to distinguish facts from fictions. Even her poems are a subject of dispute — there are thousands of poems attributed to her authorship, but relatively few can be accurately attributed to her. Many of these poems were in fact written by her followers and by those who were closely connected to her in her life and after her death — as such, it is difficult to properly attribute many of her poems to her own pen, 'A Limb Just Moved' included. That the poems need to be translated into modern English is also a potential issue for discerning meaning."

In this poem, Browning's poetic persona is a listener of a toccata of Galuppi or a musician himself. While he plays or listens to his immortal music, though swept away, gets transposed into old Venice. The music helps him to visualize the country, her people, the carnival, and above all, Baldassare playing at his clavichord. The speaker's keen sense of music gets portrayed in this poem too. However, in the end, he laments the loss of such a prodigious musician's immortal music as well as the loss of the glory of flourishing Venice."

Tolkien contains the thoughts of an aged speaker who is contemplating his past, present, and inescapable future death. The poem begins with the speaker acknowledging the fact that eventually, a time will come in which he does not see another season. This brings him great sadness and forces him to recall the springs, summers, and autumns he lived through. They were vibrant and beautiful. Now though, they only exist within his mind. Within the second stanza, the speaker continues his meditation on life and death. He is sitting and thinking about everything he didn't get to see or do. The speaker is still very concerned with the natural world and marks his missed opportunities through un-witnessed “green” spaces. The mood of the poem darkens as he describes the fact that the future generations will know a world he will never see. This is something that deeply bothers him and over which he would like to mourn. Before he can progress any farther into sadness the present draws his attention. He mentions that there will soon be the sounds of footsteps returning to his door. These are his friends and family members who he would rather enjoy while he can then mourn over something he can't change."

They take more pleasure from one another and from their small rewards than the rich do with all their many objects and comforts."

No driftwood, such as abounds on the roaring shingle,
To be hefted home, for fires in the kitchen stove;
Barrels, banged ashore about the boiling outer harbor;
Lobster-buoys, on the eel-grass of the sheltered cove:
There, thought unbraids itself, and the mind becomes single.
There you row with tranquil oars, and the ocean
Shows no scar from the cutting of your placid keel;
Care becomes senseless there; pride and promotion
Remote; you only look; you scarcely feel.
Even adventure, with its vital uses,
Is aimless ardour now; and thrift is waste.
Oh, to be there, under the silent spruces,
Where the wide, quiet evening darkens without haste
Over a sea with death acquainted, yet forever chaste.","There, there where those black spruces crowd To the edge of the precipitous","'Ragged Island' by Edna St. Vincent Millay is a thoughtful poem about the peace the poet experienced on Ragged Island. The first part of the poem describes the island, the trees, and the cliffs. She spends a number of lines writing about the water/waves around the island and how peaceful and calm they are. They reflect the poet's mindset when she's present on the island. As the poem progresses, she alludes to how quiet it is and how one's concerns about the real world are entirely meaningless there."

This piece begins with a welcoming approach. The speaker tells her partner not to waste any time and make the most of the moment. She assures him that she would call him back in the future. But, the probability of calling depends on some circumstance that she cannot reveal. However, all she wants is to enjoy the time they are having right now. Nobody knows what is going to happen in the future. For this reason, they should delve into something meaningful. Finally, she informs her partner that her emotions for him are true."
1618,1629,1629,"August ’twas the twenty-fifth,
Seventeen hundred forty-six;
The Indians did in ambush lay,
Some very valiant men to slay,
The names of whom I’ll not leave out.

And though he was so brave and bold,
His face no more shalt we behold

Before he had time to fight, –
Before he did the Indians see,
Was shot and killed immediately.
Oliver Amsden he was slain,
Which caused his friends much grief and pain.
Simeon Amsden they found dead,
Not many rods distant from his head.
Adonijah Gillett we do hear
Did lose his life which was so dear.
John Sadler fled across the water,
And thus escaped the dreadful slaughter.

And hopes to save herself by running,
And had not her petticoats stopped her,
The awful creatures had not catched her,
Nor tommy hawked her on the head,
And left her on the ground for dead.

It is written in rhyming couplets. The lines vary in length and in the amount of syllables making the meter uneven. The song has a sort of nursery rhyme feel to it. It doesn't contain great amounts of poetic prowess. It isn't laden with colourful metaphors but it does have a sort of simplistic beauty to it.
1619,1630,1630,"The bicycles go by in twos and threes -
There's a dance in Billy Brennan's barn tonight,
And there's the half-talk code of mysteries
And the wink-and-elbow language of delight.
Half-past eight and there is not a spot
Upon a mile of road, no shadow thrown
That might turn out a man or woman, not
A footfall tapping secrecies of stone. I have what every poet hates in spite
Of all the solemn talk of contemplation.
Oh, Alexander Selkirk knew the plight
Of being king and government and nation.
A road, a mile of kingdom. I am king
Of banks and stones and every blooming thing.",The bicycles go by in twos and threes - There's a dance,"'Inniskeen Road: July Evening' by Patrick Kavanagh speaks on the poet's own feelings of isolation stemming from his inability to join society. The poem begins with the speaker stating that everyone around him is going to a party. It is taking place at a house down the road and he watches as the attendees' cycle together. No one is alone, except for him. This is what he is used to though. He has lived his whole life as an outsider looking in on a world he is unable to interpret. Their signs, languages, and movements mean nothing to him. They are mysteries. In the second stanza, he states that it is his role as “poet” that contributes to these feelings of otherness. He might pretend to love “contemplation” and solitude that are inherent to the artistic stereotype but that's not really the case. He struggles over finding balance in his own world as “king and government and nation.” The poem concludes by stating that the poet is able to find some peace in nature amongst signs and symbols he understands."
1620,1631,1631,"’Twas on a lofty vase’s side,
Where China’s gayest art had dyed
The azure flowers that blow;
Demurest of the tabby kind,
The pensive Selima, reclined,
Gazed on the lake below.

Her conscious tail her joy declared;
The fair round face, the snowy beard,
The velvet of her paws,
Her coat, that with the tortoise vies,
Her ears of jet, and emerald eyes,
She saw; and purred applause.

Still had she gazed; but ’midst the tide
Two angel forms were seen to glide,
The genii of the stream;
Their scaly armour’s Tyrian hue
Through richest purple to the view
Betrayed a golden gleam.

The hapless nymph with wonder saw;
A whisker first and then a claw,
With many an ardent wish,
She stretched in vain to reach the prize.
What female heart can gold despise?
What cat’s averse to fish?

Presumptuous maid! with looks intent
Again she stretch’d, again she bent,
Nor knew the gulf between.
(Malignant Fate sat by, and smiled)
The slippery verge her feet beguiled,
She tumbled headlong in.
Eight times emerging from the flood
She mewed to every watery god,
Some speedy aid to send.
No dolphin came, no Nereid stirred;
Nor cruel Tom, nor Susan heard;
A Favourite has no friend!

From hence, ye beauties, undeceived,
Know, one false step is ne’er retrieved,
And be with caution bold.
Not all that tempts your wandering eyes
And heedless hearts, is lawful prize;
Nor all that glisters, gold.","The nymph with wonder saw; A whisker first and then a claw,","This poem, ‘Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat Drowned in a Tub of Gold Fishes’, is based on an actual incident that occurred in the house of a friend of Gray’s. This friend had two pet cats, both of them female. The cats had been given the names Selima and Zara. Gray, in the course of a visit to his friend’s house, had seen these cats. Sometime later, the friend had written to Gray, informing him about the death of one of the cats, naming the cat which had died, and adding that the cat had accidentally been drowned in the tub of water in which the friend had been keeping some goldfish. It seemed to Gray that this incident could serve as the basis for his writing of an amusing poem from which readers could not only derive amusement but also draw a moral."
1621,1632,1632,"Sit on the bed; I'm blind, and three parts shell. Be careful; can't shake hands now; never shall.
Both arms have mutinied against me,—brutes.
My fingers fidget like ten idle brats.
I tried to peg out soldierly,—no use!
One dies of war like any old disease.
This bandage feels like pennies on my eyes.
I have my medals?—Discs to make eyes close.
My glorious ribbons?—Ripped from my own back
In scarlet shreds. (That's for your poetry book.)
A short life and a merry one, my buck!
We used to say we'd hate to live dead-old,—
Yet now ... I'd willingly be puffy, bald,
And patriotic. Buffers catch from boys
At least the jokes hurled at them. I suppose
Little I'd ever teach a son, but hitting,
Shooting, war, hunting, all the arts of hurting.
Well, that's what I learnt,—that, and making money.
Your fifty years ahead seem none too many?
Tell me how long I've got? God! For one year
To help myself to nothing more than air!
One Spring! Is one too good to spare, too long?
Spring wind would work its own way to my lung,
And grow me legs as quick as lilac-shoots.
My servant's lamed, but listen how he shouts!
When I'm lugged out, he'll still be good for that.
Here in this mummy-case, you know, I've thought
How well I might have swept his floors for ever.
I'd ask no night off when the bustle's over,
Enjoying so the dirt. Who's prejudiced
Against a grimed hand when his own's quite dust,
Less live than specks that in the sun-shafts turn,
Less warm than dust that mixes with arms' tan?
I'd love to be a sweep, now, black as Town,
Yes, or a muckman. Must I be his load?
O Life, Life, let me breathe,—a dug-out rat!
Not worse than ours the lives rats lead—
Nosing along at night down some safe rut,
They find a shell-proof home before they rot.
Dead men may envy living mites in cheese,
Or good germs even. Microbes have their joys,
And subdivide, and never come to death. Certainly flowers have the easiest time on earth.

I shall be better off with plants that share
More peaceably the meadow and the shower.
Soft rains will touch me,— as they could touch once,
And nothing but the sun shall make me ware.

Or, if I wince, I shall not know I wince.

On other sighs and wiped by fresher winds.

1622,1633,1633,"Light flows our war of mocking words, and yet,
Behold, with tears mine eyes are wet!
I feel a nameless sadness o'er me roll.
Yes, yes, we know that we can jest,
We know, we know that we can smile!
But there's a something in this breast,
To which thy light words bring no rest,
And thy gay smiles no anodyne.
Give me thy hand, and hush awhile,
And turn those limpid eyes on mine,
And let me read there, love! thy inmost soul.
Alas! is even love too weak
To unlock the heart, and let it speak?
Are even lovers powerless to reveal
To one another what indeed they feel?
I knew the mass of men conceal'd
Their thoughts, for fear that if reveal'd
They would by other men be met
With blank indifference, or with blame reproved;
I knew they lived and moved
Trick'd in disguises, alien to the rest
Of men, and alien to themselves—and yet
The same heart beats in every human breast!
But we, my love!—doth a like spell benumb
Our hearts, our voices?—must we too be dumb?
Ah! well for us, if even we,
Even for a moment, can get free
Our heart, and have our lips unchain'd;
For that which seals them hath been deep-ordain'd!
Fate, which foresaw
How frivolous a baby man would be—
By what distractions he would be possess'd,
How he would pour himself in every strife,
And well-nigh change his own identity—
That it might keep from his capricious play
His genuine self, and force him to obey
Even in his own despite his being's law,
Bade through the deep recesses of our breast
The unregarded river of our life
Pursue with indiscernible flow its way;
And that we should not see
The buried stream, and seem to be
Eddying at large in blind uncertainty,
Though driving on with it eternally.
But often, in the world's most crowded streets,
But often, in the din of strife,
There rises an unspeakable desire
After the knowledge of our buried life;
A thirst to spend our fire and restless force
In tracking out our true, original course;
A longing to inquire
Into the mystery of this heart which beats
So wild, so deep in us—to know
Whence our lives come and where they go.
And many a man in his own breast then delves,
But deep enough, alas! none ever mines.
And we have been on many thousand lines,
And we have shown, on each, spirit and power;
But hardly have we, for one little hour,
Been on our own line, have we been ourselves—
Hardly had skill to utter one of all
The nameless feelings that course through our breast,
But they course on for ever unexpress'd.
And long we try in vain to speak and act
Our hidden self, and what we say and do
Is eloquent, is well—but 't is not true!
And then we will no more be rack'd
With inward striving, and demand
Of all the thousand nothings of the hour
Their stupefying power;
Ah yes, and they benumb us at our call!
Yet still, from time to time, vague and forlorn,
From the soul's subterranean depth upborne
As from an infinitely distant land,
Come airs, and floating echoes, and convey
A melancholy into all our day.
Only—but this is rare—
When a belovèd hand is laid in ours,
When, jaded with the rush and glare
Of the interminable hours,
Our eyes can in another's eyes read clear,
When our world-deafen'd ear
Is by the tones of a loved voice caress'd—
A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast,
And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again.
The eye sinks inward, and the heart lies plain,
And what we mean, we say, and what we would, we know.
A man becomes aware of his life's flow,
And hears its winding murmur; and he sees
The meadows where it glides, the sun, the breeze.
And there arrives a lull in the hot race
Wherein he doth for ever chase
That flying and elusive shadow, rest.
An air of coolness plays upon his face,
And an unwonted calm pervades his breast.
And then he thinks he knows
The hills where his life rose,
And the sea where it goes.",A man's heart is a symphony of syll,"'Buried Life' by Matthew Arnold is a monologue through which a distressed speaker analyzes his complicated feelings about his inner life. The poem begins by describing an emotional experience had by the speaker in which he is struck by an uncontrollable sadness. He is inflicted with a moment of perception due to his interactions with his lover. The next sections move through the way that “man” lives and how fate determined his obstinacy and inability to understand his own life. Nevertheless, one should strive to enter their own “buried life.” It is one's true self, striped of pretence and the “rush” of the world. The poem concludes with the speaker stating that one can see their own buried life in the eyes and touch of their lover. This is a place of peace and easy knowledge."

The speaker spends the twelve lines of the poem outlining what feeling her sorrow is like. She has no reprieve from it, day or night, and nowhere to go that makes her feel as if there is a purpose to life. She watches people go about their lives while she remains where she is. She expresses disinterest in what she does or what she wears."

In the first lines of 'Memories of West Street and Lepke,' Lowell depicts his home in Boston where he works as a professor. This leads him to reminiscence about his time in prison for objecting to serving in the Second World War. He alludes to a letter he wrote to President Roosevelt and what it was like to be in the “bull pen” before being convicted to one year and a day in prison. The second half of the poem focuses on this period in his life and the people he met. These included Bioff and Brown, two men imprisoned for extortion, and Lepke, the mob boss of Murder Incorporated. Despite spending a great deal of time going into details about his life, what he saw around him in prison, and more, Lowell's speaker (who is likely Lowell himself) does not pass judgment on any of these things. They are simply statements of the past and what the world used to be like for him and others."

Approaching the window, he looks out over the city and watches the beautiful stars shine down.

Dryden separated this poem into eight sections. In each stanza, he talks about different aspects of music and classical musicians. The first stanza introduces to the audience how divine harmony lies in everything. Music, being a divine art form, infuses life into nature. From the following stanzas, the poetic persona talks about different instruments such as “corded shell,” trumpet, drum, flute, violin, and last but not least, Cecilia's organ.

Yea, even in your grave her way
Is laid. Poor, troubled, lyric ghost,
Spring never was so fair and dear
As Beauty makes her seem this year.

Of Spring as any lamb that bleats
To feel the solid earth recoil
Beneath his puny legs. Spring beats
Her tocsin call to those who love her,
And lo! the dogwood petals cover

Her breast with drifts of snow, and sleek
White gulls fly screaming to her, and hover
About her shoulders, and kiss her cheek,
While white and purple lilacs muster
A strength that bears them to a cluster
Of color and odor; for her sake
All things that slept are now awake.

It’s a common theme, really – the poet leans back in their chair, taps their pen, and writes a thought-provoking, deeply philosophical, imaginative vision of some great mystery, leaving the reader to awe at their intellect and wisdom.

For Robert Service, ‘A Grain of Sand’ isn’t quite this – it’s neither colossal nor grand, but is one of his more philosophical works. The title of the poem itself is a common motif for seeing big ideas in small items and serves to prepare the reader for quite a bit of thinking. While by no means trying to unlock the secrets of life itself, ‘A Grain of Sand’ instead sees Service seemingly simply thinking aloud and inviting his reader to do the same."

This poem takes the reader through some of the attributes one particular crocodile displays. Deception and cunning are among these. He smiles cheerfully, basks in the sun, washes his scales, and opens his claws as if welcoming fish to his arms."

The poem shares a few important experiences in the lives of two people. It begins with a story about a birthday party, speaks about one person's past relationship, explores one's suicidal thoughts, and more. Throughout, the poet uses language that suggests that the two are struggling to get their words out. This includes long pauses between the phrases."
1633,1644,1644,"Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,
Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,
And towards our distant rest began to trudge.
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots
Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.

In all my dreams before my helpless sight,
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.

If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace
Behind the wagon that we flung him in,
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,
His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin;
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud

Pro patria mori.",The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est Pro patria mori,"The poem graphically and bitterly describes the horrors of that war in particular, although it also implicitly speaks of the horror of all wars. While it is easy to comment on the “horror of war” in the abstract, the poem’s depiction of these horrors is devastating in its specificity, and also in the way that Owen makes clear that such horror permeates all aspects of war. The banal daily life of a soldier is excruciating, the brutal reality of death is unimaginable agony, and even surviving a war after watching others die invites a future of endless trauma. The way Owen uses language to put readers inside the experiences of a soldier helps them begin to understand the horrific experience of all of these awful aspects of war."

'The British (serves 60 Million)' by Benjamin Zephaniah presents the history of Britain in an innovative manner. The poet refers to the period when Romans conquered England and the cultural assimilation first started here. Thereafter the poet refers to the Norman Conquest and how the French culture spread into Anglo-Saxon England. In the second stanza, there is no such reference to any major historical events of the group of nations. The poet refers to the people living in different regions of the world and how they got mixed into the British culture. In the last few lines of the poem, the poet upholds the language issue and provides a solution. According to the poet, the nation should allow her people to practice their own culture and language. However, the English language should act as a binding factor, not as a mechanism that uproots oneself from her identity. The poet also emphasizes unity and justice at the end of his poem. "

The poem starts with the speaker describing how men at forty have to close doors softly. They leave the past behind, closing it behind metaphorical doors with an accepting/resigned attitude. This is all part of aging and leaving one's youth behind. These themes are emphasized when the poet starts to talk about fathers and sons and the feeling of “it” when one is walking up the stairs. Age is catching up to these men, following them as they move through their lives. It's a feeling that emanates from the stairs and the yard outside their mortgaged homes."

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins by stating that some virgins, young women, who were sick of love became flowers. This is something to speaker says that he can prove. Now, considering flowers as transformed, pure, young women, the speaker still notes that a change comes over them. Some change colors and others don't. Here, readers are going to be left with a few questions regarding what exactly Herrick was getting at. It seems likely that he was attempting a comparison between pollinated flowers, or dying flowers, and young women who lose their virginity. While also speaking more broadly about the way that change manifests."

In the first part of the poem, the poet begins by describing the speaker taking out a necklace and relating it to feelings from the past and various impressions, many of which are dark and sorrowful. But, there is also an element of light there as the beads serve as a reminder of the life, filled with beauty and joy, that Persephone lived before becoming Hades' queen. The poem concludes with a few lines that tap in, quite emotionally, to a child's sorrow and concern that they will be forgotten."

The poem is quite short but in its twelve lines, the speaker takes the reader on a journey towards her understanding of the meaning, or lack thereof, of a rose. The speaker expresses her pleasure, at first, in seeing a single rose that her suitor gave her. It's perfect in every way and should by all rights be clearly conveying his emotions But, it turns out, this is not entirely true. The speaker is tired of roses. She is more interested in what else a potential lover can give her besides this tired symbol."

The poem starts with a dedication to Caroline Herschel, a famous female astronomer who, apparently, inspires the speaker. The speaker transitions from praising Herschel’s passion for astronomy to speaking of the loneliness Herschel and other female scientists felt. The speaker, who reveals herself to be a female scientist, informs readers of the source of their loneliness: society. Using astronomy-related metaphors, the speaker explains that by pursuing their passion for the universe, women like her and Herschel are isolated from society. This is because women studying astronomy defied society’s expectations of women. So, these women were seen as “monsters,” powerful and feared. The speaker then sets forth a case for female scientists, capturing their passion for the universe. She initially uses a male astronomer’s point of view to show that one’s awe of the universe transcends gender. Finally, the speaker ends with a declaration of her reasons for studying the universe. It simultaneously reads as a promise to never let her passion die.

1640,1651,1651,"That spring was late. We watched the sky
and studied charts for shouldering isobars.
Birds were late to pair. Crows drank from the lamb's eye.

Over Finland small birds fell: song-thrushes
steering north, smudged signatures on light,
migrating warblers, nightingales.

Wing-beats failed over fjords, each lung a sip of gall.
Children were warned of their dangerous beauty.
Milk was spilt in Poland. Each quarrel
the blowback from some old story,
a mouthful of bitter air from the Ukraine
brought by the wind out of its box of sorrows.

This spring a lamb sips caesium on a Welsh hill.
A child, lifting her head to drink the rain,
takes into her blood the poisoned arrow.

in Europe twinned to Chernobyl, each heart
with the burnt firemen, the child on the Moscow train.

Birds were late,"‘Neighbours’ is about the Chernobyl disaster and how it affected, not just Ukraine but the rest of Europe as well. The poem seems quite negative and solemn and draws on references to Pandora’s box to help make its point, but it also offers a ray of light. It references glasnost which was a Russian initiative put in place by then Russian prime minister Mikhail Gorbachev in order that Russia is more clear with its secrets, so as to not cover up mistakes that were made during the Chernobyl disaster. In turn, this would make Europe a safer place. This was seen by many in the west as a move to make Russia more part of the European community as relations between Russia and the rest of Europe had often been quite strained."

an indifference that gave me
logic and a measure: I too might stop wanting
the hand placed on back or shoulder
and never feel the desired response.

and inflict on me, the sudden jerking
of head away from halter, the tentative nose
inspecting first before it might decide
to relent and eat. I loved
what was not slave or instinct, that when you turn to me
it is a choice, it is always a choice to imagine pleasure
might be blended, one warmth

The poem takes the reader from the present, where the speaker is a grown woman, to the past where she was a young girl. She spends the bulk of the poem describing what it was like to grow up with her horse, Dandy. The speaker loved him for nontraditional reasons. He was headstrong and did not want to be cared for or ministered to. He would step on her feet, pull suddenly at the halter, and cause her pain. These things made her love him even more and he became a symbol of freedom and disobedience."

The first of these women is “repressed.” She lives a “black and white” life and, despite her young age, exhibits the characteristics of an older woman. She is contrasted with the second woman, someone who is filled with color. Her life is far more vibrant and satisfying. It's with this second woman that the speaker feels connected, but they make sure to state that they are really somewhere between the two. They're connected to them both. The speaker repeats the phrase, “How can they call her wrong,” several times in this poem, suggesting that there is someone, or some force, that disagrees with the second woman's life. The speaker fully supports it, though, and reminds the reader once more at the end of the poem how connected they are to this person."

The poem begins with the speaker describing how when he looks into his mirror he sees his wrinkled and “wasting skin.” Although he is able to recognize himself, he cannot reconcile what he sees in the mirror with what he feels in his heart. He might look like an old man, but he still feels young. This tension, between youth and age, pulls at him constantly.

The writer of this letter is addressing her thoughts to her “beloved.” She describes the entrance of anonymous military personnel from an unknown country, who's salute was terrifying. She and another, perhaps her brother, Jocko, attempt to avoid arrest but are unsuccessful. They are frozen in place, with terror and shock, represented by a vivid description of a tear freezing on and breaking off, Jocko's face. They are arrested and taken a prison described as being made of ice, there is a television in a block of ice in the corner, and Jocko kicks at the walls. She seeks to share her innermost thoughts with the reader, and wonders whether she will ever see a grape again, a connection to the vineyard where she met her beloved in October. She continues on, describing how back then she saw their futures so clearly. Now things begin to blur together, she skips back and forth between her current situation, their desperation, and her past. She describes trees as “glittering chandeliers” and later describes milking a cows, as she is forced to do, as similar to “cleansing a chandelier.” It is revealed that Jocko was shot for the trivial act of telling a joke. She asks the reader if the book she was reading is still open on their bedside table, and 'The Letter' ends by asking her beloved to treat it as a bookmark, “saving my place in our story.” The piece concludes with an endnote in parenthesis stating that it is here the letter ends."

Robert Frost makes 'Into My Own' an incredibly compelling and relatable poem. Although the anthology that includes 'Into My Own' wasn't published until Frost was almost forty, the poem was likely written when he was an adolescent, both anxious and excited about the journey to adulthood. The four-stanza poem deals with the feelings that everyone likely felt at the transition: perturbation, apprehension, even fear, but also excitement and eagerness at finding themselves in the world."
1649,1660,1660,"The woods decay, the woods decay and fall,
The vapours weep their burthen to the ground,
Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath,
And after many a summer dies the swan.
Me only cruel immortality
Consumes: I wither slowly in thine arms,
Here at the quiet limit of the world,
A white-hair'd shadow roaming like a dream
The ever-silent spaces of the East,
Far-folded mists, and gleaming halls of morn.
Alas! for this gray shadow, once a man—
So glorious in his beauty and thy choice,
Who madest him thy chosen, that he seem'd
To his great heart none other than a God!
I ask'd thee, 'Give me immortality.'
Then didst thou grant mine asking with a smile,
Like wealthy men, who care not how they give.
But thy strong Hours indignant work'd their wills,
And beat me down and marr'd and wasted me,
And tho' they could not end me, left me maim'd
To dwell in presence of immortal youth,
Immortal age beside immortal youth,
And all I was, in ashes. Can thy love,
Thy beauty, make amends, tho' even now,
Close over us, the silver star, thy guide,
Shines in those tremulous eyes that fill with tears
To hear me? Let me go: take back thy gift:
Why should a man desire in any way
To vary from the kindly race of men
Or pass beyond the goal of ordinance
Where all should pause, as is most meet for all?
A soft air fans the cloud apart; there comes
A glimpse of that dark world where I was born.
Once more the old mysterious glimmer steals
From thy pure brows, and from thy shoulders pure,
And bosom beating with a heart renew'd.
Thy cheek begins to redden thro' the gloom,
Thy sweet eyes brighten slowly close to mine,
Ere yet they blind the stars, and the wild team
Which love thee, yearning for thy yoke, arise,
And shake the darkness from their loosen'd manes,
And beat the twilight into flakes of fire.
Lo! ever thus thou growest beautiful
In silence, then before thine answer given
Departest, and thy tears are on my cheek.
Why wilt thou ever scare me with thy tears,
And make me tremble lest a saying learnt,
In days far-off, on that dark earth, be true?
'The Gods themselves cannot recall their gifts.'
Ay me! ay me! with what another heart
In days far-off, and with what other eyes
I used to watch—if I be he that watch'd—
The lucid outline forming round thee; saw
The dim curls kindle into sunny rings;
Changed with thy mystic change, and felt my blood
Glow with the glow that slowly crimson'd all
Thy presence and thy portals, while I lay,
Mouth, forehead, eyelids, growing dewy-warm
With kisses balmier than half-opening buds
Of April, and could hear the lips that kiss'd
Whispering I knew not what of wild and sweet,
Like that strange song I heard Apollo sing,
While Ilion like a mist rose into towers.
Yet hold me not for ever in thine East:
How can my nature longer mix with thine?
Coldly thy rosy shadows bathe me, cold
Are all thy lights, and cold my wrinkled feet
Upon thy glimmering thresholds, when the steam
Floats up from those dim fields about the homes
Of happy men that have the power to die,
And grassy barrows of the happier dead.
Release me, and restore me to the ground;
Thou seëst all things, thou wilt see my grave:
Thou wilt renew thy beauty morn by morn;
I earth in earth forget these empty courts,
And thee returning on thy silver wheels.",A white-haired shadow roaming like a dream The ever-silent,"'Tithonus' by Lord Alfred Tennyson describes the plight of Tithonus who is cursed to an immortal life in which he continues to age. The poem begins with the speaker, Tithonus, desiring how sorrowful the naturally aging woods make him. Unlike all the other elements of the world, he is unable to die. He cannot, as they do, return to the earth and become something new. He is slowly being consumed by the hours of his life that will never end. He is stuck in the “East” with his once beloved Eos who is the cause of his wretched state, (see About the Myth for more details). The speaker describes himself as no longer being a man, but a mere shadow who is forced to see the never-aging face of his beloved ever morning. In the next few line, he quickly outlines how he came to be this way. He describes asking Eos for immortality and her granting it to him without considering his youth. He will never pass beyond the “goal of ordinance” or reach death, as other men do. It is obvious to him now the mistake he has made. Every morning of Tithonus' life he is forced to see the sunrise and observe Eos' chariot take her into the sky where he once adored her. Every day he asks her to take back what she has given but receives no answer. He fears that she is unable to retract something she has given out. In the next section of the poem, the speaker is remembering an old lover he used to have and the simple times they were together. It is this life that he should have had. They lay together, touching mouths and eyelids without pretense or the pull of immortality. The poem concludes with the speaker asking that Eos free him from the East where he has been trapped and allow him to die. If he was to do so, he could join the other men in the earth and she could always look down on his grave."
1650,1661,1661,"I am so very far from you people, 
My fires are so very different

Muktibodh is torn by his inner dilemma in the poem. He utters the truth and presents the social evils in this poem. He voices the pang of the proletariat. The wretched finds voice in his words. Deceased, weak, poor, and helpless are his characters who face regular exploitation. Wealthy people build their empire on their bones. That's why the poet is angry and at the same time hopeless. His anger has turned into mourning in the poem, not to pacify the exploited but to enrage them to stand firm against all the social evils. He wants them to fight for their rights. This poem is a literary work of political dissonance and a powerful manifesto against the oppressors."
1651,1662,1662,"But I would rather be horizontal.
I am not a tree with my root in the soil

Nor am I the beauty of a garden bed

Unknowing I must soon unpetal.
Compared with me, a tree is immortal
And a flower-head not tall, but more startling,
And I want the one's longevity and the other's daring.
Tonight, in the infinitesimal light of the stars,
The trees and the flowers have been strewing their cool odors.
I walk among them, but none of them are noticing.
Sometimes I think that when I am sleeping
I must most perfectly resemble them --
Thoughts gone dim.
It is more natural to me, lying down.
Then the sky and I are in open conversation,
And I shall be useful when I lie down finally:
Then the trees may touch me for once, and the flowers have time for me.",I am not a tree with my root in the soil Sucking up minerals and mother,"I am Vertical' by Sylvia Plath is a narration of a speaker's internal desperation for true beauty and a worthy function within the world. The poem begins with the speaker stating that she is “vertical” and would like to be “horizontal” instead. One comes to the conclusion later that this position allows her to communicate with the “sky.” It also more closely resembles the positions of gardens she admires. And finally, it is a position of subjugation. She is opening herself up to be acted upon. She is no longer thinking or worrying about her own life. As the poem continues the speaker describes how she sees plants as being useful. They take from the earth and give back “gleaming” in the spring. She walks among them, but they do not see her. This fact is painful to the speaker and leads her to the determination that she would be better off “finally” dead. Her body would return to the earth and help the world, as the plants do."
1652,1663,1663,"NOW, rallying once if ne'er again,
With flag at half-mast flown,
A people in dire need and strain
Mans Tyra's bastion.

Betrayed in danger's hour, betrayed
Before the stress of strife!
Was this the meaning that it had--
That clasp of hands at Axelstad
Which gave the North new life?

The words that seemed as if they rushed
From deepest heart-springs out
Were phrases, then! -- the freshet gushed,
And now is fall'n the drought.
The tree, that promised rich in bloom
Mid festal sun and shower,
Stands wind-stript in the louring gloom,
A cross to mark young Norway's tomb,
The first dark testing-hour.

They were but Judas kisses, lies
In fatal wreaths enwound,
The cheers of Norway's sons, and cries
Towards the beach of Sound.
What passed that time we watched them meet,
'Twixt Norse and Danish lord?
Oh! nothing! only to repeat
King Gustav's play at Stockholm's seat
With the Twelfth Charles' sword.

'A people doomed, whose knell is rung,
Betrayed by every friend!' --
Is the book closed and the song sung?
Is this our Denmark's end?
Who set the craven colophon,
While Germans seized the hold,
And o'er the last Dane lying prone
Old Denmark's tattered flag was thrown
With doubly crimsoned fold?

But thou, my brother Norsemen, set
Beyond the war-storm's power
Because thou knewest to forget
Fair words in danger's hour:
Flee from thy homes of ancient fame--
Go chase a new sunrise--
Pursue oblivion, and for shame
Disguise thee in a stranger's name
To hide from thine own eyes!

Each wind that sighs from Danish waves
Through Norway's woods of pine,
Of thy pale lips an answer craves:
Where wast thou, brother mine?
I fought for both a deadly fight;
In vain to spy thy prow
O'er belt and fiord I strained my sight:
My fatherland with graves grew white:
My brother, where wast thou?

It was a dream! Arise, awake
To do a nation's deed!
Each to his post, swift counsel take;
A brother is in need!
A nobler song may yet be sung--
Danes, Danes, keep Tyra's hold--
And o'er a Northern era, young
And rich in hope, be proudly flung
The red flag's tattered fold.",The red flag's tattered fold is a symphony,"The poem begins with the speaker telling the people that they need to rally together, as if for the last time. They’re going to have to fight, with or without Norway in order to maintain their country as they have known it. Throughout the bulk of ‘A Brother in Need,’ Ibsen’s speaker addresses the Norwegian government which he believed owed Denmark their aid. They made promises that they didn’t keep, a betrayal the speaker compares to that between Judas and Jesus. The tone is melancholy and resigned throughout much of the text, but by the end, the speaker becomes reinvigorated and again tries to inspire the people to come together for the betterment of their country.

Whose foot ne’er tainted morning dew,

Who, nursed with tender care,
And to domesticate bounds confined,
Was still a wild jack-hare.
Though duly from my hand he took
His pittance every night,
He did it with a jealous look,
And, when he could, would bite.
His diet was of wheaten bread,
And milk, and oats, and straw,
Thistles, or lettuces instead,
With sand to scour his maw.
On twigs of hawthorn he regaled,
On pippins’ russet peel;
And, when his juicy salads failed,
Sliced carrot pleased him well.
A Turkey carpet was his lawn,
Whereon he loved to bound,
To skip and gambol like a fawn,
And swing his rump around.
His frisking was at evening hours,
For then he lost his fear;
But most before approaching showers,
Or when a storm drew near.
Eight years and five round-rolling moons
He thus saw steal away,
Dozing out all his idle noons,
And every night at play.
I kept him for his humor’s sake,
For he would oft beguile
My heart of thoughts that made it ache,
And force me to a smile.
But now, beneath this walnut-shade
He finds his long, last home,
And waits in snug concealment laid,
Till gentler Puss shall come.

From which no care can save,
And, partner once of Tiney’s box,
Must soon partake his grave.","The hound was a wild jack-hare, and he was ","'Epitaph on a Hare' by William Cowper describes the relationship between a pet hare and his owner who loved him unconditionally. The poem begins with the speaker describing his interactions with Tiney the hare. He is not always pleasant, sometimes biting his owner, but the speaker loves him all the same. The speaker describes the food eaten by the hare, and the rooms and enclosures he lives in. He has only the best materials around him. In the second half of the poem the speaker states that when the hare had passed away he buried him in a box under the walnut tree. It is here, in the shade, that he rests until another life begins.

I love not less, though less the show appear;
That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,

When I was wont to greet it with my lays;
As Philomel in summer’s front doth sing,
And stops his pipe in growth of riper days:
Not that the summer is less pleasant now
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
But that wild music burthens every bough,
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:
Because I would not dull you with my song.","My love is strengthened, though more weak in seeming; I love not less, though less","'Sonnet 102' by William Shakespeare depicts the nature of the speaker's love for the Fair Youth and why he doesn't always express it. The speaker directs his words to the youth, attempting to explain why he sometimes holds his tongue. It's not because his love has grown any less, but because he doesn't want to dull it by singing about it all the time. He compares his song, as a poet, to the song of a nightingale. If there is too much singing or too much verse composition, then those songs and poems are going to lose their impact. He doesn't want the Fair Youth to grow tired of his love and so he holds it back, ensuring that the Youth will always be moved by his words."

It is also known as the Northern Ireland conflict. The poet describes the aftermath of the sectarian riot in Belfast.

He continues on to ask that she not condemn him to death but give him a “nobler fate” at her side. By the end of the text, he is attempting to convince her to love him by telling her that he will write negative things about her in his poetry. If she is kind though, he will tell the world of her beauty and grace. "

Baxter describes the lack of confidence that a farmhand has regarding his appearance and relationship prospects. The poem begins with the speaker describing an interesting man who is both social and contemplative. He can often be found watching the dance floor of a music hall and observing all the beautiful comings and goings. It becomes clear that this man never does more than observe. He does not see himself as deserving or as being suited to the life of a lover. The farmhand, down on his own life and appearance, is able to take some comfort in the fact that he can still “hope” something good will happen to him. In the final lines, the speaker asks the reader not to judge the man based on how he looks or what he thinks he doesn't have but on what he displays during the harvest season. The man is uncommonly strong and hardworking. He also shows off a gentle side that he takes advantage of to care for machinery."

This poem begins with a speaker's heartfelt longing for the days when she was close to her mother. To be specific, she misses her days of infancy when her mother used to make her sleep, rocking her cradle, shading her from all the evil forces, comforting every need of hers. Now, when she is in grave emotional tension, the image of her mother reminds her what she needs the most. Therefore the poet says, “None like a mother can charm away pain.” All she wants if her mother were there, she would comfort her in the way she did. Therefore, at the end of each stanza, she urges, “Rock me to sleep, mother, – rock me to sleep!”"

The speaker is fascinated with the moon and sea, yet he is excited to see the day break where the sense of dominance is reversed."
1664,1675,1675,"“A true Arab knows how to catch a fly in his hands,”
my father would say. And he’d prove it,
cupping the buzzer instantly
while the host with the swatter stared.

In the spring our palms peeled like snakes.
True Arabs believed watermelon could heal fifty ways.
I changed these to fit the occasion.

Years before, a girl knocked,
wanted to see the Arab.
I said we didn’t have one.
After that, my father told me who he was,
“Shihab”—“shooting star”—
a good name, borrowed from the sky.
Once I said, “When we die, we give it back?”
He said that’s what a true Arab would say.

Today the headlines clot in my blood.
A little Palestinian dangles a truck on the front page.
Homeless fig, this tragedy with a terrible root
is too big for us. What flag can we wave?
I wave the flag of stone and seed,
table mat stitched in blue.

I call my father, we talk around the news.
It is too much for him,
neither of his two languages can reach it.
I drive into the country to find sheep, cows,
to plead with the air:
Who calls anyone civilized?
Where can the crying heart graze?
What does a true Arab do now?", A true Arab knows how to catch a fly in his hands.</s,"Blood' by Naomi Shihab Nye speaks on the poet's own sense of identity as a Palestinian- American growing up in-between the two cultures. The poem begins with the speaker telling a few stories from her youth. These were moments in which her father declared what a “true Arab” is. They always occurred in conjunction with proverb-like sayings or happenings. There were humorous moments in other's homes, strange encounters at their own doorstep, and terrible events that defied explanation. The latter is what the second half of the poem focuses on. Something occurred that shocked Nye and her family. She turned to her father for answers as she always did, and he didn't have any. She then went out into the countryside of her American home and asked the sheep and cows and sky what she should think, do, and what kind of person she should become.

1665,1676,1676,"At home the sea is in the town,
Running in and out of the cooking places,
Collecting the firewood from the hearths
And sending it back at night;
The sea eats the land at home.
It came one day at the dead of night,
Destroying the cement walls,
And carried away the fowls,
The cooking-pots and the ladles,
The sea eats the land at home;
It is a sad thing to hear the wails,
And the mourning shouts of the women,
Calling on all the gods they worship,
To protect them from the angry sea.
Aku stood outside where her cooking-pot stood,
With her two children shivering from the cold,
Her hands on her breasts,
Weeping mournfully.
Her ancestors have neglected her,
Her gods have deserted her,
It was a cold Sunday morning,
The storm was raging,
Goats and fowls were struggling in the water,
The angry water of the cruel sea;
The lap-lapping of the bark water at the shore,
And above the sobs and the deep and low moans,
Was the eternal hum of the living sea.
It has taken away their belongings
Adena has lost the trinkets which
Were her dowry and her joy,
In the sea that eats the land at home,
Eats the whole land at home.","The sea is in the town, Running in and out of the cooking places, Collecting","This poem is a story of a simple town through which sweeps the anger of a personified sea. The sea eats up the town and all the belongings of those that reside in it. The poem focuses on the general loss of the town but then zooms in on two women who have different experiences with the loss they go through. One, Aku, has lost everything and is left in the cold in what used to be her kitchen, and Adena, who has lost the trinkets that were her dowry. The poem concludes by saying that the sea that eats the land will eat anything, nothing is off-limits."

He gave a boon I valued more —
He gave me all his heart!


His soul sincere, his generous worth,

From shore to shore he flies;
Why wander riches to obtain,
When love is all I prize?

There is an interesting dichotomy; a woman values the loving relationship but the man is drawn to adventure, despite returning her love. The impact on the woman is profound. The reader is left with an inconclusive question and assumes the worst."

Your ears are,"‘Piazza Piece’ by John Crowe Ransom is a two-stanza poem that uses mismatching structure and elements to bring the reader into a historic world where “an old man” is “trying” to win the affections of “a lady” who does not share his interest. While the general concept of that plot would indicate that there is a vast separation between these two characters—and there is on many levels—Ransom ingeniously builds a subtle setup where the two are shown to be mirror reflections of one another in regard to their wishes and far-reaching goals. Despite their differences, and in contrast to how mismatched they are, the “old man” and the “lady” have a great deal in common."
1668,1679,1679,"To the boys who may one day date my daughter!
I have been waiting for you.
Since before her birth,
Since before my spark took hold and ignited the fire in her mother’s belly,
I have been training to kill you.
When you took your first steps I was preparing to make it so you never walked again,
When you played at war I was perfecting headshots,
You can’t catch up at this point.
And when you first meet my daughter and fall in love with the look she sends over her shoulder,
Her crescent-moon eyes framing her laughing smile, you
Are gonna wanna talk to her.
And when those hours pass by like sprinters during that first timeless conversation-
You will also know with a deep and impending sense of dread,
That you are going to have to talk to me
When you first come to my home, and see the bone carving over my threshold-
Try not to imagine your own femurs so expertly carved.
Pay no attention to my “ample crawl space”, my
“Room with a rubber mat and a drain”, be careful
To only approach me with love for my daughter,
See, I have been seeding her childhood with tap-root hugs
To weed out indifference and apathy,
There will be no Daddy Issues for your teenage talons to latch upon. If you
Break her heart; I will hear it snap with the ear I pressed against her mother’s belly-
The elbow I cradled her head in will send a message to my fist. My cheeks
Are attuned to her lips.
I will know if they tremble.


I have taught her that a man should never hit a woman-
Now her mother would like to add that you really shouldn’t ever hit anybody-
But I have taught her that a man should never hit a woman.
Consider my genes a mark of Cain;
You will suffer seven times whatever you do to her,
And she will not keep your secret:
You can’t make fire feel afraid.
I have been teaching her love all of her life,
And all that I ask is that you continue the lesson.
Love her.
Befriend her.
Protect her- be there when I can’t, and when my body gives up to the grave,
Let the grin that eternity carves into my face be a reflection of the peace that your love brings to her,
And we should get along just fine…

Since before her birth, Since before my spark took hold an","To the Boys Who May One Day Date My Daughter' by Jesse Parent is a declaration of a father's love and the lengths he'd go to protect his daughter. In the first lines of this poem the speaker addresses any boys who might, in the future, want to date his daughter. He has a number of rules and general pieces of advice he wants to impart to them. The parent tells one imagined boy that he has been training to kill him since before his daughter was born. This shocking statement is meant to be funny, but it also speaks to how serious the father is about his daughter's wellbeing. As the poem continues, the father describes the lengths he'd go to take care of his daughter and the fact that the “boy” does not stand a chance against him. He imagines the boy's fear of meeting him and encourages it. The speaker alludes, again, to the ease with which he could murder any miscreants who sought to harm her. As the poem progresses, the speaker addresses the fact that his daughter is eventually going to fall in love and he needs to make sure the chosen boy treats her well. He asks that any boy chosen by his daughter take care of her, protect her, love her, and “Befriend her”. The speaker tells the boy that if he can do these things that they'll get along just fine. 'To the Boys Who May One Day Date My Daughter' ends humorously with the speaker suggesting that all these rules and threats hold true for any girls who might want to date his daughter as well."

In this poem, the poetic persona or the poet himself talks directly with those who support euthanasia. The poet requests them not to end his life even if he requests them to do so. At some point in his life, he can act against his will. The speaker will ask for it. He might be willing to end that process of suffering somehow. Then they should not act according to his wish. As life is more important than death. At the end of the poem, the poet appeals to the “mercy killers”. All he wants is to let him glow."

Her school responds to this act swiftly and uncharitably. The principal sends her home, even though the hairstyle isn’t against the school’s rules, based on a trumped-up technicality. The decision seems arbitrary to Heidi and the people around her. The poem argues that Heidi isn’t being intentionally provocative or disobedient—rather, she’s grieving the death of her mother. The school’s punishment—and, more broadly, the way it wields its authority—thus seems cruel and capricious. The poem suggests that the school is primarily focused on power and control—and that such control requires stigmatizing and punishing any sign of difference."
1671,1682,1682,"Bare-handed, I hand the combs.
The man in white smiles, bare-handed,
Our cheesecloth gauntlets neat and sweet,
The throats of our wrists brave lilies.
He and I

Have a thousand clean cells between us,
Eight combs of yellow cups,
And the hive itself a teacup,
White with pink flowers on it,
With excessive love I enameled it
Thinking ""Sweetness, sweetness.""
Brood cells gray as the fossils of shells
Terrify me, they seem so old.
What am I buying, wormy mahogany?
Is there any queen at all in it?

If there is, she is old,
Her wings torn shawls, her long body
Rubbed of its plush—
Poor and bare and unqueenly and even shameful.
I stand in a column

Of winged, unmiraculous women,
Honey-drudgers.
I am no drudge
Though for years I have eaten dust
And dried plates with my dense hair.

And seen my strangeness evaporate,
Blue dew from dangerous skin.
Will they hate me,
These women who only scurry,
Whose news is the open cherry, the open clover?

It is almost over.
I am in control.
Here is my honey-machine,
It will work without thinking,
Opening, in spring, like an industrious virgin
To scour the creaming crests
As the moon, for its ivory powders, scours the sea.

He has nothing to do with the bee-seller or with me.
Now he is gone

In eight great bounds, a great scapegoat.
Here is his slipper, here is another,
And here the square of white linen
He wore instead of a hat.
He was sweet,

The sweat of his efforts a rain
Tugging the world to fruit.
The bees found him out,
Molding onto his lips like lies,
Complicating his features.

They thought death was worth it, but I
Have a self to recover, a queen.
Is she dead, is she sleeping?
Where has she been,
With her lion-red body, her wings of glass?

Now she is flying
More terrible than she ever was, red
Scar in the sky, red comet
Over the engine that killed her—
The mausoleum, the wax house","The queen is dead, the hive is bare, and the queen is alive.","'Stings' by Sylvia Plath describes the changes which come over a speaker as she contemplates the life of a queen bee inside an old hive. The poem begins with the speaker describing an interaction between herself and a bee-seller. This man is painted as her equal. She is showing an amount of bravery by not wearing gloves when handling the bees. The speaker wants to be on the same level as the professionally regarded man. The next section gives way to a bit of timidity. She is reminded of the fact that acting brave is not acting “sweet.” This brings a change in her demeanor. She begins to worry about the hive she has purchased. She sees its faults and wonders if there is even a queen inside it at all. If there is, she is very old. The speaker is clearly afraid of aging and becoming another “shawl” wearing woman. She also presents another side of her life. There is worry within her that she will lose the “strange-ness” which makes her original and become like the worker bees. She knows she is “no drudge” but fears it all the same. The poem progresses through the possibilities she faces in life until to comes to the point where she decides enough is enough. She will no longer fear the future and will instead embrace her own power as a human being. This change is signaled by the driving off of a “third person.” This is a man who has been following her and watching her throughout her life. He represents the pressures of modern life. He finally leaves her side, driven off by the bees which sacrifice themselves by stinging his lips. In the last section, she returns to her thoughts about the queen. She reiterates her concerns that the queen is not in the hive, but is quickly proven wrong when the bee bursts out and flies over the street. She is fully revealed in all her “red” glory. This movement represents the speaker's own feelings in regards to her change in perspective. She too is escaping the “mausoleum” in which she has lived her whole life.

Why is everyone jostling

Go home again, go home for today.

The following lines hype up the group's expectations for what they are going to see. This all comes to a head after they spend time traveling to the site and finding out the rabbit has escaped. He has found a way out of his enclosure and is now buried under the earth waiting to be found again."

The poem begins with the speaker stating the simple fact that “Things concentrate at the edges.” He uses a pond to illustrate his point. Around the edges of the pond, one can find beautiful things, such as “damask light” and also disheartening, “textile scum.” All parts of life wash up here and can be analyzed to see a fuller picture of one's life. In the second stanza, Wilbur's speaker compares the edges of life and their importance to human lives. The second stanza details how one can glimpse the edges while asleep, but how they slip away once conscious. Just like cricket sounds in a field, the edge is intangible. When it is gone one will notice even if it is not at the forefront of every day's thoughts. In the third stanza, the poet talks about riches and how human beings drift back in hope of a good drowning."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is back in a spot he used to know very well. It is beside a stream, under the boughs of a tree. He sits where he used to sit, and looks at all the familiar sights. It is as if he has returned to his youth, he is even inspired to engage with his old dreams. In the next lines, he takes note of the fish, swans, and overall peaceful ecosystem around him. The third stanza focuses on the coming on of evening. Just like he did when he was young, he has idled his time away on the stream's banks. The shadows of the evening are creeping up beside him. It is not a bad sight though, as he has the brightening moon to see by. The speaker wants to increase the peaceful nature of the scene even more. He decides to sing aloud his “old lament,” the same song he sang many years past. It contained all his hopes and dreams. Now, it is a way of engaging with one of the most important themes of the poem, nostalgia, on the deepest level possible."

Cummings is a beautiful expression of the power of love. Through simple language, Cummings conveys the idea that love is a force more powerful than forgetting. In the first two lines, Cummings talks about the strength of love: “love is more thicker than forget,” he writes. He defines the ever-changing and never-changing nature of love, its strength, its ability to defy bounds, its agelessness, and much more throughout the following stanzas. He uses numerous examples of figurative language to compare love to natural elements that make it at once harder and easier to understand."

The poet compares 'Romance' with two birds of totally different kind and nature. In the first part, 'Romance' is compared to a Paroquet (parakeet). He says that it taught him the alphabet in the wildwood, when he was still a child. At the same time, in the second stanza, the writer is older and the tone immediately changes when the condor is mentioned. This giant scary bird shakes the heavens and thunders by. The writer has no time for unimportant businesses, because, he knows that the condor is there, following him. The presence of the condor keeps him in control from whiling away his time on unimportant things. And even when he finds some free time, he can't spend it on the forbidden things, because his heart would feel it to be a crime."

with unusual poems and plays that she hunts out in crooked bookshops

The poem begins with the speaker asking a question. His friend wants to know what he finds most attractive in a girl. After some hesitation, the speaker replies, reading. He finds a girl who reads to be more attractive than a girl with big “tits” or a big “ass.” It is clear in the text that the speaker knows his answer is going to confuse his friends. The following lines are used to explain his preference. He goes through all the different reasons that he finds smart women attractive. The most important being, that they voracious consumers of information. Whether that be the back of a cereal box or books at Waterstones. He also adds towards the end of the poem that he's not immune to flirting and raunchiness. The speaker wants his friends to know that it's not just the act of reading that attracts him, he actually believes that it makes women more beautiful and sexier. The poem ends with a repetition of some of the most important lines and a final emphasis on the fact that “a girl… With passion“ is the most important thing to the speaker."

So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.
Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns

So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.

In 'Tears, Idle Tears', Alfred Lord Tennyson recollects the memory of his loved one after seeing the scenic beauty of Tintern Abbey. Each of the elements of the place reminds him of the person. After reading the poem, it becomes clear that the person he is thinking of is no more. In the poem, “the happy autumn-fields” makes the poet think of “the days that are no more.” The “sail”, glittering by the sunlight at dawn, seems to the poet that it may bring his friend from the curse of oblivion. In the “dark summer dawns”, the sweet song of the “half-awakened birds” is not soothing to the poet. It once gave the poet satisfaction as his friend was with him. The death of his beloved friend has changed everything. It has left the poet with the memories of the past in his sad heart. "

In a strange way, the very fact that things are transient is what makes them special. Williams relies on the fleeting nature of love, explaining the idea that love, at that moment, must be cherished. Indeed, there is only so much time living, so life and love must be enjoyed now."
1680,1691,1691,"All year the flax-dam festered in the heart
Of the townland; green and heavy headed
Flax had rotted there, weighted down by huge sods.
Daily it sweltered in the punishing sun.
Bubbles gargled delicately, bluebottles
Wove a strong gauze of sound around the smell.
There were dragonflies, spotted butterflies,
But best of all was the warm thick slobber
Of frogspawn that grew like clotted water
In the shade of the banks. Here, every spring
I would fill jampotfuls of the jellied
Specks to range on window sills at home,
On shelves at school, and wait and watch until
The fattening dots burst, into nimble
Swimming tadpoles. Miss Walls would tell us how
The daddy frog was called a bullfrog
And how he croaked and how the mammy frog
Laid hundreds of little eggs and this was
Frogspawn. You could tell the weather by frogs too
For they were yellow in the sun and brown
In rain.
Then one hot day when fields were rank
With cowdung in the grass the angry frogs
Invaded the flax-dam; I ducked through hedges
To a coarse croaking that I had not heard
Before. The air was thick with a bass chorus.
Right down the dam gross bellied frogs were cocked
On sods; their loose necks pulsed like sails. Some hopped:
The slap and plop were obscene threats. Some sat
Poised like mud grenades, their blunt heads farting.
I sickened, turned, and ran. The great slime kings
Were gathered there for vengeance and I knew
That if I dipped my hand the spawn would clutch it.",The flax-dam rotted in the heart of the townland; green an,"Context Born in 1939 County Londonderry (or Derry as it is more often referred to by Nationalists) Seamus Heaney is often known as a 'farmer poet' since many of his earliest poems are based on and around the farm and neighborhood where he was raised. 'Death of a Naturalist' appeared in his first major anthology of the same name, which was published in 1966. Heaney died in 2013, aged 74. Flax is the plant from which linen is manufactured. Sown in the spring, the plants were then harvested in summer. The plants were then bundled into sheaves and placed in a flax dam to 'rot'. The purpose of this was to rot the stems and expose the fiber within from which linen is made. A flam was a large pond, usually fed by an adjacent brook. The linen industry thrived in Northern Ireland until the mid-twentieth century when the advent of synthetic fabrics diminished its appeal. The word 'townland' is a colloquial term used to describe the farm and surrounding fields and land owned by the farmer. "

Ever changing, ever true --
I love April, I love you","April golden, April cloudy, Gracious, cruel, tender, rowdy; April","'Always Marry an April Girl' by Ogden Nash is a simple and effective poem in which the speaker discusses the attributes of a specific kind of woman. The speaker begins by expressing his gratitude that he's found “April” in his arms. This makes more sense as the lines go on. He's grateful that he's found a woman who demonstrates the attributes that he loves in women. He wants someone who resembles, in her attitudes and personality, the month of April. The following lines explain that this means she's at times golden and others cloudy. She's sometimes easy to get along with, and other times their relationship is more difficult. She's “roudy” and other adjectives. The poem concludes with the speaker stating that she is always changing but also always true."

Danez Smith
after Morgan Parker, after Wu-Tang
in the morning I think about money
green horned lord of my waking
forest in which I stumbled toward no salvation
prison made of emerald & pennies
in my wallet I keep anxiety & a condom
I used to sell my body but now my blood spoiled
All my favorite songs tell me to get money
I’d rob a bank but I’m a poet
I’m so broke I’m a genius
If I was white, I’d take pictures of other pictures & sell them
I come from sharecroppers who come from slaves who do not come from kings
sometimes I pay the weed man before I pay the light bill
sometimes is a synonym for often
I just want a grant or a fellowship or a rich white husband & I’ll be straight
I feel most colored when I’m looking at my bank account
I feel most colored when I scream ball so hard motherfuckas wanna find me
I spent one summer stealing from ragstock
If I went to jail I’d live rent-free but there is no way to avoid making white people richer
A prison is a plantation made of stone & steel
Being locked up for selling drugs = Being locked up for trying to eat
a bald fade cost 20 bones now a days
what’s a blacker tax than blackness?
what cost more than being American and poor?
here is where I say reparations.
here is where I say got 20 bucks I can borrow?
student loans are like slavery but not but with vacation days but not but police
I don’t know what it says about me when white institutions give me money
how much is the power ball this week?
I’mma print my own money and be my own god and live forever in a green frame
my grandmamma is great at saving money
before my grandfather passed he showed me where he hid his money & his gun
my aunt can’t hold on to a dollar, a job, her brain
I love how easy it is to be bad with money
don’t ask me about my taxes

Throughout the poem, Smith takes the reader into a speaker's thoughts, dreams and fears. This speaker, who could be Smith theirself, speaks on their obsessive focus on money. It haunts their days and nights through its necessity and ephemeral nature. Race, sex, and economics are tied together in almost every section of the poem. The speaker makes sure to go into striking and touching detail about the different challenges a black person faces when trying to raise themselves out of poverty than a white person does. Through personal depictions of want and need Smith's speaker alludes to a larger need to address the racial wealth gap, the prison-industrial complex, and make reparations to the black community."
1683,1694,1694,"Goosey goosey gander,
Whither shall I wander?


Upstairs and downstairs,
And in my lady’s chamber.


There I met an old man,
Who wouldn’t say his prayers,


So I took him by his left leg,
And threw him down the stair.","'Goosey goosey gander,' 'Whither","'Goosey goosey gander' is an entertaining nursery rhyme that details a man tossing another older man down a flight of stairs. The poem is separated into two parts, the first in which the speaker wanders through his home as though he's looking for something. He goes upstairs and downstairs and eventually makes his way into his lady's chamber. Then, he finds an old man who “wouldn't say his prayers” and throws him down the stairs. The poem ends abruptly without an explanation for these actions. This has led to several different interpretations, as discussed below."
1684,1695,1695,"Dark house, by which once more I stand
Here in the long unlovely street.
Doors, where my heart was used to beat
So quickly, waiting for a hand.
A hand that can be clasped no more –
Behold me, for I cannot sleep,
And like a guilty thing I creep
At earliest morning to the door.
He is not here; but far away
The noise of life begins again,
And ghastly thro’ the drizzling rain
On the bald street breaks the blank day.","A dark house, by which once more I stand Here in the long unlovely street","Dark house, by which once more I stand' by Alfred, Lord Tennyson describes the speaker's night as he seeks out the old joys of friendship. The poem begins with the speaker describing standing in front of the house of Arthur Hallam, the deceased friend for whom 'In Memoriam” was written. Tennyson, who is usually considered to be the speaker, is looking across the lawn at the house. It's dark inside. The experiences he used to have there are long since gone. They passed on alongside his friend. The speaker explains that he only ended up there because he couldn't sleep. It's very early morning and the sun is about to rise. Rather than adding a bit of light or hope to the scene, things only get worse. It begins to rain and the speaker has to resign himself to the fact that the house is not going to provide him with the solace it was previously imbued with."

The second half of the poem is spent destroying these landscapes as a wave sweeps away all of North America and even travels into Europe. The ending is ambiguous as to whether humankind will now exist in peace with the world or recreate their past.

In the first part of this poem, the speaker conveys her positive and loving relationship with her giving grandfather. She associates him with a number of everyday objects, like a watch. But, as he aged, he grew ill. Although the specific illness is never revealed, the speaker does describe how, as a child, she was confused why he separated himself from the rest of his family and spent long periods of time in his room alone. The poem ends with the suggestion that the grandfather did eventually pass away but that the speaker continues to love him."
1687,1698,1698,"To cure myself of wanting Cuban songs,
I wrote a Cuban song about the need
For people to suppress their fantasies,
Especially unhealthy ones. The song
Began by making reference to the sea,
Because the sea is like a need so great
And deep it never can be swallowed. Then
The song explores some common myths
But the Cuban people and their folklore:
The story of a little Carib boy
Mistakenly abandoned to the sea;
The legend of a bird who wanted song
So desperately he gave up flight; a queen
Whose strength was greater than a rival king's.
The song goes on about morality,
And then there is a line about the sea,
How deep it is, how many creatures need
Its nourishment, how beautiful it is
To need. The song is ending now, because
I cannot bear to hear it any longer.
I call this song of needful love my voice.","To cure myself of wanting Cuban songs, I wrote a Cuban song about the nee","Beginning My Voice with a focus on 'Cuban Songs', Rafael Campo tells about typical characteristics of these songs, focusing on the ideas, images and myths common in them. He talks of the 'sea', of the story of the 'Carib boy' lost to the sea, a bird who gave up flight and a 'queen' who was 'stronger' than the rival king. All these stories and ideas passed through each generation have become an integral part of Cuban culture, with Campo suggesting they lie inherently in everyone from the country. He summarises his 'Song' by actually revealing that it was his 'Voice' all along, suggesting that all this history is bound up in something as simple as his voice. He projects the voice as a symbol of national identity, proudly presenting his Cuban heritage through the concise poem."

Floats in the cemetery’s air,
Not planted in memoriam there,
But growing wild, uncultured, free.
 
A bird comes perching there to sing,
Winter and summer, proffering
Its faithful song—sad, bittersweet.
That tree, that bird are you and I:
 
You, memory; absence, me, that tide
And time record. Ah, by your side

To live again! But ma petite,
Now nothingness, cold, owns my flesh. . .
Will your love keep my memory fresh?","A tree floats in the cemetery’s air, Not planted in memory there, But","'Last Hope' by Paul Verlaine describes the love which exists between two people and how that love might be a way for the speaker to survive. In the first stanza, the speaker describes a “humble stone” that exists next to a “wild” tree in a cemetery. It grew there of its own accord, it was not placed there purposefully. He furthers the scene by speaking of a bird that perches in the tree, returning every season, and singing a “sad and bittersweet” song. These elements represent the love between the speaker and his unnamed companion and listener. In the second half of the poem, it becomes clear that the speaker has died and it is the love of the listener which is keeping him alive. He knows that there is no chance for him to live again, although he continues to hope for it. He asks that she never forget him as his memory will not cool and decay like his body."
1689,1700,1700,"You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?

Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

Weakened by my soulful cries?

The poem takes the reader through a series of statements the speaker makes about herself. She praises her strength, her body, and her ability to rise up and away from her personal and historical past. There is nothing, the speaker declares, that can hold her back. She is going to “rise” above and beyond anything that seeks to control her."

The speaker refers to himself as the Reaper at first, describing the way in which death takes life indiscriminately. Henley then goes on to have his speaker describe himself as the Sower, a giver of infinite life. The two powers are balanced out in the final stanza, making the speaker God-like in nature with the power to give and take at will. Life and Death are compared and described as being tangled together in nature, both crucial to the “ebb and the flood” of creation."

Moral: ""You mustn't.""","The fairy says I must not sleep, when I cried, when I wished to drink","‘My Fairy’ by Lewis Carroll is a work that is grounded in a hint of satire since a creature as light and playful as “a fairy” is utilized to represent a larger aspect of life that takes away possibilities and offers limitations. These limitations are often ridiculous, like not allowing Carroll to “laugh” or eat, and this overbearing concept speaks a great deal to Carroll’s frustration with the circumstance he is commenting on. As the work progresses, the possibility that Carroll is using this work as a means to comment on the structure of cultures and nations from political and legal aspects gains merit so that this tiny “fairy” seems to be speaking of the number of things we cannot do in order to hold to what was meant to be an elevated means of living. Essentially, just as this tiny “fairy” should not be so concerned with tedium and limitations, the structure we live in is more limiting than we might have noticed, and this is Carroll’s main theme."

In the first lines of 'Hope holds to Christ,' the speaker begins by noting that Hope, as a personified force, holds a mirror up to Christ. As the lines progress, it becomes clear that there's a relationship between Hope and Christ, and that reflects the other in the human mind. There, one can find a reflection of Christ even if Hope is not able to see it. It's this inability that closely resembles the need for faith. One must believe even if there is no reflection in the dim mirror."

For if it prosper, none dare call it treason.","The treason of a treason is never prospered, for","'Of Treason' by John Harington is a very short poem that expresses a truth about treason and control. The speaker poses a question in the first line (a rhetorical question). They proceed to answer this question in the next line. They're asking why treason doesn't “prosper” or why it leads to nothing but failure and death. The answer is that it's only called “treason” when it's unsuccessful. When it is successful, it results in a new leader/ruler, and saying anything against this person would be unwise. No one would “dare” call what was done “treason.”"

The speaker starts the lines describing her love, Bobby Shafto, and stating that he's gone to see. She hopes he'll return one day and marry her. Although there are few details in this song, it seems likely that Bobby may run into trouble that prevents him from getting back to the speaker. Plus, it's unclear if the love the speaker admits to is reciprocated. The second set of four lines adds more details to the story. It's clear the speaker admires Bobby's looks, repetitively returning to language that praises them. She declares that he's her love “for evermore” at the end of the nursery rhyme."

The poem, the title of which is an archaic word for “alarm,” reminds the reader of all that can and has been lost due to climate change. The speaker focuses on the concept of division and how there is so much separation between people in regard to the nature of the climate crisis and what can or should be done. The poet describes the immensity of what can and has been lost as well as how remembering the loss is important, but it's not the same as never losing the thing in the first place. Extinction is occurring at all times, and the alarm has to be rung continuously."

This poem begins with a reference to the “sweet day”. Though it is so cool, calm, and bright, in the eve its beauty fades away. A rose which bids a rash gazer wipe his eye, its root is embedded in one's grave. It means that the flower will also die in the future. Likewise, spring is also transient. The season comes for a short period of time each year. Then it bids goodbye to all. At the end of the poem, Herbert says the virtue of one's soul is everlasting. It chiefly lives even though the whole world turns to coal."

'Holy Innocents' by Christina Rossetti presents an image of a “little baby” who is sleeping. The speaker in the poem seems to be the baby's mother. To be specific it is not the case in the poem. In this poem, Christina uses the baby as a symbol of Jesus Christ. Whatsoever in the first stanza, the poet talks about the purity of a baby's soul. The “holy Angels” of heaven love a baby for its proximity with God, the creator. There is no evil spirit or beast which can harm a little baby. A man's spirit is so powerful at infancy that he is as powerful as the creator himself. That's why the baby has nothing to worry about. In the next stanza, Rossetti brings in the essential Christian elements in the poem. She resorts to them to advise the baby that Jesus Christ himself is protecting the holy spirits like him/her. The speaker, at last, tells the child that Christ is always with him/her while he/she is sleeping."

And they tell me you are brutal and my reply is: On the faces of women and children I have seen the marks of wanton hunger.
And having answered so I turn once more to those who sneer at this my city, and I give them back the sneer and say to them:
Come and show me another city with lifted head singing so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning.

The poet narrates what he observed and heard in the city. The speaker praises Chicago for its aesthetic nature and the flourishing industries. He portrays Chicago as a big, vibrant, and developing place. The poem begins with the poet addressing the city with different names which well suits its nature. The following lines are the arguments with 'They' those who criticize the negative aspects of the city. Though it looks like he agrees to whatever they say, in the later lines, he comes back at them with his observation of the city, highlighting all the positive sides of it. Despite Chicago being considered as a dangerous place to live in, the citizens are proud to be a part of this city because of its vibrancy, which reflects who they are."

You think I'm crazy, & like to say boyish
& outrageous things. No, there is

A train inside this iris.

It's a child's finger bearded in black banners.
A single window like a child's nail,

A darkened porthole lit by the white, angular face

Of an old woman, or perhaps the boy beside her in the stuffy,
Hot compartment. Her hair is silver, & sweeps

Back off her forehead, onto her cold and bruised shoulders.

The prairies fail along Chicago. Past the five
Lakes. Into the black woods of her New York; & as I bend

Close above the iris, I see the train

Drive deep into the damp heart of its stem, & the gravel
Of the garden path

Cracks under my feet as I walk this long corridor

Of elms, arched
Like the ceiling of a French railway pier where a boy

With pale curls holding

A fresh iris is waving goodbye to a grandmother, gazing
A long time

Into the flower, as if he were looking some great

Distance, or down an empty garden path & he believes a man 
Is walking toward him, working

Dull shears in one hand; & now believe me: The train

Is gone. The old woman is dead, & the boy. The iris curls,
On its stalk, in the shade

Of those elms: Where something like the icy & bitter fragrance

In the wake of a woman who's just swept past you on her way
Home

The poem begins with an exaggerated reference to an iris flower. According to the speaker, he finds a metaphorical “train” inside the flower. It consists of two passengers, one a grandmother and the other one is her grandson. The grandchild is the speaker of the poem. John writes this poem from his perspective. His speaker remembers the day when his grandmother left him by riding on the metaphorical train of life, leading one to death. After the incident, he broods over the iris flower and how it carries the old memories with his grandmother."

The poem expresses the speaker's belief that dogs live better, less encumbered lives than even the best of human beings do. He uses Gandhi and Thoreau as examples. What qualities do they have, the speaker wonders, that his dog doesn't? In the last lines, he outlines some of the things that are a little difficult about his dog. Then, he ends the poem with a powerful statement about his position in his dog's life."

The granddaughter says openly that she doesn't want to learn, but deep down only doesn't want to learn so she will need her grandmother's spirit for something once she is dead, keeping a connection to her family member. Similarly, the grandmother wants to teach her granddaughter about independence, but does this through a layer of teaching.

The poem begins with an extension of the title, expressing the narrator's gratitude for being awake as it meant he did not miss the ambiguous “it”. Much of the poem's intrigue stems from what this thing may be. Heaney employs his typically evocative poetic eye to the natural world around the narrator, notably the wind and its sounds. As the poem continues, it becomes clear that the narrator draws strength and inspiration from the power of nature, which emboldens them to continue living."
1704,1715,1715,"Mysterious death! who in a single hour
Life's gold can so refine
And by thy art divine
Change mortal weakness to immortal power!
Bending beneath the weight of eighty years
Spent with the noble strife
of a victorious life
We watched her fading heavenward, through our tears.
But ere the sense of loss our hearts had wrung
A miracle was wrought;
And swift as happy thought
She lived again -- brave, beautiful, and young.
Age, pain, and sorrow dropped the veils they wore
And showed the tender eyes
Of angels in disguise,
Whose discipline so patiently she bore.
The past years brought their harvest rich and fair;
While memory and love,
Together, fondly wove
A golden garland for the silver hair.
How could we mourn like those who are bereft,
When every pang of grief
found balm for its relief
In counting up the treasures she had left?--
Faith that withstood the shocks of toil and time;
Hope that defied despair;
Patience that conquered care;
And loyalty, whose courage was sublime;
The great deep heart that was a home for all--
Just, eloquent, and strong
In protest against wrong;
Wide charity, that knew no sin, no fall;
The spartan spirit that made life so grand,
Mating poor daily needs
With high, heroic deeds,
That wrested happiness from Fate's hard hand.
We thought to weep, but sing for joy instead,
Full of the grateful peace
That follows her release;
For nothing but the weary dust lies dead.
Oh, noble woman! never more a queen
Than in the laying down
Of sceptre and of crown
To win a greater kingdom, yet unseen;

To earn the true success --

The poem begins with the speaker relaying the basic features of her mother's life. She was old when she died, and her death came as a relief to all the family members. They knew she no longer had to bear the pain of living on her shoulders and were pleased she was going to heaven. In the next stanzas, the speaker takes the time to describe who her mother was and why she was such an important person. Abigail Alcott did everything she could to make the best life possible for her children. This included completing deeds which were both mundane and “heroic.” The poem concludes with the speaker asking that all those listening to seek to live the kind of life that she is now— one that is “royal.” Death should be proud it is able to take one's soul when that time comes."

The two might not be in the same location as the speaker is writing these words but they are together all the same. Their love spans any distance, as long as they are happy with one another.

Kumin's persona addresses this poem to her dear old friend, Anne Sexton. Throughout this piece, she shares how she feels while wearing her friend's old jacket. The first stanza captures the speaker putting on the jacket. Her friend's dog becomes ecstatic to see the jacket. She discovers the things kept in her pockets and shares how her heart aches for her dear one's absence. In the second stanza, the speaker tries to ruminate upon the memories of their friendship. She meditates upon a number of things starting from her friend's car to the rooms where her scent still lingered. In the last stanza, she describes how great her friend was. Her poetic voice won hearts. After her death, the speaker tries to jot down her remnants while wearing her “dumb blue blazer.”"
1707,1718,1718,"Back out of all this now too much for us,
Back in a time made simple by the loss
Of detail, burned, dissolved, and broken off
Like graveyard marble sculpture in the weather,
There is a house that is no more a house
Upon a farm that is no more a farm
And in a town that is no more a town.
The road there, if you'll let a guide direct you
Who only has at heart your getting lost,
May seem as if it should have been a quarry—
Great monolithic knees the former town
Long since gave up pretense of keeping covered.
And there's a story in a book about it:
Besides the wear of iron wagon wheels
The ledges show lines ruled southeast northwest,
The chisel work of an enormous Glacier
That braced his feet against the Arctic Pole.
You must not mind a certain coolness from him
Still said to haunt this side of Panther Mountain.
Nor need you mind the serial ordeal
Of being watched from forty cellar holes
As if by eye pairs out of forty firkins.
As for the woods' excitement over you
That sends light rustle rushes to their leaves,
Charge that to upstart inexperience.

A few old pecker-fretted apple trees.

Someone's road home from work this once was,
Who may be just ahead of you on foot
Or creaking with a buggy load of grain.
The height of the adventure is the height
Of country where two village cultures faded
Into each other. Both of them are lost.
And if you're lost enough to find yourself
By now, pull in your ladder road behind you
And put a sign up CLOSED to all but me.
Then make yourself at home. The only field
Now left's no bigger than a harness gall.
First there's the children's house of make believe,
Some shattered dishes underneath a pine,
The playthings in the playhouse of the children.
Weep for what little things could make them glad.
Then for the house that is no more a house,
But only a belilaced cellar hole,
Now slowly closing like a dent in dough.
This was no playhouse but a house in earnest.

A brook that was the water of the house,
Cold as a spring as yet so near its source,
Too lofty and original to rage.

Will leave their tatters hung on barb and thorn.)

Of an old cedar at the waterside

Under a spell so the wrong ones can't find it,
So can't get saved, as Saint Mark says they mustn't.

The speaker states from the beginning that he desires the death of his lover, that she would, now a spirit, come to him and “bend [her] head,” submitting to his will. She will become the person he wishes she was in life, in death. She will, he hopes, forgive him for the unexplained actions that turned her from him. He continues to state that in death she would no longer rise and “hasten away” from his touch as she does in life, but would submit to whatever he desired. She had the “will of wild birds in life,” but not in death. Her hair will be contained and bound within the stars and sky. It will not longer flow free, a symbol of female sexual freedom and liberation. He concludes by reiterating his desire, and saying that ideally his “beloved” would be interred beneath the “dock-leaves” in the ground."

Ramanujan speaks about history through an image-rich narrative about a family home. The poem begins with the speaker telling the reader that everything that comes into his house always stays. Or, if it leaves, it eventually comes back again. As soon becomes clear, the speaker really does mean everything. Some of the many “small-scale” things on his list are cows, “prostitute songs,” wives and soldiers, books, photographs, and cloth. Some of the most important things that come into the house, and stay there, are beliefs. In one example the speaker describes how the women are made to follow traditional gender roles and in another how a neighbor brought a dish of sweets for a god's wedding anniversary. Towards the end of the poem, the examples take a darker turn. The speaker starts to talk about war and the men in the family who have gone off to fight. One man went as far as the Sahara but came back “gnawed by desert foxes”. This seems like quite a depressing thing to have happen, but the second man the speaker mentions came back in body alone. He died while fighting and had a complicated route back to the house. Despite the distance, he did come home, and this is the main theme of the poem. That nothing is meaningless in a family. All its quirks, bits of trivia, and important history belong to the home and can't be separated from future generations."

This is made clear through the depiction of a thrush flying through the woods and “rins[ing] and wring[ing]” the world around it. The winter, and with it mistakes and sins, are washed away. The religious imagery continues to develop in the second stanza as the speaker directly addresses God. He asks that Christ make sure that the “innocent” children are saved from the sin that doomed the Garden of Eden."

The poem begins with the fading of the day into night. The poet persona notes this change as the universal indication working hours are over. As the poem progresses, however, he spots a sower still planting seeds in his fields. The sower's dedication to this activity intrigues him. The persona admires the man's diligence; he also senses the old sower only works till late out of necessity and pities him. In the poem's conclusion, the titular sower never leaves his fields, even when it becomes totally dark. Although the sower's figure is a distorted shadow at the end, out of admiration, the poet persona doesn't stop watching him either. "

In the first lines, the speaker begins by describing how the rising sun “crowned the hills” of the plains and displayed for the speaker, a “wondrous spectacle.” She was there to observe it amongst the leaves. This is later related to the beginning of her life. She was as beautiful and unbothered as the sunrise. As the poem progresses the scene only becomes lovelier. The warmth and light spreads across the field and the birds sing out, “heralding” the coming of morning. In the last lines, the speaker reminds her readers that the morning cannot last. Nothing this beautiful is without end. She also relates the coming of “sorrow's day” to the process of aging. The speaker is no longer the untroubled youth she was at the dawn of her life."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that a woman should do everything she can while she is young to take advantage of the love others want to give her. She will be more appreciated while she is young and beautiful. Therefore, she should “gather [her] rose-buds” or the things in life she needs, before time takes over. Once “Time” has made its mark on her, she will be lost to the happy possibilities of life. In the final sections, the speaker directly tells his female listeners that they need to marry as soon as possible. There is no time to waste being coy as one might end up alone."

The roofs of one more audience

Auden depicts the travels and struggles of a writer, likely Auden, forced to go on an American book tour. The poem takes the reader through the day to day existence of a speaker who is constantly traveling and talking about his own writing. He moves from city to city with great frequency. He has no time to get to know anyone or relax for even a moment. Before he knows it he's back on a plane and onto the next destination. This process is a terrible one and the people don't make it any better. Most of them are forgettable, warm, and accommodating. In 'On the Circuit' Auden also discusses his speaker's longing to return home and be in his New York apartment. This doesn't appear to be possible at the moment, as he's back on a plane and landing at a new destination as the poem ends. "

At first, Poe makes his point clear to the readers. He penned this rhyme for his beloved, Frances Sargent Osgood whose name is hidden in between the lines of the text. Employing the acrostic form, the poet hides the name in a specific order. However, in the text, the speaker urges his beloved to find her name. Her name to him is like a treasure. Moreover, it's a lucky charm that the poet wears at his heart. Thereafter the poet confuses readers by using a reference to the “Gordian knot”. Just before the confusion begins, Poe provides the way using which one can find the name. According to him, one has to “Search well the measure—/ The words—the syllables!” If they ignore the “trivialest point”, they may lose the way of finding the name."

The poem takes the reader through a speaker's emotional reaction to their “boy's” successful time playing the role of a solider. He was brave and wore his uniform proudly. The speaker describes how the boy “fought the fight,” and presumably, brought he victory back home. But, the last two stanzas darken the mood as the toll the fighting took on his mind is depicted. The poet uses metaphors and similes to compare the boy's mind to frayed fiddle strings and depict the damage that was done to his soul."

'War Photographer' by Carole Satyamurti begins with a description of a firmly edged photo-frame. It reminds the readers of the rigidity of war. Secondly, the poet presents a contrasting image of a few “sun-gilded girls” merrily passing their time in “champagne giggles”. In contrast, the small girl in the war-ridden area is already a mother and constantly fights the odds of life. Moreover, in the third stanza, the photographer describes how that girl died due to the explosion of the first bomb. At last, she points at the caption that tried to describe the inner message of the photograph. According to the person, it falsely presents the actual scenario for creating a mood of optimism.

It foretells Macbeth's state of mind before he enters into the plot. At first reading, this song arouses a sense of fear and disturbance in the mind. The three witches, one of the strategic dramatic devices used by Shakespeare in 'Macbeth', sing this song while making a potion to call the dark forces. This song introduces the ingredients that the witches are using to make this potion in their cauldron. Each element brings disturbance into the scene. Alongside that, those elements also act as symbols. However, the witches use the fillet of a fenny snake, newt's eye, frog's toe, bat's wool, dog's tongue, adder's fork, blind-worm's sting, lizard's leg, and owlet's wing to make this potion. In the second phase, they add some similar ingredients that, ironically, strengthen the dark-integrity of the solution."

The man strikes up a conversation with the ploughman who is going back and forth through the field with his team of horses. They talk first about the weather but quickly move on to the war and how it has changed the farmer's life. He tells the speaker that many from the area have gone to fight and ended up dying. His “mate” was one of them. If this hadn't happened, the farmer tells the speaker, then he would've been able to help the farmer move the tree. The speaker understands where the farmer is going with the conversation and adds that then, he would never have been able to sit down and they wouldn't have had the conversation.

Towards Alto, ten miles off. And he had not
Done less from Chilgrove where he pulled up docks. ’Twere best, if he had had 'a money-box’,
To have waited there till the sheep cleared a field
For what a half-week’s flint-picking would yield.

Since he left Christchurch in the New Forest, one

The poem begins with the speaker stating that hate is the overwhelming feeling that the Greeks feel for this one woman. They are not capable of experiencing any sort of empathy or understanding of her situation and the impossible non-choices that she faced. The greeks hate everything that she is, from how she looks to how she stands. Not only do they feel disdain for her appearance, but they also hate the fact that she is, or ever has been happy. They want her to feel nothing at all. In the last stanza, the reader finds out the one way that their hate might be relieved. This woman, who has been passed around her whole life and sold for her beauty, was born of a God, and was adored for it. All that has now passed and due to her own independent choices, the only way she might not be hated quite so completely is if she was dead. "

Throughout this poem, the poet takes the reader through a series of images that define the frog in different ways. In the first lines, he explains how the frog is important in the wider history of the earth. It was on the planet way before human beings were and now it is at the mercy of those same human beings in a dissection lab. Through graphic detail, the poet describes what dissection entails and then juxtaposes those terrible images with a grandiose vision of what a frog is and how it should be considered by human beings."

The speaker of this poem has spent a whole day wandering, “since dawn” and is now by the ocean. As he is in repose, a vulture begins to circle overhead, getting closer and closer. The creature is at first something to be feared, as a bearer of death, or a grim reaper but he speaks to it, explaining that his bones still work. He is not ready for death—yet. The bird flies away and the man feel remorse at the bird's disappointment in missing a meal, and in not getting to become part of such a beautiful animal. The speaker concludes the poem by daydreaming about what it would be like to see with a vulture's eyes and fly with it's wings. The bird becomes a representation of heaven, something not to be feared, but cherished. Death is no longer frightful, but promising, as the speaker wishes to transcend his own body and become more than he is."

from the stirring omens of the astrology column

in next to nothing in the driveway opposite,
one hand flat against her stomach, one
shielding her eyes to gaze up at a pale calf,

oyster-painted toenails of an outstretched foot

The poem begins with the speaker describing the past actions of a young girl in a bathing suit on the porch roof of a house. She was climbing up the house and the speaker is now able to feel and relay what the girl felt then. There was the warmth of the sun and the strain as she tried to reach up towards a window. Down below was the girl's friend, who she may or may not have been in love with. This second young girl was also barely dressed and was watching her friend make this climb. It is clear after a question posed by the speaker part of the way through the poem, that she is really interested in the way these two girls were growing. The climb of the house symbolized the hard passage from childhood to adulthood. In the next sections, the speaker describes a factory nearby. There, everything is dull and gray. A secretary watched the girls from the window and observed the last moments as the girl on the roof disappeared into the shadow of the house."
1733,1744,1744,"Did I hear the church-clock a few minutes ago,
I was asked, and I answered, I hardly did know,
 But I thought that I heard it strike three.
Said my friend then, ""The blessings we always possess
We know not the want of, and prize them the less;
 The church-clock was no new sound to thee.


""A young woman, afflicted with deafness a year,
By that sound you scarce heard, first perceived she could hear;
 I was near her, and saw the girl start
With such exquisite wonder, such feelings of pride,
A happiness almost to terror allied,
 She showed the sound went to her heart.""","I heard the church-clock a few minutes ago, I was asked, and I answere","Clock Striking' by Charles Lamb is a short poem in which one friend encourages another to show appropriate appreciation in life. The poem begins with the speaker telling the listener about a question. His friend wanted to know if he heard the clock striking. The speaker isn't sure if he did or not, and says so. In the next three lines, the friend tries to teach the speaker a lesson about gratitude. We don't know what it is like to not have something we do have, or, to want something that has always existed for us. In the second stanza of 'Clock Striking,” and the friend continues to speak. The friend provides the speaker and listener with a great example of sufficient gratitude for life's blessings. He recalls watching a deaf girl hear a church bell and the wonder and excitement she felt. It went to her heart and he thinks the speaker, and the whole of the human race, should be more like her."
1734,1745,1745,"WHEN stars are in the quiet skies,

Then most I pine for thee;

Bend on me then thy tender eyes,

As stars look on the sea!

For thoughts, like waves that glide by night,

Are stillest when they shine;

Mine earthly love lies hush’d in light

Beneath the heaven of thine.

Familiar watch o’er men,

When coarser souls are wrapp’d in sleep—

Sweet spirit, meet me then!

There is an hour when holy dreams

Through slumber fairest glide;

And in that mystic hour it seems

Thou shouldst be by my side.

I can but know thee as my star,

My angel and my dream;

The poem spends the majority of its lines focusing on the nature of the relationship between the speaker and his lover. These two people are clearly deeply in love with one another. The speaker describes how their love is so pure it can only be celebrated at night under the stars. He doesn't want to bring his thoughts into the light for fear that the mundanity and relative impurity of the day will harm them. He makes several comparisons between his thoughts, his love, and natural images, such as waves and stars. The poem ends with a great example of a refrain as the poet repeats the first four lines."
1735,1746,1746,"I work all day, and get half-drunk at night. Waking at four to soundless dark, I stare. In time the curtain-edges will grow light. Till then I see what’s really always there: Unresting death, a whole day nearer now, Making all thought impossible but how And where and when I shall myself die. Arid interrogation: yet the dread
Of dying, and being dead,
Flashes afresh to hold and horrify.
The mind blanks at the glare. Not in remorse —The good not done, the love not given, time Torn off unused—nor wretchedly because An only life can take so long to climb
Clear of its wrong beginnings, and may never; But at the total emptiness for ever,
The sure extinction that we travel to
And shall be lost in always. Not to be here, Not to be anywhere,
And soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true.
This is a special way of being afraid
No trick dispels. Religion used to try,
That vast moth-eaten musical brocade
Created to pretend we never die,
And specious stuff that says No rational being
Can fear a thing it will not feel, not seeing
That this is what we fear—no sight, no sound, No touch or taste or smell, nothing to think with, Nothing to love or link with,
The anaesthetic from which none come round.
And so it stays just on the edge of vision, A small unfocused blur, a standing chill That slows each impulse down to indecision. Most things may never happen: this one will, And realisation of it rages out
In furnace-fear when we are caught without People or drink. Courage is no good:
It means not scaring others. Being brave Lets no one off the grave.
Death is no different whined at than withstood.
Slowly light strengthens, and the room takes shape. It stands plain as a wardrobe, what we know, Have always known, know that we can’t escape, Yet can’t accept. One side will have to go.
Meanwhile telephones crouch, getting ready to ring In locked-up offices, and all the uncaring
Intricate rented world begins to rouse.
The sky is white as clay, with no sun.
Work has to be done.
Postmen like doctors go from house to house.","I work all day, and get half-drunk at night. Waking at four","Aubade' by Philip Larkin is a beautifully dark poem about the inescapable nature of death and humankind's moments of despair. Throughout this poem, Larkin's speaker takes the reader into his darkest thoughts, those he has early in the morning before the sun comes up. There, he thinks about his future and the fact that death is always right there at the edge of his life. There is nothing in the world that can soothe the fear of death, he says. Religion tried, but it's useless in the face of what's to come. The speaker also notes how it's in these moments, when there is so “drink” or friendly faces as distractions, that the reality of death sets in. It's going to come for you whether you whine about it or show courage in the face of it. The poem concludes with the speaker describing the first rays of light that make their way into his room. It takes shape around him while outside people go about their lives, each one with the knowledge of death in the corner of their eye."
1736,1747,1747,"I tried the soft stuff on holiday in Wales,
a mania of teadrinking and hairwashing,

the sour steam of cooling towers,
the alchemical taste of brewing.

fierce lovely water that marked me for life
as belonging, regardless.","I tried the soft stuff on holiday in Wales, a mania of teadrinking an","In many ways, poetry, such as Hard Water, is about identity. The reason its lovers can so easily appreciate such a vast array of available talent is that the individuality of each poet is strongly reflected in their work. This goes beyond simple observations of style (some posts rhyme while others do not, for instance), but is rather something that is fundamentally entrenched within every poem anyone writes; like all art, a writer’s poem has a piece of them embedded within.

Jean Sprackland’s Hard Water is largely about this identity. It is a poem filled with the “I” pronoun that is designed to paint a picture through the words of its narrator. It does this in a very poetic way, using metaphor, imagery, and structure to tell the reader who is speaking in a unique way. Heavily entrenched in English culture, as well as drawing inspiration from the natural world, Jean Sprackland’s work creates a highly detailed portrait out of only a few short verses to tell a rich story of feeling distant and belonging as one."

Garcia reflects on the brilliance of human life, moving through one quiet morning in his life. The poet rises earlier, following the smell of a 'ripe' 'melon' in the house. His life is still asleep, so he wanders through the house. The delicious scent of the melon combines with the soft morning light, creating a beautiful scene. Garcia simply moves through this scene, reflecting on how much he is enjoying his day. The final lines show that he doesn't fully understand life, but is glad that it has to lead him here. The poem is quiet in terms of both tone and events, Garcia basking in the new day."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is separated from the one he loves, the intended listener of the poem. While they are apart he is miserable. He languishes about, unsure what to do with himself. But, that's not quite true. It is revealed that its the speaker's own fault they are separate. He tells the listener not to ask him when he's going to come back as he doesn't know. The speaker is unable to resist the sexual urges plaguing his every waking moment. In the next quatrain, he asks the listener that she let him “fly” and explore these urges, which he refers to as “torments.” He thinks that seeking them out will take some of the pressure off his heart. These lines are comical in that it's clear the speaker has indulged more than once. He goes on to describe the listener's arms as the only place he finds real peace. But again, this doesn't stop him from ruining himself on the streets amongst those with “unblest” hearts. The poem concludes with the speaker admitting that he's likely never going to change."

By good angels tenanted,
Once a fair and stately palace—
Radiant palace—reared its head.

It stood there!
Never seraph spread a pinion
Over fabric half so fair!
Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
On its roof did float and flow

Time long ago)
And every gentle air that dallied,

Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,

Through two luminous windows, saw
Spirits moving musically
To a lute’s well-tunèd law,
Round about a throne where, sitting,
Porphyrogene!
In state his glory well befitting,
The ruler of the realm was seen.
And all with pearl and ruby glowing
Was the fair palace door,
Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing
And sparkling evermore,
A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty
Was but to sing,
In voices of surpassing beauty,
The wit and wisdom of their king.
But evil things, in robes of sorrow,
Assailed the monarch’s high estate;
(Ah, let us mourn!—for never morrow
Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)
And round about his home the glory
That blushed and bloomed
Is but a dim-remembered story
Of the old time entombed.
And travellers, now, within that valley,
Through the red-litten windows see
Vast forms that move fantastically
To a discordant melody;
While, like a ghastly rapid river,
Through the pale door
A hideous throng rush out forever,
And laugh—but smile no more.","The palace of the king was a gleaming palace, a palace of","'The Haunted Palace' by Edgar Allan Poe describes, through the metaphor of a palace, the physical effects of depression on the human mind. The poem begins with the speaker describing a majestic palace that is ruled over by “Thought.” He is the rightful king of this realm and his abode has yellow banners that fly above it, and two luminous windows through which “Wanderers” observe the interior goings-on. At first, the palace was grand and peaceful. Then, something unfortunate befalls it. It becomes clear that the palace is representative of a human head, and its degradation, of an onset of depression due to some unnamed “sorrow.”"

Milne is narrated from the perspective of a child who stops to think at the halfway point of a set of stairs. The poem is lighthearted and begins with the speaker describing how there is one particular step he enjoys sitting on. When he is going down the stairs he chooses to sit there and think. The step of his choice is one of a kind, there is no other like it. This is due to the fact that it falls directly in the middle of the staircase. It is positioned neither on the way up or on the way down. Therefore it provides him a wholly original and simulating place to think. Through his rather deep thoughts he realizes he is nowhere. He isn't going up the stairs nor is he going down, he is somewhere else entirely. This place is not named but it is a liminal space that represents transition and movement— often from one phase of life to another."

Milne is an engaging and image-rich poem that depicts a brief day out to the beach with Christopher Robin. In the lines of 'sand Between the Toes,' the speaker describes going to the beach on a very windy day. It sends sand everywhere, into their hair, and between their toes. There is a return, multiple times, to the power of the water and the wind and how they were drowning out all other sounds. Milne uses repetition in this poem to describe the scene in a way that truly emphasizes the sandy mess that the two characters got themselves into."

The poem begins with the speaker using a line from the Bible, specifically Psalm 119. Through this passage, he asks God why everything he does comes to nothing, but that which nonbelievers do is successful. He sees this as being very unfair. The next lines set out a possible scenario in which the speaker turned from God. He wonders if his situation would get worse or if everything would stay the same. There is clearly some doubt in his mind about God and his ability to influence the speaker’s life.

In the last lines, he specifically asks God that he be allowed, like the birds, to build something that lasts. Thus far everything he’s made in his life has come to nothing."

She is seeking to remind the reader of the worlds that we have created for ourselves, by alienating the one we were born into. The speaker and main character of this poem begins by describing the landscape through which she/he is driving. The speaker has a close call as she/he almost collides with a heron, an incident that affects her deeply. Clarke devotes much of the poem to create a contrast between nature and the town that is within it and then reminding the reader how we come from nature and are a part of it."

who goes to her table

The same night air

The same inky sky and pin-bright stars?
You can see nothing of her, but her head
bent over the page, her hand moving,
moving again, and her hair.
I wrote like that once.
But this is different:
This time, when she looks up, I will be there.","The young woman who climbs the stairs, who closes a child's door,","'Is it Still the Same' is a deeply introspective critique of poetic inspiration and the evolution of the artist over time. The poem begins with a series of questions regarding the identity of the poet's central figure, a woman who goes to a room to write, seemingly after putting a child to bed. The many questions create an uncertain tone, with the narrator either unsure or unwilling to offer clarity. As the poem progresses, it appears that the narrator may, in fact, be a later iteration of the writer, looking back on her past attempts to write. Ultimately, the narrator takes pleasure in the fact that they now have the benefit of experience and perspective, which she imagines will make writing easier in the future."
1752,1763,1763,"My pensive Sara! thy soft cheek reclined
Thus on mine arm, most soothing sweet it is
To sit beside our Cot, our Cot o’ergrown
With white-flowered Jasmin, and the broad-leaved Myrtle,
(Meet emblems they of Innocence and Love!)
And watch the clouds, that late were rich with light,
Slow saddening round, and mark the star of eve
Serenely brilliant (such would Wisdom be)
Shine opposite! How exquisite the scents
Snatched from yon bean-field! and the world so hushed!
The stilly murmur of the distant Sea
Tells us of silence.
And that simplest Lute,
Placed length-ways in the clasping casement, hark!
How by the desultory breeze caressed,
Like some coy maid half yielding to her lover,
It pours such sweet upbraiding, as must needs
Tempt to repeat the wrong! And now, its strings
Boldlier swept, the long sequacious notes
Over delicious surges sink and rise,
Such a soft floating witchery of sound
As twilight Elfins make, when they at eve
Voyage on gentle gales from Fairy-Land,
Where Melodies round honey-dropping flowers,
Footless and wild, like birds of Paradise,
Nor pause, nor perch, hovering on untamed wing!
O! the one Life within us and abroad,
Which meets all motion and becomes its soul,
A light in sound, a sound-like power in light,
Rhythm in all thought, and joyance everywhere—
Methinks, it should have been impossible
Not to love all things in a world so filled;
Where the breeze warbles, and the mute still air
Is Music slumbering on her instrument.
And thus, my Love! as on the midway slope
Of yonder hill I stretch my limbs at noon,
Whilst through my half-closed eyelids I behold
The sunbeams dance, like diamonds, on the main,
And tranquil muse upon tranquility:
Full many a thought uncalled and undetained,
And many idle flitting phantasies,
Traverse my indolent and passive brain,
As wild and various as the random gales
That swell and flutter on this subject Lute!
And what if all of animated nature
Be but organic Harps diversely framed,
That tremble into thought, as o’er them sweeps
Plastic and vast, one intellectual breeze,
At once the Soul of each, and God of all?
But thy more serious eye a mild reproof
Darts, O beloved Woman! nor such thoughts
Dim and unhallowed dost thou not reject,
And biddest me walk humbly with my God.
Meek Daughter in the family of Christ!
Well hast thou said and holily dispraised
These shapings of the unregenerate mind;
Bubbles that glitter as they rise and break
On vain Philosophy’s aye-babbling spring.
For never guiltless may I speak of him,
The Incomprehensible! save when with awe
I praise him, and with Faith that inly feels;
Who with his saving mercies healèd me,
A sinful and most miserable man,
Wildered and dark, and gave me to possess
Peace, and this Cot, and thee, heart-honored Maid!","Sara, a pensive woman, is a sweet and sass","In 'The Eolian Harp', Samuel Taylor Coleridge depicts images of nature to explore philosophical ideas. Throughout the poem, the lyrical voice will present opposite ideas and how these can be reconciled. Moreover, the poem deals with humanity's relationship with nature and the divine component found within nature itself. The lyrical voice will seek to understand the universe and what surrounds him. Therefore, in the poem, a dialog will be established between philosophical and religious matters, to understand the universe, and especially nature, in a deeper and better way. The lyrical voice's philosophical thoughts will collide with religion and he will experiment with a spiritual conflict, between the figure of god and nature."
1753,1764,1764,"Angelic minds, they say, by simple intelligence
Behold the Forms of nature. They discern
Unerringly the Archtypes, all the verities

Of sun from shadow where the trees begin,

Half-lyric lamb, a new loaf’s billowy curves,
Nor porridge, nor the tingling taste of oranges.

Guards us like air, from heavens too big to see;
Imminent death to man that barb’d sublimity

This parlour of the brain, their Maker shares
With living men some secrets in a privacy
Forever ours, not theirs.",An angel has no skin. They see the Form of Air; but mortals breathing it Drink,"On Being Human' by C.S. Lewis presents the differences between angels and human beings by using several images and metaphors. 'On Being Human' by C.S. Lewis beautifully talks about how the angels lack the essential qualities that humans possess throughout their lives. The angels, cherished with divine grace, can deduce the meaning of every form of life on earth by only using the slightest of their intelligence. In contrast, a human has a heart that can feel, and the mind to take pleasure in living. Angels can't get the sensual pleasures that rejuvenate the human soul. At last, the poet ironically refers to the illusory nature of the senses and glorifies the mind in which the trust between a man and the Almighty takes place. "

It can be found in the pinkness and whiteness of fruits and flowers, as well as in the stars of the dogwood tree. As the speaker goes on, the images combine and become less easy to distinguish. Merged together, they form an overall image of beauty and joy, as well as the faith it takes (as well as hope) for it to return in the midst of a rainstorm.

'The Dream' by Lola Ridge pictures how things have fallen apart. In her dream, she cannot visualize nature as it was before. The air which once gave the soothing sensation at the beginning of a new day feels like a “vapour of opium” now. The poet cannot breathe even in her dream for the breathlessness outside. The stately buildings or the “domes” filled with “sulphurous mist” choke her lungs in her dream. The sea, contaminated and deteriorating, has become still for the “Algal bloom“. And the sun emerging from the sea is not that pleasant to look at. Smoke from heavy industries has spread a pall around the dawning sun. It appears to Lola that the sun actually looks like a “junk of red iron/ guttering in sluggish-green water”. At last, the poet expresses her disappointment after seeing all this in her dream. "

In the first lines of 'I Dream a World,' the poet states that he's had a dream and that in it, all people are free. Love covers the earth and no one feels neglected or oppressed. Sweet freedom is known by every person all well. It is this freedom that allows peace and joy to bloom and spread. He specifically mentions race as an important factor when crafting this utopian world. He believes that a future exists in which race doesn't matter and that no one judges another person based on the color of their skin. Finally, he adds, wretchedness will hang its head and leave and joy will attend to the needs of all people."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that there is a river running through the different parts of a watermill. It is moving fluidly, as the poem does, passing through and over all obstacles. The water eventually leads to a dark pond. This is not somewhere one wants to be. Nevertheless, and much to the surprise of the speaker, there is a swan there. This one white creature is very out-of-place. So much so, it taunts the speaker with its chastity. In the next section, the landscape is described further and the speaker places herself within it. She is moving through the darkness like a “rook.” The poem concludes with the speaker addressing her intended listener. This person's image is frozen on her eyes, just like her hurt is within her heart. There is a frost over her whole being. It does not allow her to heal or move on."

The ballad discusses the conversation of a husband and wife, most likely looking out of their window as they follow the progression of an army marching from far, all the way to their house. This poem begins with the wife inquiring about the marching of the soldiers which “so thrills the ear” and concludes with her scared for her life as the army is so close now she can see their boots and their eyes burning with rage."
1759,1770,1770,"I climbed through woods in the hour—before—dawn dark.
Evil air, a frost—making stillness,
 
Not a leaf, not a bird—
A world cast in frost. I came out above the wood
 
Where my breath left tortuous statues in the iron light.
But the valleys were draining the darkness
 
Till the moorline– blackening dregs of the brightening grey –
Halved the sky ahead. And I saw the horses:
 
Huge in the dense grey –ten together –
Megalith—still. They breathed, making no move,
 
With draped manes and tilted hind—hooves,
Making no sound.
 
I passed: not one snorted or jerked its head.
Grey silent fragments
Of a grey still world.
 
I listened in emptiness on the moor—ridge.

Slowly detail leafed from the darkness. Then the sun
Orange, red, red erupted
 
Silently, and splitting to its core tore and flung cloud,
Shook the gulf open, showed blue,
 
And the big planets hanging—
I turned
 
Stumbling in a fever of a dream, down towards
The dark woods, from the kindling tops,
 
And came the horses.
There, still they stood,
But now steaming, and glistening under the flow of light,
 
Their draped stone manes, their tilted hind—hooves
Stirring under a thaw while all around them
 
The frost showed its fires. But still they made no sound.
Not one snorted or stamped,
 
Their hung heads patient as the horizons,
High over valleys, in the red levelling rays—
 
In din of the crowded streets, going among the years, the faces,

Hearing the horizons endure.",I climbed through woods in the hour—before—dawn dark. Evil,"'The Horses' by Ted Hughes presents the serene stillness of the horses and illustrates the scenic beauty of nature at dawn. 'The Horses' by Ted Hughes begins with the description of the natural landscape at dawn. The poet moved through the darkness of the woods to reach the hilltop. Thereafter he observed how darkness wrapped the valleys below. From there, he suddenly noticed a group of ten horses standing together. They didn't make any movements. Moreover, when the sun came out in the sky the poet started his journey downhill. On the way, he arrived at the place where the horses were. In the second but close encounter with those creatures, he sensed a calm stillness in them. This scene along with the curlew's call made him so elevated that he had stumbled while he was descending from the hill. However, at last, the poet says he revisits this memory often as it still soothes his soul."

The poem begins with the dying lover describing great happiness towards the end of their life. This first speaker says that they could not die until they saw their lover for the last time. They found one another again against all odds. It makes them both very happy that they are able to look and touch one another one more time. This person was seeking reassurance that the two will be able to find one another after they die. In the second stanza the speaker replies to these words. He does provide the reassurance this person was seeking. His words are calming and confident. He knows that if they are separated at this point in life, that the great “rondure” will push them together again. They are a part of the circular cycle of life and death and this is nothing to be afraid of."

This is why the speaker expresses her anger and frustration at the proposed peace deal. She explains how there could be no peace with the enemy (Austria) rooted in their soil. The peace promised to the people can only be achieved when they are totally free and the enemy is expelled from their country.

It is made up of nine stanzas of varying lengths. The refrains used throughout the poem act as a sort of chorus adding to the poem's musical-like quality. The tone of the poem is comedic, due to the constant use of colloquialism mirroring the language used by Indian people that reside in Britain."
1768,1779,1779,"Down the long hall she glistens like a star,
The foam-born mother of Love, transfixed to stone,
Yet none the less immortal, breathing on.

When first the enthralled enchantress from afar
Dazzled mine eyes, I saw not her alone,
Serenely poised on her world-worshipped throne,
As when she guided once her dove-drawn car,—
But at her feet a pale, death-stricken Jew,
Her life adorer, sobbed farewell to love.
Here Heine wept! Here still he weeps anew,
Nor ever shall his shadow lift or move,
While mourns one ardent heart, one poet-brain,
For vanished Hellas and Hebraic pain.","The foam-born mother of Love, transfixed to stone, Yet none the less immortal,","'Venus of the Louvre' by Emma Lazarus describes the sights seen and emotions experienced by a narrator who is visiting the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. The poem begins with the speaker giving an overview of what it's like to see the Venus de Milo. She has a light of her own that “glistens like a star.” The statue is positioned at the end of a hall where “Time's brutal hand” can not “mar” her. In the next section, the poem switches to a first person narration in which the speaker describes what happened when she saw the statue. Her experiences were a little different. She saw in her mind the image of Heinrich Heine, the long-deceased German poet, kneeling and weeping at the Versus' feet. He represents the general mourning of the Jewish people over “Hebraic pain.” The speaker starts that he is always going to be there until no heart mourns."
1769,1780,1780,"There's sunshine in the heart of me,
My blood sings in the breeze;
The mountains are a part of me,
I'm fellow to the trees.
My golden youth I'm squandering,
Sun-libertine am I;
A-wandering, a-wandering,
Until the day I die.

I was once, I declare, a Stone-Age man,
And I roomed in the cool of a cave;
I have known, I will swear, in a new life-span,
The fret and the sweat of a slave:
For far over all that folks hold worth,
There lives and there leaps in me
A love of the lowly things of earth,
And a passion to be free.

To pitch my tent with no prosy plan,
To range and to change at will;
To mock at the mastership of man,
To seek Adventure's thrill.
Carefree to be, as a bird that sings;
To go my own sweet way;
To reck not at all what may befall,
But to live and to love each day.

To make my body a temple pure
Wherein I dwell serene;
To care for the things that shall endure,
The simple, sweet and clean.
To oust out envy and hate and rage,
To breathe with no alarm;
For Nature shall be my anchorage,
And none shall do me harm.

To shun all lures that debauch the soul,
The orgied rites of the rich;
To eat my crust as a rover must
With the rough-neck down in the ditch.
To trudge by his side whate'er betide;
To share his fire at night;
To call him friend to the long trail-end,
And to read his heart aright.

To scorn all strife, and to view all life
With the curious eyes of a child;
From the plangent sea to the prairie,
From the slum to the heart of the Wild.
From the red-rimmed star to the speck of sand,
From the vast to the greatly small;
For I know that the whole for good is planned,
And I want to see it all.

To see it all, the wide world-way,
From the fig-leaf belt to the Pole;
With never a one to say me nay,
And none to cramp my soul.
In belly-pinch I will pay the price,
But God! let me be free;
For once I know in the long ago,
They made a slave of me.

In a flannel shirt from earth's clean dirt,
Here, pal, is my calloused hand!
Oh, I love each day as a rover may,
Nor seek to understand.
To enjoy is good enough for me;
The gipsy of God am I;
Then here's a hail to each flaring dawn!
And here's a cheer to the night that's gone!
And may I go a-roaming on
Until the day I die!

Then every star shall sing to me
Its song of liberty;
And every morn shall bring to me
Its mandate to be free.
In every throbbing vein of me
I'll feel the vast Earth-call;

Every once in a while, the bustle and hassle of the modern world, of all of the things going on in our lives, becomes too much to handle properly, and in those times, the best thing to do is usually to get away, if possible. This is true of the present day; it is also true of 1912, the year in which Robert Service published Rhymes of a Rolling Stone and the poem that likely inspired its title, ‘A Rolling Stone,’ in which Service reflects on the simple idea of getting away from the convoluted machinations of the modern world."

Lovecraft celebrates the eve of Christmas and the beauty of the nocturnal landscape. H.P. Lovecraft begins with the image of the cottage hearth beaming warmly and brightly.

Staring at the sky, he feels as if there is magic in the night sky that is only meant for gladdening the passing year. Suddenly, the sound from the belfries growing louder gradually, reminds the poet, “Christmastide is here!”"

And one of its notes had lost its tongue,
and holes were worn in both the treadles
where the organist’s feet, in grey, woollen socks
and leather-soled shoes, had pedalled and pedalled.

But its hummed harmonics still struck a chord:
for a hundred years that organ had stood
by the choristers’ stalls, where father and son,
each in their time, had opened their throats
and gilded finches – like high notes – had streamed out.

Although there is no formal rhyming pattern, rhyme is used frequently throughout the poem and this helps give 'Harmonium' a light, happy feeling. Although there are wistful, perhaps regretful undertones to this poem it is generally quite an uplifting piece. The rhymes and the colloquialisms help to accomplish this."
1772,1783,1783,"In late winter
I sometimes glimpse bits of steam coming up from
some fault in the old snow
and bend close and see it is lung-colored and put down my nose
and know
the chilly, enduring odor of bear.
I take a wolf’s rib and whittle
it sharp at both ends
and coil it up
and freeze it in blubber and place it out on the fairway of the bears.
And when it has vanished
I move out on the bear tracks,
roaming in circles
until I come to the first, tentative, dark splash on the earth.

dragging myself forward with bear-knives in my fists.
On the third day I begin to starve,
at nightfall I bend down as I knew I would at a turd sopped in blood,
and hesitate, and pick it up,
and thrust it in my mouth, and gnash it down, and rise
and go on running.
On the seventh day,
living by now on bear blood alone,
I can see his upturned carcass far out ahead, a scraggled, steamy hulk,
the heavy fur riffling in the wind.
I come up to him
and stare at the narrow-spaced, petty eyes, the dismayed
face laid back on the shoulder, the nostrils
flared, catching
perhaps the first taint of me as he
died.
I hack
a ravine in his thigh, and eat and drink, and tear him down his whole length
and open him and climb in
and close him up after me, against the wind,
and sleep.
And dream
of lumbering flatfooted
over the tundra,
stabbed twice from within,
splattering a trail behind me,
splattering it out no matter which way I lurch,
no matter which parabola of bear-transcendence, which dance of solitude I attempt,
which gravity-clutched leap,
which trudge, which groan.
Until one day I totter and fall—
fall on this
stomach that has tried so hard to keep up, to digest the blood as it leaked in,
to break up
and digest the bone itself: and now the breeze blows over me, blows off
the hideous belches of ill-digested bear blood and rotted stomach
and the ordinary, wretched odor of bear,
blows across
my sore, lolled tongue a song
or screech, until I think I must rise up and dance. And I lie still.
I awaken I think. Marshlights
reappear, geese
come trailing again up the flyway.
In her ravine under old snow the dam-bear
lies, licking
lumps of smeared fur
and drizzly eyes into shapes
with her tongue. And one
hairy-soled trudge stuck out before me,
the next groaned out,
the next,
the next,

wandering: wondering

In the first part of this poem, the speaker describes setting a creative and deadly trap for a bear. He's a solitary hunter who freezes a sharpened wolf bone in a piece of blubber. After the bear eats it, he follows the creature across the frozen planes of his landscape, suffering as his prey does. The hunter begins to starve and turns to a terrible and unusual source of food in order to survive. Finally, the bear dies, and he's able to eat from its corpse. He climbs inside to take shelter from the wind. The hunter dreams of living life as the bear did and experiencing his own death. The poem concludes with a hunter waking up and feeling unsure whether or not he is still dreaming. He maintains some of the attributes of a bear and some of a man, meditating on the nature of life."

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker looks back on her emotions regarding her upcoming wedding ceremony. She believed it was going to be something small, held in a forgotten city. When the ceremony finally came along, it was as expected—dull. When the guests arrived, their suitcases initiated an extended metaphor that gives the poem its deepest meaning. The poet uses numerous examples of similes depicting the wedding guest as beggars and smugglers. For her dowery, the speaker offers a smile, whisper, and more intangible things. She rides down the street with her groom, and they look in front of themselves as though they have the power to look through their closest surroundings and into another realm of existence. Here, the poem's dream-like powers are at their peak. In conclusion, the speaker says that she would prefer to marry the country of Pakistan itself. She imagines the various elements of the country becoming her dress and veil. Her dreams are temporary, and she knows that holding onto them is going to be impossible. The bride and groom face one another, and the speaker describes the markings on their hands as appearing like maps."

The poem starts with the speaker considering a sound. It's later revealed to be the sound of the first breath they and the person they're in a relationship with (also the person to whom the poem is directed) took together. When the sound comes, the room shakes, the speaker is reminded of their past together and inspired to question the listener about it. They wonder how and why they turned away from it and to it as well what exactly it signified. The “stance” they took is also up for consideration. The title “It is here” is used in the last line as if bringing the poem full circle."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that she remembers the sounds of a town. Her relationship with this place is unclear, but she describes it in vivid detail. The surf is compared to physical “fumbling” on a beach and the “yellow” as resembling “sulphur.” These choices paint the landscape as being deeply personal to the speaker. She has her own connections to the place that influence how she sees it. The following lines expand on the physical landscape that surrounds the speaker and her companion. She recalls their moments together underneath the ever-present nature of the moon, and around the flinging sea. Their time together is temporary, a fact which is presented through the passage of the night, tides, and the past tense structure of the piece."

By using the shape of a bird's wings, the poet is able to emphasize the nature of the fall and rise the speaker is experiencing. The poem begins with the speaker addressing the creation of humankind, specifically Adam. He describes the man's foolishness and how he threw away everything good that God gave him. It is because of this person's choice that the speaker suffers today. But, he's not content to stay that way. He asks God throughout this poem to allow him to rise out of the darkness and into the light."

In the first stanza of 'All Hallows,' the speaker focuses on the fields surrounding a farmhouse. They've been harvested to their fullest extent, the oxen rest, and the moon rises over the scene. It's described as “toothed,” a poignant depiction that helps remind the reader of the overall mood the poet is looking for. In the next stanza, she moves inside the home and describes a woman, with her arm extended outside the window, offering payment to the spirits of the world. She calls out to the night, asking her “little one” to come to her. The final line of the poem describes a child creeping from a tree, returning to its mother's arms."
1778,1789,1789,"All thoughts, all passions, all delights,
Whatever stirs this mortal frame,
All are but ministers of Love,
And feed his sacred flame.

Oft in my waking dreams do I
Live o'er again that happy hour,
When midway on the mount I lay,
Beside the ruined tower.

The moonshine, stealing o'er the scene
Had blended with the lights of eve;
And she was there, my hope, my joy,
My own dear Genevieve!

She leant against the arm{'e}d man,
The statue of the arm{'e}d knight;
She stood and listened to my lay,
Amid the lingering light.

Few sorrows hath she of her own,
My hope! my joy! my Genevieve!
She loves me best, whene'er I sing
The songs that make her grieve.

I played a soft and doleful air,
I sang an old and moving story—
An old rude song, that suited well
That ruin wild and hoary.

She listened with a flitting blush,
With downcast eyes and modest grace;
For well she knew, I could not choose
But gaze upon her face.

I told her of the Knight that wore
Upon his shield a burning brand;
And that for ten long years he wooed
The Lady of the Land.

I told her how he pined: and ah!
The deep, the low, the pleading tone
With which I sang another's love,
Interpreted my own.

She listened with a flitting blush,
With downcast eyes, and modest grace;
And she forgave me, that I gazed
Too fondly on her face!

But when I told the cruel scorn
That crazed that bold and lovely Knight,
And that he crossed the mountain-woods,
Nor rested day nor night;

That sometimes from the savage den,
And sometimes from the darksome shade,
And sometimes starting up at once
In green and sunny glade,—

There came and looked him in the face
An angel beautiful and bright;
And that he knew it was a Fiend,
This miserable Knight!

And that unknowing what he did,
He leaped amid a murderous band,
And saved from outrage worse than death
The Lady of the Land!

And how she wept, and clasped his knees;
And how she tended him in vain—
And ever strove to expiate
The scorn that crazed his brain;—

And that she nursed him in a cave;
And how his madness went away,
When on the yellow forest-leaves
A dying man he lay;—

His dying words—but when I reached
That tenderest strain of all the ditty,
My faltering voice and pausing harp
Disturbed her soul with pity!

All impulses of soul and sense
Had thrilled my guileless Genevieve;
The music and the doleful tale,
The rich and balmy eve;

And hopes, and fears that kindle hope,
An undistinguishable throng,
And gentle wishes long subdued,
Subdued and cherished long!

She wept with pity and delight,
She blushed with love, and virgin-shame;
And like the murmur of a dream,
I heard her breathe my name.

Her bosom heaved—she stepped aside,
As conscious of my look she stepped—
Then suddenly, with timorous eye
She fled to me and wept.

She half enclosed me with her arms,
She pressed me with a meek embrace;
And bending back her head, looked up,
And gazed upon my face.

'Twas partly love, and partly fear,
And partly 'twas a bashful art,
That I might rather feel, than see,
The swelling of her heart.

I calmed her fears, and she was calm,
And told her love with virgin pride;
And so I won my Genevieve,
My bright and beauteous Bride.","All thoughts, all passions, all delights, Whatever stirs this mortal frame, All","Love' by Samuel Taylor Coleridge details the emotional and physical relationship between a speaker and the woman he woos through storytelling. The poem begins with the speaker describing how love is the most important of the emotions. It is connected to all other emotions and experiences. There is one particular person the speaker is thinking of: a woman named Genevieve. He spends the majority of this piece relaying to the reader how he wooed Genevieve. It took time, and the influence of a loving and sorrowful story to bring her to him. The story he tells is contained within ten stanzas and details the love a knight feels for “The Lady of the Land.” She does not reciprocate at first and it drives him mad. He travels throughout the country but is unable to shake off her image and presence. Eventually, he comes upon a group attempting to rape a woman. The woman turns out to the be “Lady” the knight loves. He saves her, but is mortally wounded. The Lady has learned to love him though and is deeply upset by his death. It is the sorrow of the story that turns Genevieve towards the speaker. The two embrace and the speaker declares that she became his wife."

The Church collects devotional lyrics that portray religious experiences and the attempt of achieving a faithful life. Moreover, Love is a central problem in The Church, as George Herbert analyses and dramatizes different forms of it.

Love (III) is part of a sequence of three poems, which meditate on the nature of love. Love (I) and Love (II) focus on earthly love and how it tends to attract more attention than holy love. Particularly, Love (I) looks into the relationship between mortal and immortal love, and Love (II) explores the connection between divine love and human lust. However, Love (III) concentrates on sacred love by personifying love in a dialogue between a worshiper and God. Here, God is seen as an inviting lover that explains the worthiness of Love."

To live in Wales means to be aware of the “spilled blood”. This means that the people of Wales know that they have lost many men at war. Thus, “spilled blood” serves as a metaphor to talk about Welsh people and their history. This “spilled blood”, as part of their history, is everywhere around them: “That went into the making of the wild sky,/Dyeing the immaculate rivers/In all their courses”. The lyrical voice emphasizes the loss of life during battles and uses a tone of pessimism, uneasiness, and pain. Moreover, to “live in Wales” also means to be part of the rural Welsh tradition: “Above the noisy tractor/And hum of the machine/Of strife in the strung woods”. The lyrical voice portrays rural imagery in order to accentuate the description of the daily life in Wales and the agricultural setting. Yet, the poem shifts its tone and criticizes Wales hardly: “You cannot live in the present,/At least not in Wales”. The lyrical voice enumerates a succession of actions that cause this inability to live in the present. By using the second person (“you”), the lyrical voice is trying to gain the attention of the reader. First, the language is mentioned and appears to be strange, even for Welsh people: “The soft consonants/Strange to the ear”. The lyrical voice wants to emphasize that it is unfortunate that Welsh seems a strange language. Everything seems strange, even for those who live there: “There are cries in the dark at night/As owls answer the moon,/And thick ambush of shadows/ Hushed at the fields' corners.”. That is because there is no present, nor future in Wales, just the unforgettable events of the past (“There is no present in Wales,/And no future;/There is only the past”). The past of Wales is filled with leftovers, with things that are defective and partial. Notice that the lyrical voice says that there is only past in Wales, filled with “Brittle with relics,/ Wind-bitten towers and castles/ With sham ghosts;”. There is an imagery of decay that expresses all the suffering from the past. Instead of a glorious past, Wales has these poor images that portray the absence of a strong tradition. Most importantly, the lyrical voice emphasizes on the people: “And an impotent people,/Sick with inbreeding,/Worrying the carcase of an old song”. These final lines accentuate the lyrical voice's worry for the inhabitants of Wales. They are described as “impotent”, “sick”, and worried about “an old song”. This means that, instead of worrying about the present or future, the people of Wales are stuck in a painful past full of vestiges. The lyrical voice has a pessimistic tone in these last lines as the people of Wales are described and it seems as there isn't hope for their country if they continue to be attached to their past in a painful way."

Down and away below!
Now my brothers call from the bay,
Now the great winds shoreward blow,
Now the salt tides seaward flow;
Now the wild white horses play,
Champ and chafe and toss in the spray.

This way, this way!
Call her once before you go—
Call once yet!
In a voice that she will know:
""Margaret! Margaret!""
Children's voices should be dear

Children's voices, wild with pain—
Surely she will come again!
Call her once and come away;
This way, this way!
""Mother dear, we cannot stay!
The wild white horses foam and fret.""
Margaret! Margaret!
Come, dear children, come away down;
Call no more!
One last look at the white-wall'd town
And the little grey church on the windy shore,
Then come down!
She will not come though you call all day;
Come away, come away!
Children dear, was it yesterday
We heard the sweet bells over the bay?
In the caverns where we lay,
Through the surf and through the swell,
The far-off sound of a silver bell?
Sand-strewn caverns, cool and deep,
Where the winds are all asleep;
Where the spent lights quiver and gleam,
Where the salt weed sways in the stream,
Where the sea-beasts, ranged all round,
Feed in the ooze of their pasture-ground;
Where the sea-snakes coil and twine,
Dry their mail and bask in the brine;
Where great whales come sailing by,
Sail and sail, with unshut eye,
Round the world for ever and aye?
When did music come this way?
Children dear, was it yesterday?
Children dear, was it yesterday
(Call yet once) that she went away?
Once she sate with you and me,
On a red gold throne in the heart of the sea,
And the youngest sate on her knee.
She comb'd its bright hair, and she tended it well,
When down swung the sound of a far-off bell.
She sigh'd, she look'd up through the clear green sea;
She said: ""I must go, to my kinsfolk pray
In the little grey church on the shore to-day.
'T will be Easter-time in the world—ah me!
And I lose my poor soul, Merman! here with thee.""
I said: ""Go up, dear heart, through the waves;
Say thy prayer, and come back to the kind sea-caves!""
She smiled, she went up through the surf in the bay.
Children dear, was it yesterday?
Children dear, were we long alone?
""The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan;
Long prayers,"" I said, ""in the world they say;
Come!"" I said; and we rose through the surf in the bay.
We went up the beach, by the sandy down
Where the sea-stocks bloom, to the white-wall'd town;
Through the narrow paved streets, where all was still,
To the little grey church on the windy hill.
From the church came a murmur of folk at their prayers,
But we stood without in the cold blowing airs.
We climb'd on the graves, on the stones worn with rains,
And we gazed up the aisle through the small leaded panes.
She sate by the pillar; we saw her clear:
""Margaret, hist! come quick, we are here!
Dear heart,"" I said, ""we are long alone;
The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan.""
But, ah, she gave me never a look,
For her eyes were seal'd to the holy book!
Loud prays the priest; shut stands the door.
Come away, children, call no more!
Come away, come down, call no more!
Down, down, down!
Down to the depths of the sea!
She sits at her wheel in the humming town,
Singing most joyfully.
Hark what she sings: ""O joy, O joy,
For the humming street, and the child with its toy!
For the priest, and the bell, and the holy well;
For the wheel where I spun,
And the blessed light of the sun!""
And so she sings her fill,
Singing most joyfully,
Till the spindle drops from her hand,
And the whizzing wheel stands still.
She steals to the window, and looks at the sand,
And over the sand at the sea;
And her eyes are set in a stare;
And anon there breaks a sigh,
And anon there drops a tear,
From a sorrow-clouded eye,
And a heart sorrow-laden,
A long, long sigh;
For the cold strange eyes of a little Mermaiden
And the gleam of her golden hair.
Come away, away children
Come children, come down!
The hoarse wind blows coldly;
Lights shine in the town.
She will start from her slumber
When gusts shake the door;
She will hear the winds howling,
Will hear the waves roar.
We shall see, while above us
The waves roar and whirl,
A ceiling of amber,
A pavement of pearl.
Singing: ""Here came a mortal,
But faithless was she!
And alone dwell for ever
The kings of the sea.""
But, children, at midnight,
When soft the winds blow,
When clear falls the moonlight,
When spring-tides are low;
When sweet airs come seaward
From heaths starr'd with broom,
And high rocks throw mildly
On the blanch'd sands a gloom;
Up the still, glistening beaches,
Up the creeks we will hie,
Over banks of bright seaweed
The ebb-tide leaves dry.
We will gaze, from the sand-hills,
At the white, sleeping town;
At the church on the hill-side—
And then come back down.

The poem begins with the speaker describing how it's time for him and his children to swim back to their underwater home. They've had to accept that their wife and mother, a human woman, has abandoned them to return to humanity and a Christian life. The merman describes what happened, how she felt as though she was going to be damned unless she went to Easter service, and how she never came back from the small grey church. They tried to retrieve her, but she had no interest in even speaking to them."

Palmer, a realist landscape painter born in the early 1800s, is compared to Chagall, an early modernist known for his dreamlike scenes of Jewish life. Further along in the poem, in the beginning of stanza two, Jennings brings Picasso, the leader of the cubist movement, and Blake, the writer, painter, and illustrator into the poem. The poem begins with the speaker comparing the hearts and minds of Palmer and Chagall. She speaks directly to them and then turns her attention to Blake and Picasso. The speaker then begins to assert her own philosophy of art, declaring that “great qualities” are what makes great art possible. She speaks on the quiet she feels in the art that is filled with strange subdued scenes that create the wildest dreams. Jennings ends the poem by describing the one thing that she, or at least her speaker, believes worlds of art are built from, love. You can be read in full Samuel Palmer and Chagall here."
1783,1794,1794,"They lived enamoured of the lovely moon,
The dawn and twilight on their gentle lake.
Then Passion marvellously born did shake
Their breast and drave them into the mid-noon.
Their lives did shrink to one desire, and soon
They rose fire-eyed to follow in the wake
Of one eternal thought,—when sudden brake
Their hearts. They died, in miserable swoon.
Of all their agony not a sound was heard.
The glory of the Earth is more than they.

And over moving ocean-waves the bird
Chases his shadow and is no more seen.","The moon, the dawn and twilight on their gentle lake, the moon,","'They Lived Enamoured of the Lovely Moon” by Trumbull Stickney speaks of the brief life of two lovers and their love's small impact on the entire magnificent world. The poem begins with the speaker describing an unknown “they” who are living a life together. These characters, whose identity is never clearly revealed, seem to be obsessed with one another. They are most likely lovers and live in a state of constant admiration for “the…moon.” They live a life of love and appreciation for the celestial sights that hang over their lake. The lovers are consumed with a single thought, their “Passion” for one another. This is the emotion that drives every second of their lives and will be their downfall. All of a sudden, as if without warning, the love is over. Their hearts are broken, and they, so caught up in their relationship, die. In the final section of the piece the speaker takes a larger look at the world and shows that this loss is nothing in comparison to the enormous beauty of the “Earth.” One cannot place his or her whole life in the hands of one “Flower” when there are many “green boughs” to appreciate. The state of the planet does not hinge on the health of a single relationship. The poem also speaks on the transient nature of life. One must be willing to accept that things will not stay the same forever as well as able to appreciate something before it is gone for good. Read more poetry by Trumbell Stickney here."

And with these sky-flakes down in flurry on flurry
There is more unmixed color on the wing
Than flowers will show for days unless they hurry.

But these are flowers that fly and all but sing:
And now from having ridden out desire
They lie closed over in the wind and cling
Where wheels have freshly sliced the April mire.","It is blue-butterfly day here in spring, And with these sky-flakes","Blue- Butterfly Day' by Robert Frost describes the movements of a flock of blue butterflies and their eventual end and reincorporation into the muddy April ground. The poem begins with the speaker describing how a huge mass of butterflies is floating and “flocking” through the sky. They are like “flakes” of the sky that are headed towards the ground like snow. Their colours are not strictly blue though, they are more vibrant than the blooming flowers that have yet to reach their peak. In the second half of the poem, the speaker's tone changes and he brings the reader back into the real world where beauty, no matter how special, does not last forever. The butterflies have come to rest, folded up, in the wheel tracks left by passing cars. They are no longer above the world, but have become a part of it once more. "

The poem begins with the speaker addressing the hardships of life in Sarajevo. People have to wait in line for rations of gas and bread, never knowing if there will be enough. They take their belongings home, sometimes having to walk up eleven flights of stairs. Their lives are filled with struggle and uncertainty. They are at constant risk from falling bombs and sniper fire. Despite these terrors, love blooms at night. When there are no lights in the city, Muslims, Serbians, and Croatians can walk among one another unbothered. There is no definition to their forms, and boys and girls can “collide” and come to know one another. The symbols of light and darkness alternate in 'The Bright Lights of Sarajevo.' Sometimes the light represents hope, such as when the boy lights a match. Other times it represents danger, as seen through the clear skies. Darkness works in the same way. They are able to hide within it, but it has also consumed their world. The poem concludes with the speaker bolstering the overall mood of the text and alluding to simple, human happiness and companionship. The boy and the girl hold hands and enjoy one another's company amongst symbols of war and struggle. Read the full poem here."

The poem starts with Hamblin introducing his demise to the reader. He tells the reader that he was tarred and feathered for writing the following article in protest of the hanging of “anarchists.” The article is, in fact, a powerful allegory about the nature of justice and injustice in what was Masters' contemporary society. He uses personification to depict Lady Justice as a mad wielder of power, bribed by the rich and merciless to the poor and needy. In the end, a youth rips off her blindfold and reveals to the multitudes that what they thought was a fair and impartial justice system was in fact corrupt and oozing,"

The poem begins with the speaker describing how everything he experienced with his lover was enhanced. If it was music, a meal, or simply being in their presence, the world was more meaningful. The music was “more than music” and the bread “more than bread.” The next two lines reveal the lover is gone. Something undefined has happened to make “dead” everything that was once “so beautiful.” In the next section, he explains how everything his “beloved” touched was changed. The table, chairs, cups, plates, it has all been permanently marked. Even though this person is gone the speaker still senses them among his things. Although the memories the objects hold are happy, they also bring up an inescapable sadness. There is no way for the speaker to remove himself from the markers left behind by his lover. His world is permanently changed by this person's presence and now absence. The poem concludes with his true dedication being put on display. He explains how his heart moved with his 'beloved” wherever this person went. The speaker trailed along behind, eager to spend as much time in their presence as possible."

It is at once a poem about 'forever', 'never', 'nothing', and 'ever'. O'Rourke spins an elaborate linguistic game in order to take the attention away from her mourning process, with only slight moments of clarity shining through. It relies on the similar sounds of these words, the repetition of letters and parts of words arising throughout the poem and giving it a sing-song chime. The poet never really decides what never means, the circle continuing and O'Rourke not coming to terms with the death. By not defining ideas like 'forever', O'Rourke subconsciously avoids admitting to herself that she won't see her loved one again."

The poem presents readers with a series of images that are related to the fall season and what one might expect to see under the “harvest moon.” Through Longfellow's use of language, it's clear that the season is powerful and meaningful to his speaker. He celebrates the light of the moon and all that it reveals. The poem also suggests, towards the end of its fourteen lines, that the mind gives meaning to the various “external” symbols that nature presents."

In the first section of this piece, the speaker begins by restating the title of the poem. She will do this once more in the second stanza. Teasdale does not want the reader, or the intended listener, to forget this is the underlying problem. She goes on to state that no matter what love she gets from the listener, it is not enough to improve her depression. The speaker often wishes that she was not living. She continues on to describes her situation as similar to being stranded on the tallest peak of the grey world. There she does not have access to the earth or heaven. Everything is dark, cold, and without color. The poem concludes with the speaker saying she sees death as being the only way she is ever going to find peace. Even this is not possible for her though. Her “spirit” is too proud to allow her to die."

The “it” referenced in the poem will mean something different to each reader, and that is likely what Bukowski intended. With the broad title, ‘Love & Fame & Death,’ he provides the reader with some hint about what “it” might be, but still, it is very much up to one’s own personal reading of the poem. In the first lines, the speaker describes looking out his window and watching “it” watch him. This “it” is not defined, but it is likely one of the three forces, or all three, cited in the title. After a period of time, he scares “it” off and sends it screaming away, with the swat of a newspaper. The last lines explain to the reader the correct way to “end a poem like this”."

The poem begins by focusing on the doctor's words, 'end' signaling the approaching death. Alexander watches this scene horrified, then withdraws into herself. She discusses the ineffective nature of language, unable to accurately describe her emotions in that moment. The following day, everything goes back to normal, Alexander asked to go on with her life. Normality demonstrates that death is not the end of the world, it will continue after Alexander is gone, something she struggles to conceptualize."

No trace of age, no fear to die."," 'Teach me your mood, O patient stars!'</s","‘Teach me your mood, O patient stars!’ by Ralph Waldo Emerson is a thoughtful poem that connects a speaker’s interest in living a good life to his study of the stars.

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker addresses the stars, asking that they share their “mood” with him. He’d like to live as they do. They track through the night sky patiently and without making a fuss about life and death. They’re fearless and strong, unconcerned about when their lives are going to end. This is something the speaker envies. He, too, would like to live this kind of life."

Entire of itself.
Each is a piece of the continent,
A part of the main.
If a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less.
As well as if a promontory were.
As well as if a manor of thine own

It tolls for thee.","No man is an island, Entire of itself. Each is a piece of the continent","'For Whom the Bell Tolls/No Man is an Island' by John Donne is a short, simple poem that addresses the nature of death and the connection between all human beings. Donne begins by addressing the impossibility of solitude. “No man,” he says, is an island. All people are connected to one another. So much so that any loss is important. He extends the metaphor to compare the loss of a human being to the loss of a segment of a continent. This emphasis on interconnectivity is continued in the next lines. The poem turns, the poet addresses himself, and he asks that when the bell tolls one should not worry who it is tolling for. It is tolling for everyone. A single person's death is like the death of everyone."
1798,1809,1809,"It is portentous, and a thing of state
That here at midnight, in our little town
A mourning figure walks, and will not rest,
Near the old court-house pacing up and down.
Or by his homestead, or in shadowed yards
He lingers where his children used to play,
Or through the market, on the well-worn stones
He stalks until the dawn-stars burn away.

A famous high top-hat and plain worn shawl
Make him the quaint great figure that men love,

He cannot sleep upon his hillside now.
He is among us:—as in times before!
And we who toss and lie awake for long
Breathe deep, and start, to see him pass the door.
His head is bowed. He thinks on men and kings.
Yea, when the sick world cries, how can he sleep?
Too many peasants fight, they know not why,
Too many homesteads in black terror weep.
The sins of all the war-lords burn his heart.
He sees the dreadnaughts scouring every main.
He carries on his shawl-wrapped shoulders now
The bitterness, the folly and the pain.
He cannot rest until a spirit-dawn
Shall come;—the shining hope of Europe free;
The league of sober folk, the Workers' Earth,
Bringing long peace to Cornland, Alp and Sea.
It breaks his heart that kings must murder still,
That all his hours of travail here for men
Seem yet in vain. And who will bring white peace
That he may sleep upon his hill again?","A bronzed, lank man!

He is in his usual black suit, top-hat, and a plain shawl. Being puzzled by the contemporary devastation caused by WWI, Lincoln broods upon mankind with his head bowed down with the weight of pensive thoughts. He can't rest until there is a new dawn of hope and the statesmen fuelling the war come out of their maddening intoxication."
1799,1810,1810,"The only legend I have ever loved is
the story of a daughter lost in hell.
And found and rescued there.
Love and blackmail are the gist of it.
Ceres and Persephone the names.
And the best thing about the legend is
I can enter it anywhere. And have.
As a child in exile in
a city of fogs and strange consonants,
I read it first and at first I was
an exiled child in the crackling dusk of
the underworld, the stars blighted. Later
I walked out in a summer twilight
searching for my daughter at bed-time.
When she came running I was ready
to make any bargain to keep her.
I carried her back past whitebeams
and wasps and honey-scented buddleias.
But I was Ceres then and I knew
winter was in store for every leaf
on every tree on that road.
Was inescapable for each one we passed. And for me.
It is winter
and the stars are hidden.
I climb the stairs and stand where I can see
my child asleep beside her teen magazines,
her can of Coke, her plate of uncut fruit.
The pomegranate! How did I forget it?
She could have come home and been safe
and ended the story and all
our heart-broken searching but she reached
out a hand and plucked a pomegranate.
She put out her hand and pulled down
the French sound for apple and
the noise of stone and the proof
that even in the place of death,
at the heart of legend, in the midst
of rocks full of unshed tears
ready to be diamonds by the time
the story was told, a child can be
hungry. I could warn her. There is still a chance.
The rain is cold. The road is flint-coloured.
The suburb has cars and cable television.
The veiled stars are above ground.
It is another world. But what else
can a mother give her daughter but such
beautiful rifts in time?
If I defer the grief I will diminish the gift.
The legend will be hers as well as mine.
She will enter it. As I have.
She will wake up. She will hold
the papery flushed skin in her hand.
And to her lips. I will say nothing.",The only legend I have ever loved is the story of a daughter lost in hell. An,"'The Pomegranate' by Eavan Boland uses the story of Persephone to describe a speaker's relationship to her daughter and her daughter's future. The poem takes the reader through distorted scenes from the myth. These collide and transform the speaker's own life. The imagined and the real worlds come together as the speaker tries to sort out what it means to grow up with the legend and then raise her daughter. She contends with the passage of time and the choices her daughter is going to have to make. By the end of the poem, she comes to accept the fact that she needs to share the legend with her daughter. Together they can know it, understand, and relate to it, without having to speak about it."
1800,1811,1811,"The stick-together families are happier by far
Than the brothers and the sisters who take separate highways are.
The gladdest people living are the wholesome folks who make
A circle at the fireside that no power but death can break.
And the finest of conventions ever held beneath the sun
Are the little family gatherings when the busy day is done.
There are rich folk, there are poor folk, who imagine they are wise,
And they're very quick to shatter all the little family ties.
Each goes searching after pleasure in his own selected way,
Each with strangers likes to wander, and with strangers likes to play.
But it's bitterness they harvest, and it's empty joy they find,
For the children that are wisest are the stick-together kind.
There are some who seem to fancy that for gladness they must roam,
That for smiles that are the brightest they must wander far from home.
That the strange friend is the true friend, and they travel far astray
they waste their lives in striving for a joy that's far away,
But the gladdest sort of people, when the busy day is done,
Are the brothers and the sisters who together share their fun.
It's the stick-together family that wins the joys of earth,
That hears the sweetest music and that finds the finest mirth;
It's the old home roof that shelters all the charm that life can give;
There you find the gladdest play-ground, there the happiest spot to live.
And, O weary, wandering brother, if contentment you would win,
Come you back unto the fireside and be comrade with your kin.",The stick-together families are happier by far Than the brothers and the sisters who take separate highway,"The Stick-Together Families' by Edgar Guest describes the main reason that some families, rich or poor, are happier than others. The poem begins by stating that the most “gladsome” families are those that stick together. They do not let circumstances separate them for any reason. If a family stays true to this way of being then they will, rich or poor, be joyful. In the rest of the stanzas, the speaker outlines how much better off “stick-together” families are than those who do not try to remain by one another's side. Separate brothers and sisters will only find barren fields and joyless homes without one another. The poem concludes with the speaker appealing to a “brother” to stop wandering and return home. It is only among his family members that he will find true happiness."

Cut to us, an overhead shot, early morning,
Lying in bed, foetus curled,
back to naked back.

Opposing bass clefs,
the elegant scars on the hips of a cello,
a butterfly's white wings, resting.

The double heart of a secret fruit,
an 'X' in the equation.
An open book
with blank pages
and nothing on them but sleep,
the reading of our dreams and this.

a canvas on which you paint,

drawing upon a palette of touches,
light across the skin,

shading between my shoulder blades
with the brushstrokes of your hair,

adding depth, with the impression of your breasts
against the sentence of my spine

and texture with your tongue
cracking close in my ear,

making me realise once more that bodies, like souls
only exist when touched.

Of my story",I'm half-caste ah i'm half-caste,"'Half-caste' is a derogatory term for a person who is of mixed race. The speaker begins the poem by excusing himself for being half-caste, though it is evident fairly early on that this apology is chock-full of sarcasm. The majority of the poem is filled with the speaker responding to being called half-caste. He provides countless examples of the positive sides to being half-caste, asking himself if it being “half-caste” is like Picasso mixing his colors or the dreary English weather that is filled with cloudy skies. The speaker tells the reader that he will soon tell the “other half” of his story, signifying that his mixed-race by no means defines who he is as a person—there is so much more."

Within this scene is a coyote, moving and dodging her way into Central Park, leaving a trail for her lover. Yet, there is so much pollution around that every scent she leaves is bathed in 'oil', 'potion' and 'traps', humanity prosecuting nature and causing them to become hunted. The coyote runs into Central Park, considering the history of the location and emphasizing how humanity has forgotten the age-old importance of nature. The beauty of nature has been destroyed by progress, 'eighteen-wheelers' plowing through where once 'nomads' walked their 'trails'. Humanity has lost touch with nature, and therefore has lost touch with their own history. Nature is the only thing that is still in touch with the past, 'she hasn't forgotten' and will never do so."

Naturally, for sustaining this product, the poet has to invest in it. So, it wasn't an economical choice while he was buying it. Moreover, the poet says, the product is tough to get rid of, and the container in which it thrives is also very costly to maintain. At some point, the poet thought to keep it aside.

In the first part of this poem, the poet describes yachts sailing on a semi-protected piece of water. Although the ocean is “ungoverned,” these yachts are somewhat safe. They are sailed by “antlike” men and are described with beautiful, lyrical language. Readers should mark the turn partway through the poem that brings to light Williams' main interest. He reveals that the waters in which the yachts are sailing are filled with bodies. These bodies are desperately grasping at the sides of the yachts, hoping for salvation in a turbulent and unfair capitalist system. The yachts come to symbolize the winners or the rich, and the bodies in the water symbolize the poor who have been discarded."

However, it soon becomes clear that issues surrounding racial identity are at play. The three lies in the poem are set against this racial backdrop, showing the reader that the lies aren't so innocent after all."

The association of the “church bell” in the poem, injects the emotion of love into it. It connects two souls by ringing at a specific time of a day. When the bell rings from the nearby steeples, the lovers meet at Bredon Hill without going to church to pray. They spend a happy time together lying under the blue sky.

Elizabeth Barrett Browning continues by using the sculpture as a lens to examine the beliefs and prejudices of those that admire it, calling their own sense of morality into question.

Together, with their partner, they combine their mutual experiences and embark on their “dangerous days” together. She goes on, presumably directly addressing a bride who is about to be married. She tells this person that they don't need to worry, as all their friends will soon surround them with love. Any petty grievances of the past will be thrown out and only joy will be allowed to permeate the day.

It turns out that the reason she wasn't there was because he is “shut” up under the grass. She is dead, and far from the joys of her friends. As the poem progresses the speaker continues to mourn her loss and the attitude she brought to her life every day. By the end, he realizes that everything around him, all the stuff from the party, is worthless now that she's gone.

They must understand this fact and not fall into despair. The war can be, and will be won.

The poem, which is addressed to the Christian God, begins with the speaker asking that he be transformed into the machinery needed to create a divine fabric of God's will. This process will allow more followers to come to God's side and the speaker wants to be an integral part of that. Once the cloth is complete, the speaker will cover himself in it so that his entire being is at God's command and he is prepared for glory."
1813,1824,1824,"My mother could not bear being blind,
to be honest. One shouldn’t say it.

One should hide the fact that catastrophic
handicaps are hell; one tends to hear,

publicly from those who bear it
like a Roman, or somehow find joy

in the fight. She turned to me, once,
in a Paris restaurant, still not finding

the food on the plate with her fork,
or not so that it stayed on (try it

in a pitch-black room) and whispered,
“It’s living hell, to be honest Adam.

If I gave up hope of a cure, I’d bump
myself off.” I don’t recall what I replied,

but it must have been the usual sop,
inadequate: the locked-in son.

She kept her dignity, though, even when
bumping into walls like a dodgem; her sense
of direction did not improve, when cast
inward. “No built-in compass,” as my father

joked. Instead, she pretended to
ignore the void, or laughed it off.

Or saw things she couldn’t see
and smiled, as when the kids would offer

the latest drawing, or show her their new toy
– so we’d forget, at times, that the long,

slow slide had finished in a vision
as blank as stone. For instance, she’d continued

to drive the old Lanchester
long after it was safe

down the Berkshire lanes. She’d visit exhibitions,
admire films, sink into television

while looking the wrong way.
Her last week alive (a fortnight back)

was golden weather, of course,
the autumn trees around the hospital
ablaze with colour, the ground royal
with leaf-fall. I told her this, forgetting,

as she sat too weak to move, staring
at nothing. “Oh yes, I know,” she said,

“it’s lovely out there.” Dying has made her
no more sightless, but now she can’t

pretend. Her eyelids were closed
in the coffin; it was up to us to believe

she was watching, somewhere, in the end.","A blind mother, a blind man, a blind woman, a blind man,","On Her Blindness 'On Her Blindness' by Adam Thorpe describes a mother's life, her struggle with blindness, her death, and the family's inability to understand what she went through. The poem takes the reader through several emotional passages that depict the poet's mother's frustration at her disability. He depicts scenes where she pretends to see and pretends to feel lighthearted and optimistic about her life. Humorous moments are mixed with poignantly sad ones as the poem reaches its conclusion, and the mother passes away."
1814,1825,1825,"No Madonna and Child could touch
that picture of a mother’s tenderness
for a son she soon would have to forget.
The air was heavy with odours

of diarrhoea of unwashed children
with washed-out ribs and dried-up
bottoms struggling in laboured
steps behind blown empty bellies. Most

mothers there had long ceased
to care but not this one; she held
a ghost smile between her teeth
and in her eyes the ghost of a mother’s
pride as she combed the rust-coloured
hair left on his skull and then –

singing in her eyes – began carefully
to part it… In another life this
would have been a little daily
act of no consequence before his
breakfast and school; now she

did it like putting flowers
on a tiny grave.", A mother’s love for her son was a resounding one.</s,"Refugee Mother and Child is written in a very free-form kind of style. The phrasing and grammar of each line make it feel as though this work is only a work of poetry because of the spacing — you would write, for instance, that “No Madonna and Child could touch that picture of a mother’s tenderness for a son she would soon have to forget;” It is a complete sentence. And yet, it flows extremely well as a poem. The language itself is what is poetic. Use of the Madonna and Child imagery — referencing the popular imagery of the Virgin Mary holding her Son in her arms — immediately contrasts a beautiful image with a horrible one. To say that the beautiful image cannot touch the terrible one can be telling of a number of things. Perhaps it means that religion is of no comfort, or perhaps it means that the most beautiful image in the world cannot compare to a mother’s love. The continuation of the aforementioned line fills in the setting of them poem incredibly well. While the first verse of the poem established a truly sad atmosphere in “a son she soon would have to forget,” the entirety of this verse is dedicated to filling in an atmosphere with reality. This is the world this mother lives in — “blown empty bellies” — “washed-out ribs” — “dried-up bottoms” — “struggling in laboured steps.” The imagery is powerful. Each line brings on a new horror for the reader to contemplate, a horror that, for this mother, and for each child, is the reality in its most real form. There is an interesting spacing aspect of this poem that it presented in this verse — the beginning of the next verse is placed here instead, in the form of “the air was heavy with odours.” Alone, this is barely a complete thought, though it does fill in a few imagery-based details on our setting. The narrator goes on to tell us that for most mothers, the harsh reality hardens them; the act of childbirth is followed by the certain knowledge of coming death and horror, and so they simply stop caring for the lives of their children… they simply can’t afford to. This is not true, we are told, for the mother who forms our central character. Ghostly imagery is used here — the ghost of a smile, the ghost of her pride — to show that the mother is still heavily affected by the need to not care, but still fights through for her son. The entirety of Refugee Mother and Child come together in these last two verses, and there are a great many ways to interpret it, all of them very sad in nature. This verse highlights the harsh reality of a great many things that are taken for granted very often in the world; how something as simple as combing the hair of a young son can be a daily ritual in one country, and be equally as symbolic as decorating a grave in another. The analogy is frighteningly powerful and creates an image that is simply impossible to not contemplate deeply… which is undoubtedly the intention of the wording."
1815,1826,1826,"Locked arm in arm they cross the way,
The black boy and the white,
The golden splendor of the day,
The sable pride of night.
From lowered blinds the dark folk stare,
And here the fair folk talk,
Indignant that these two should dare
In unison to walk.
Oblivious to look and word
They pass, and see no wonder
That lightning brilliant as a sword
Should blaze the path of thunder.","The black boy and the white, The golden splendor of the day, The sable","'Tableau' by Countee Cullen is an effective poem that describes the hostility that the Black and white communities presented towards an interracial couple. In the first stanza of the poem, the speaker begins by describing a Black man and a white man walking down the street, arm in arm. They are a beautiful sight. One is described as bright like the daytime sun and the others as beautifully dark as the night. The speaker ensures that readers are presented with a positive description of both. They add that the members of both communities stare and gossip about the two men, outraged that the two are spending time together and are willing to show themselves as partners on the street. The poem concludes with a description of the two men continuing to walk down the road, uninterested in what other people think. They aren't surprised by what people are saying about them, but their feelings clear a path for them through the gossip and cruelty."
1816,1827,1827,"Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,
Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,
Sylvan historian, who canst thus express
A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:
What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape
Of deities or mortals, or of both,
In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?
What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?
What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?
What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?
Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;
Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,
Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:
Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave
Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;

For ever piping songs for ever new;

For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,
For ever panting, and for ever young;

And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?
What little town by river or sea shore,

Will silent be; and not a soul to tell
Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.

Of marble men and maidens overwrought,
With forest branches and the trodden weed;

In this poem, Keats (or at least, the speaker in the poem) mulls over the strange idea of the human figures carved into the urn. They are paradoxical figures, free from the constraints and influences of time but at the same time, imprisoned in an exact moment. For all that they don't have to worry about growing old or dying, they cannot experience life as it is for the rest of humanity. 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' represents three attempts at engaging with the urn and its scenes. Across the stanzas, Keats tries to wonder about who the figures are, what they're doing, what they represent, and what the underlying meaning of their images might be. But by the end of the poem, he realizes that the entire process of questioning is fairly redundant."
1817,1828,1828,"Rintrah roars and shakes his fires in the burdened air;
Hungry clouds swag on the deep.

Once meek, and in a perilous path,
The just man kept his course along
The vale of death.
Roses are planted where thorns grow,
And on the barren heath
Sing the honey bees.

Then the perilous path was planted:
And a river and a spring
On every cliff and tomb;
And on the bleached bones
Red clay brought forth.

Now the sneaking serpent walks
In mild humility,
And the just man rages in the wilds

Rintrah roars and shakes his fires in the burdened air;
Hungry clouds swag on the deep.","Once meek, and in a perilous path, The just man kept his","‘The Marriage of Heaven and Hell’ by William Blake is a visionary poem that explores the eternal conflict between opposing forces in the world. The poem opens with Rintrah, a symbol of chaos and rebellion, unleashing his fiery energy into the oppressive atmosphere. The atmosphere itself is burdened and heavy with hungry clouds hanging low. The poem then shifts to describe a time when the righteous man was meek and followed a safe and unchallenging path through the valley of death. However, amidst this perilous journey, roses began to bloom where thorns once thrived, and even on the desolate heath, honey bees sang. This symbolizes the emergence of beauty and sweetness in unexpected places. Yet, as the perilous path took root, rivers, and springs appeared on cliffs and tombs, and from the bleached bones, red clay emerged. This transformation indicates the infusion of life and vitality into death and decay. However, this newfound vitality also attracted the attention of a villain who abandoned comfortable paths to pursue the perilous ones, deliberately driving the righteous man into desolate lands. In the present state, the serpent, traditionally associated with deceit and temptation, slithers with false humility. Meanwhile, the just man, once meek, now rages in the untamed wilderness where lions roam freely. This signifies a reversal of roles and a manifestation of untamed passion and rebellion within the righteous. The poem concludes by repeating the image of Rintrah roaring and shaking his fires in the burdened air, emphasizing the ongoing struggle between opposing forces and the tensions present in the world. ‘The Marriage of Heaven and Hell’ depicts the constant interplay between good and evil, innocence and experience, and the transformative power of embracing both aspects of existence. It urges the reader to recognize the inherent complexity of the world and to seek harmony by reconciling these opposing forces."

The poem begins with the speaker comparing his internal relationship to the revelation in When a Stranger Calls that the call was emanating from within the house. He expands on what he means, stating that he had been under the impression that he was deep within an emotional and fulfilling relationship. Now though, he knows this wasn't the case. It was all within his mind."

A lyric poem has a tone of deep feeling or emotional reflection on the author's part. The first 12 lines of this poem follow the iambic tetrameter exhibited most clearly by the first 4 lines. Iambic tetrameter is a rhythmic pattern of four poetic feet in which there is an even pattern of stressed or unstressed syllables throughout all the words in use. The remaining lines change from this metric concept to what is called a trochaic tetrameter. This poem has a total of 22 lines with 11 rhyming couplets woven in. Each pairing rhyme (like the words ill and still) is only used once. The tone of 'Alone' is somber. Phonetically, you can see this exhibited in words like alone, thunder, or demon. Words with vowels that are lower on the tonal scale such as long “a” or “o” are in the category of phonetically darkened tones. Poe showcases his craftsman ability here in that he changes rhyming patterns mid-structure and yet the reader's suspension of disbelief is never disenchanted. One is still fully captivated by the melancholy of the man's childhood reflection. The great beauty of 'Alone' – or any lyric work-is that there is more than one official interpretation of the author's full meaning. This is encased in the tone itself. The writer has left an air of ambiguity in this creative work. He wants us to feel the same distance he has to process. We are left to ponder the same intense colors of thought that he has explored in penning this for an autograph album."

In the first quatrains of 'Longing,' the speaker begins by explaining that she doesn't feel sorry for her soul (a sentiment she repeats later on in the poem). Her soul is going to live on, finding a place for itself in eternity. Rather, she adds in the second stanza. She feels bad for her body. It's going to die, waste away, and end up back in the dirt and dust in which it originated. There, it's never going to find the joy it looked for throughout life."

The poem starts with the speaker stating that the voice of these individuals is not small. It's powerful and has a broad reach. It is doing more than mourning their losses. It is looking towards the future and fighting for a better life. The second stanza speaks to Black love. It is passionate, full, and nurtures life and more love in its place. The poet concludes the poem by reminding readers that the “voice” of Black men, women, and children is not a small one."

In the lines of 'Grown-up,' the speaker describes the fact that as a child, she used to fight with all her might for the freedom to do what she wanted. She alludes to staying up later than she was allowed to as one thing she would've preferred. As a girl, she “uttered prayers” and sobbed when told to go upstairs. Now, she realizes that the freedom of adulthood was not what it appeared to be."

The speaker begins this piece by introducing a dark dream that he was subject to. This dream, and the emotions he experienced during it, are not unfamiliar to him. He is often consumed by the darkness that these thoughts bring. He is far from being a stranger to it. In contrast, he says that having a good dream would be much more shocking as it is so different from his normal life. If this was to happen, as it does in the form of daydreams, the speaker would be broken-hearted when he returned to the real world. As he continues on he describes the kind of life he is living in which he is stuck in a pessimistic, backward-looking rut. Throughout his days he walks with his eyes on the past, unseeing of all that is currently before him. The only times he is roused from this state is by a waking dream in which light guides him to some happier emotion. Finally, the speaker concludes by saying that these daydreams are all the more poignant because they are so pure and true. They are much more impactful and meaningful than the light of the morning after a night of bad dreams."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is in the last mile of his life He knows that God has declared the beginning and end of his life and he's happy to accept those limitations. He speaks on how death is going to come for him and separate his “earth-born” body from his soul. After this happens, his sins will fall back to the earth and he will be made clean. In this new version of himself, he knows he'll ask that God make him “righteous.” He will have been purged of everything bad and be on his way to Heaven."

In the first lines of 'Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister' Browning's speaker, a Spanish monk, angrily looks at Brother Lawrence. He can't shake the man from his mind and becomes obsessed with the Brother's supposed hypocrisy. The man is, in his mind, completely immoral. His hate overwhelms him. As the poem progresses and the speaker moves through the various tasks that are assigned to him, he admits that he'd be willing to sell his soul to Satan in order to get rid of Brother Lawrence. This is a striking admission and one which shows the true hypocrisy at the heart of this story. It's not Lawrence who is betraying his vows but the speaker who is allowing hate to flourish in his heart."

The subject of this poem is standing within the prison staring at the walls and sentries that surround him. His world is confined to this “barren” beach. The sun beats down on him and he has nothing to do and his hands are “vacant” and without meaning. Around the speaker are ghosts that are representative of his past life he can no longer remember as well as those that have been in the prison before him. There are two endings to this piece, the first allows the prisoner to find some meager safety within a “lair” dug by those that have come before him and died. The second ending finds the speaker passing out in the sun and being pressed and walled in by the throngs of people until he dies. They deliver him forward, presenting his lessened state to the world."

For when I shut my eyes your face shows plain;
I hear you make some cheery old remark—
I can rebuild you in my brain,
Though you’ve gone out patrolling in the dark.
You hated tours of trenches; you were proud
Of nothing more than having good years to spend;
Longed to get home and join the careless crowd
Of chaps who work in peace with Time for friend.
That’s all washed out now. You’re beyond the wire:
No earthly chance can send you crawling back;
You’ve finished with machine-gun fire—
Knocked over in a hopeless dud-attack.
Somehow I always thought you’d get done in,
Because you were so desperate keen to live:
You were all out to try and save your skin,
Well knowing how much the world had got to give.
You joked at shells and talked the usual “shop,”
Stuck to your dirty job and did it fine:
With “Jesus Christ! when will it stop?
Three years ... It’s hell unless we break their line.”
So when they told me you’d been left for dead
I wouldn’t believe them, feeling it must be true.
Next week the bloody Roll of Honour said
“Wounded and missing”—(That’s the thing to do
When lads are left in shell-holes dying slow,
With nothing but blank sky and wounds that ache,
Moaning for water till they know
It’s night, and then it’s not worth while to wake!)
Good-bye, old lad! Remember me to God,
And tell Him that our politicians swear
They won’t give in till Prussian Rule’s been trod
Under the Heel of England ... Are you there? ...
Yes ... and the war won’t end for at least two years;
But we’ve got stacks of men ... I’m blind with tears,
Staring into the dark. Cheero!
I wish they’d killed you in a decent show.","I wish you’d say, Because I’d like to know that you’re all","Siegfried Sassoon is known, perhaps, mostly for his sympathetic view – he is not a hard man, very similar to Wilfred Owen, but perhaps even gentler than he was (Sassoon was not above mocking those who he believed at fault for the war, but Owen's vitriol was directed at everything and everybody, dragging into the limelight women, priests, and other soldiers). 'To Any Dead Officer' is one of Sassoon's gentlest, most tender poems, and it talks about the titular dead officers with a sensitivity that readers of Owen would find quite at odds with Owen's way of writing – Owen, who himself was an officer, believed that the upper levels of the military did more harm than good, especially given that half of them had bought their way into a military career, and very few had received proper training. Haig's ridiculous tactics did not help the matter. Therefore, in 'To Any Dead Officer', which can be read in full here, Sassoon is attempting to give the dead officers a semblance of life; rather than focusing specifically on their death (yet another of Owen's topics was the futility and the horror of death), he focuses on their day-to-day lives in the trenches, on what he remembers of them. It is not, as Owen would have written, a grotesque, brutalized account of their death, but an almost-celebration of their life, and while Sassoon laments the early death of the soldiers, the majority of 'To Any Dead Officer' speaks about that they lived; that they were remembered; that they will never die, so long as the poem exists."
1829,1840,1840,"Here in a quiet and dusty room they lie,
Faded as crumbled stone or shifting sand,
Forlorn as ashes, shrivelled, scentless, dry —
Meadows and gardens running through my hand.
Dead that shall quicken at the call of Spring,
Sleepers to stir beneath June’s magic kiss,
Though birds pass over, unremembering,
And no bee seek here roses that were his.

In this brown husk a dale of hawthorn dreams,
A cedar in this narrow cell is thrust
That will drink deeply of a century’s streams,
These lilies shall make summer on my dust.

Here in their safe and simple house of death,
Sealed in their shells a million roses leap;
Here I can blow a garden with my breath,
And in my hand a forest lies asleep.","Here in a quiet and dusty room they lie, Faded as crumbled stone","The Seed-Shop' by Muriel Stuart describes a speaker's experiences around dusty, ash-like seeds in a shop that acts as a prison, fending off growth and life. In the first lines of the piece, the speaker begins by stating that she is in a shop and looking around at the seeds on sale. These seeds do not seem like the beginnings of life or growth. Instead, they are dry and dirty looking. It does not seem as if they could ever grow into anything as grand as a hawthorn or ash tree. In the following lines, the speaker uses her imagination to envision moments of growth for the seeds. She sees them becoming forests full of thriving trees and lilies which will live longer than she will."
1830,1841,1841,"Smooth it glides upon its travel, Here a wimple, there a gleam-- O the clean gravel! O the smooth stream! Sailing blossoms, silver fishes, Pave pools as clear as air-- How a child wishes To live down there! We can see our colored faces Floating on the shaken pool Down in cool places, Dim and very cool; Till a wind or water wrinkle, Dipping marten, plumping trout, Spreads in a twinkle And blots all out. See the rings pursue each other; All below grows black as night, Just as if mother Had blown out the light! Patience, children, just a minute-- See the spreading circles die; The stream and all in it Will clear by-and-by.", The stream and all in it will clear by-and-by.</s,"'Looking-Glass River' by Robert Louis Stevenson is a light-hearted poem in which the speaker describes a river and children's delight over its clear surface. Throughout the six stanzas of this piece, the speaker, a child, describes how he and other children enjoy looking into the waters of a river and seeing their reflections. Deep below them, they can see into the depths of the water as well, something that's quite entertaining. This is fun for a time, but then the wind comes along and disturbs the clarity of the water. In the final stanza, the speaker takes on a more dominant tone, telling everyone not to worry and that the water will clear again."
1831,1842,1842,"If a human body has two-hundred-and-six bones
and thirty trillion cells, and each cell
has one hundred trillion atoms, if the spine
has thirty-three vertebrae—
if each atom
has a shadow—then the lilacs across the yard
are nebulae beginning to star.
If the fruit flies that settle on the orange
on the table rise
like the photons
from a bomb fire miles away,
my thoughts at the moment of explosion
are nails suspended
in a jar of honey.
I peel the orange
for you, spread the honey on your toast.
When our skin touches
our atoms touch, their shadows
merging into a shadow galaxy.
And if echoes are shadows
of sounds, if each hexagonal cell in the body
is a dark pool of jelly,
if within each cell
drones another cell—
The moment the bomb explodes
the man’s spine bends like its shadow
across the road.
The moment he loses his hearing
I think you are calling me
from across the house
because my ears start to ring.
From the kitchen window
I see the lilacs crackling like static
as if erasing, teleporting,
thousands of bees rising from the blossoms:
tiny flames in the sun.
I lick the knife and the honey pierces my tongue:
a nail made of light.
My body is wrapped in honey. When I step outside
I become fire.",If a human body has two-hundred-and-six bones and thirty,"Combustion Analysis Johnson commences her poem with a brief anatomy lesson; mentioning the number of bones and vertebrae in our body, the number of cells, and furthermore the atoms in our cells. She starts the anatomy lesson with the word if showing us that she is drawing a conclusion from the facts that she had stated. The conclusion that she comes to is that if there are so many, hundreds of trillions of elements to our outwardly simple body then the lilacs across the yard are nebulae beginning to star. This verse is beautiful in its significance. Johnson is using imagery to try to do justice to the heavy proposition being made. The world is so much more complex than what we see on the outside. If at the molecular level there is so much going on then the pretty lilacs we see growing outside are not docile organisms waiting to be watered whilst swaying in the wind. They are in reality energy-packed living beings in the fullest sense of the word. Photosynthesizing, growing, using every last resource their bodies can muster to grow more and produce more. Nebulae require tremendous amounts of energy to cause star formation, in fact, a combustion reaction must occur in order for the star to form. This is where the title of the poem could have been derived from. Johnson is trying to drive home the point that every living thing is not docile, but rather so beautiful because of the energy and potential it withholds. The next line takes an unexpected turn and Johnson uses a simile to liken fruit flies rising off of oranges to the photons rising to create a bomb explosion 'miles away'. This line is fascinating and the first thing that it shows is that everything is interconnected. There is relatedness to the way a bomb blast explodes and the way fruit flies rise off of oranges, and that relatedness is energy. Once again bringing attention to the notion that all living things are full of energy. The voice in the poem explains that the moment of the explosion, or perhaps the moment of the explosion of energy created when fruit flies exercising a multitude of different mechanisms to lift up into the air, both of which are being drawn to be of equal importance by Johnson, the voice feels as if there are nails suspended in honey. This shows that the voice feels like something so horrific and harmful, something with the potential to do so much damage is rendered harmless and made beautiful and sweet. The explosion of energy is not something harmful because it has been controlled by natural circumstances to be sweet. An important observation is Johnson's emphasis on the presence of shadows. The shadows of atoms and echoes being shadows of sound. Johnson could be addressing the shadows of varying elements on earth to once again draw attention to how everything on earth is interconnected. All shadows big or small carry the ability to mix with one another effortlessly. Johnson's mentioning of shadows could be to remind us that all things really are one and the same. The next few lines once again focus on explaining the interconnection of everything on earth. Johnson skillfully entwines the loss of hearing that a man experiences due to a bomb blast that he feels with the voice narrating the poem hearing their spouse call them in the house. With this artful connection Johnson shows quite powerfully how, at the end of the day, all sound is simply just particles and atoms being shifted in the air at varying amplitudes and wavelengths. Therefore all sound is connected in one way or the other. The last few lines go back to the voice observing the lilacs and this time the voice clearly states that it feels static energy, power, rising from the lilacs. Os much energy in fact that it appears the lilacs could disappear at any given moment. The voice 'licks' the honey and steps outside feeling like fire. This honey could refer to the honey the voice had spread on the toast earlier. If this meaning is taken then Johnson could be drawing to light how something as simple as licking honey, when examined at the molecular level is so much more advanced. The glucose going into your body, ATP production, chemical and cellular reaction after reaction. Which all ends with the same conclusion; producing energy, which is why the voice may have felt like it was 'on fire' another way of saying bursting with energy. However if a more symbolic meaning is taken for the honey, the honey in which the nail was suspended earlier, the n an altogether different conclusion can be taken. 'I lick the honey' could mean that the voice dared to taste the sweet way in which energy has been controlled by nature. The voice is attempting to understand and submerging itself into the scientific world in order to understand how so much energy can be tamed by nature. In doing so the voice metaphorically steps outside and sees the light feeling as if it is on fire because it is beginning to understand the trillions of components that make human beings function on a daily basis Combustion by Sara Eliza Johnson is a poem that describes the way everything on earth is interconnected. Johnson's poem truly opens your eyes to value even the simple things, because there is so much more going on than meets the eye. Sarah Eliza Johnson has managed to craft a poem that carries both scientific fact and skillful art hand in hand. The mood of the poem is awe and amazement. This is relevant as Johnson is trying to put on paper a tremendous realization. To be able to even begin to fathom the atomic level of our daily activities can humble even the most lively of us."

“For,” said the paper, “when this war is done
The men's first instinct will be making homes.

It combines the imagery of the marching wounded with the images of Britain beyond – of the gains from the war, at the behest and the suffering of the soldiers, and questions whether or not the war, with its price of the human innocence lost, and the human suffering experience, was worth it. Owen was staunchly anti-war, and did not believe in aiding in the fledgling attempts to bolster the troops or to help recruit for the battle. He believed it was a cruelty and indecent of poets to pull in the young and the easily influenced to fight in a horrific battle that left more than thirty-eight million dead."
1833,1844,1844,"Jamie MacCrystal sang to himself
A broken song without tune, without words;
He tipped me a penny every pension day,
Fed kindly crusts to winter birds.
When he died, his cottage was robbed,
Mattress and money box torn and searched.
Only the corpse they didn't disturb.
Maggie Owens was surrounded by animals,
A mongrel bitch and shivering pups,
Even in her bedroom a she-goat cried.

Fanged chronicler of a whole countryside:

Was her lonely need to deride.
The Nialls lived along a mountain lane
Where heather bells bloomed, clumps of foxglove.
All were blind, with Blind Pension and Wireless,
Dead eyes serpent flicked as one entered
To shelter from a downpour of mountain rain.

Until the muddy sun shone out again.
Mary Moore lived in a crumbling gatehouse,
Famous as Pisa for its leaning gable,
Bag-apron and boots, she tramped the fields
Driving lean cattle from a miry stable.

Over love stories, Red Star and Red Circle,
Dreamed of gypsy love rites, by firelight sealed.
Curate and doctor trudged to attend them,
Through knee-deep snow, through summer heat,
From main road to lane to broken path,
Gulping the mountain air with painful breath.
Sometimes they were found by neighbours,
Silent keepers of a smokeless hearth,
Suddenly cast in the mould of death.
Ancient Ireland, indeed! I was reared by her bedside,
The rune and the chant, evil eye and averted head,
Fomorian fierceness of family and local feud.
Gaunt figures of fear and of friendliness,
For years they trespassed on my dreams,
Until once, in a standing circle of stones,
I felt their shadows pass
Into that dark permanence of ancient forms.","A gypsy love story, a gypsy love story, ","'Like Dolmens Round My Childhood, the Old People' by John Montague depicts the lives and deaths of older people the speaker knew well. The poem takes the reader through a series of profiles. Each depicts the nature, habits, and quirks of someone the speaker knows. These folks are all old. Some lived good and kind lives, like Jamie in the second stanza. While others, like Maggie, were cruel and disparaging throughout their days. There are others who, through parts of their personalities, represent certain segments of Ireland. The poem concludes with a stanza that expresses the fact that all these people are now dead. They, like the dolmens they're compared to in the first line of the poem, are solid, strong, and powerful in their histories. In the last lines, the speaker expresses relief in the fact that their memories have passed from his life, freeing him."

The poem begins with the mother of the speaker and the main character, leaving the house at 3 a.m. to find her son on the porch. He is terrified and believes that someone is trying to kill him. She is in her nightgown and her husband, the son's father, is asleep, completely unaware of what is going on. The son is convinced that there is someone who wants to kill him. He feels it intensely. The mother asks who it is that wants to kill him, as she is unable to see anything dangerous outside. The son reveals that it is in fact that devil, behind “the corner house” that is going to kill him. The mother does not believe him and asks him what he is “on.” It becomes clear that the brother is not in his right mind, he is an addict and his addiction is causing him to hallucinate. The devil he sees is not really there but a product, and end result, of what he has done to himself. The poem concludes with the devil drawing closer and finally revealing himself to the mother. Her son, the brother of the speaker, has become the devil. He is gone beyond the point of no return as did Lucifer when he fell from heaven. The full poem can be read here."

1836,1847,1847,"This is for the kids who die,
Black and white,
For kids will die certainly.

Kids will die in the streets of Chicago
Organizing workers
Kids will die in the orange groves of California
Telling others to get together

And a lousy peace.

Of course, the wise and the learned

The old, the rich, and those in power do everything they can to degrade and take advantage of these kids. They're hateful, cruel, and abusive. But, the speaker says, things will eventually change. These kids might not have a monument to their deaths right now, but in the future, the rest of the world will evolve.

1837,1848,1848,"It is full summer now, the heart of June;
Not yet the sunburnt reapers are astir
Upon the upland meadow where too soon
Rich autumn time, the season's usurer,
Will lend his hoarded gold to all the trees,
And see his treasure scattered by the wild and spendthrift breeze.

Too soon indeed! yet here the daffodil,
That love-child of the Spring, has lingered on
To vex the rose with jealousy, and still
The harebell spreads her azure pavilion,
And like a strayed and wandering reveller
Abandoned of its brothers, whom long since June's messenger

The missel-thrush has frighted from the glade,
One pale narcissus loiters fearfully
Close to a shadowy nook, where half afraid
Of their own loveliness some violets lie
That will not look the gold sun in the face
For fear of too much splendour, - ah! methinks it is a place

Which should be trodden by Persephone
When wearied of the flowerless fields of Dis!
Or danced on by the lads of Arcady!
The hidden secret of eternal bliss
Known to the Grecian here a man might find,
Ah! you and I may find it now if Love and Sleep be kind.

There are the flowers which mourning Herakles
Strewed on the tomb of Hylas, columbine,
Its white doves all a-flutter where the breeze
Kissed them too harshly, the small celandine,
That yellow-kirtled chorister of eve,
And lilac lady's-smock, - but let them bloom alone, and leave

Yon spired hollyhock red-crocketed
To sway its silent chimes, else must the bee,
Its little bellringer, go seek instead
Some other pleasaunce; the anemone
That weeps at daybreak, like a silly girl
Before her love, and hardly lets the butterflies unfurl

Their painted wings beside it, - bid it pine
In pale virginity; the winter snow
Will suit it better than those lips of thine
Whose fires would but scorch it, rather go
And pluck that amorous flower which blooms alone,
Fed by the pander wind with dust of kisses not its own.

The trumpet-mouths of red convolvulus
So dear to maidens, creamy meadow-sweet
Whiter than Juno's throat and odorous
As all Arabia, hyacinths the feet
Of Huntress Dian would be loth to mar
For any dappled fawn, - pluck these, and those fond flowers which are

Fairer than what Queen Venus trod upon
Beneath the pines of Ida, eucharis,
That morning star which does not dread the sun,
And budding marjoram which but to kiss
Would sweeten Cytheraea's lips and make
Adonis jealous, - these for thy head, - and for thy girdle take

Yon curving spray of purple clematis
Whose gorgeous dye outflames the Tyrian King,
And foxgloves with their nodding chalices,
But that one narciss which the startled Spring
Let from her kirtle fall when first she heard
In her own woods the wild tempestuous song of summer's bird,

Ah! leave it for a subtle memory
Of those sweet tremulous days of rain and sun,
When April laughed between her tears to see
The early primrose with shy footsteps run
From the gnarled oak-tree roots till all the wold,
Spite of its brown and trampled leaves, grew bright with shimmering gold.

Nay, pluck it too, it is not half so sweet
As thou thyself, my soul's idolatry!
And when thou art a-wearied at thy feet
Shall oxlips weave their brightest tapestry,
For thee the woodbine shall forget its pride
And veil its tangled whorls, and thou shalt walk on daisies pied.

And I will cut a reed by yonder spring
And make the wood-gods jealous, and old Pan
Wonder what young intruder dares to sing
In these still haunts, where never foot of man
Should tread at evening, lest he chance to spy
The marble limbs of Artemis and all her company.

And I will tell thee why the jacinth wears
Such dread embroidery of dolorous moan,
And why the hapless nightingale forbears
To sing her song at noon, but weeps alone
When the fleet swallow sleeps, and rich men feast,
And why the laurel trembles when she sees the lightening east.

And I will sing how sad Proserpina
Unto a grave and gloomy Lord was wed,
And lure the silver-breasted Helena
Back from the lotus meadows of the dead,
So shalt thou see that awful loveliness
For which two mighty Hosts met fearfully in war's abyss!

And then I'll pipe to thee that Grecian tale
How Cynthia loves the lad Endymion,
And hidden in a grey and misty veil
Hies to the cliffs of Latmos once the Sun
Leaps from his ocean bed in fruitless chase
Of those pale flying feet which fade away in his embrace.

And if my flute can breathe sweet melody,
We may behold Her face who long ago
Dwelt among men by the AEgean sea,
And whose sad house with pillaged portico
And friezeless wall and columns toppled down
Looms o'er the ruins of that fair and violet cinctured town.

Spirit of Beauty! tarry still awhile,
They are not dead, thine ancient votaries;
Some few there are to whom thy radiant smile
Is better than a thousand victories,
Though all the nobly slain of Waterloo
Rise up in wrath against them! tarry still, there are a few

Who for thy sake would give their manlihood
And consecrate their being; I at least
Have done so, made thy lips my daily food,
And in thy temples found a goodlier feast
Than this starved age can give me, spite of all
Its new-found creeds so sceptical and so dogmatical.

Here not Cephissos, not Ilissos flows,
The woods of white Colonos are not here,
On our bleak hills the olive never blows,
No simple priest conducts his lowing steer
Up the steep marble way, nor through the town
Do laughing maidens bear to thee the crocus-flowered gown.

Yet tarry! for the boy who loved thee best,
Whose very name should be a memory
To make thee linger, sleeps in silent rest
Beneath the Roman walls, and melody
Still mourns her sweetest lyre; none can play
The lute of Adonais: with his lips Song passed away.

Nay, when Keats died the Muses still had left
One silver voice to sing his threnody,
But ah! too soon of it we were bereft
When on that riven night and stormy sea
Panthea claimed her singer as her own,
And slew the mouth that praised her; since which time we walk alone,

Save for that fiery heart, that morning star
Of re-arisen England, whose clear eye
Saw from our tottering throne and waste of war
The grand Greek limbs of young Democracy
Rise mightily like Hesperus and bring
The great Republic! him at least thy love hath taught to sing,

And he hath been with thee at Thessaly,
And seen white Atalanta fleet of foot
In passionless and fierce virginity
Hunting the tusked boar, his honied lute
Hath pierced the cavern of the hollow hill,
And Venus laughs to know one knee will bow before her still.

And he hath kissed the lips of Proserpine,
And sung the Galilaean's requiem,
That wounded forehead dashed with blood and wine
He hath discrowned, the Ancient Gods in him
Have found their last, most ardent worshipper,
And the new Sign grows grey and dim before its conqueror.

Spirit of Beauty! tarry with us still,
It is not quenched the torch of poesy,
The star that shook above the Eastern hill
Holds unassailed its argent armoury
From all the gathering gloom and fretful fight -
O tarry with us still! for through the long and common night,

Morris, our sweet and simple Chaucer's child,
Dear heritor of Spenser's tuneful reed,
With soft and sylvan pipe has oft beguiled
The weary soul of man in troublous need,
And from the far and flowerless fields of ice
Has brought fair flowers to make an earthly paradise.

We know them all, Gudrun the strong men's bride,
Aslaug and Olafson we know them all,
How giant Grettir fought and Sigurd died,
And what enchantment held the king in thrall
When lonely Brynhild wrestled with the powers
That war against all passion, ah! how oft through summer hours,

Long listless summer hours when the noon
Being enamoured of a damask rose
Forgets to journey westward, till the moon
The pale usurper of its tribute grows
From a thin sickle to a silver shield
And chides its loitering car - how oft, in some cool grassy field

Far from the cricket-ground and noisy eight,
At Bagley, where the rustling bluebells come
Almost before the blackbird finds a mate
And overstay the swallow, and the hum
Of many murmuring bees flits through the leaves,
Have I lain poring on the dreamy tales his fancy weaves,

And through their unreal woes and mimic pain
Wept for myself, and so was purified,
And in their simple mirth grew glad again;
For as I sailed upon that pictured tide
The strength and splendour of the storm was mine
Without the storm's red ruin, for the singer is divine;

The little laugh of water falling down
Is not so musical, the clammy gold
Close hoarded in the tiny waxen town
Has less of sweetness in it, and the old
Half-withered reeds that waved in Arcady
Touched by his lips break forth again to fresher harmony.

Spirit of Beauty, tarry yet awhile!
Although the cheating merchants of the mart
With iron roads profane our lovely isle,
And break on whirling wheels the limbs of Art,
Ay! though the crowded factories beget
The blindworm Ignorance that slays the soul, O tarry yet!

For One at least there is, - He bears his name
From Dante and the seraph Gabriel, -
Whose double laurels burn with deathless flame
To light thine altar; He too loves thee well,
Who saw old Merlin lured in Vivien's snare,
And the white feet of angels coming down the golden stair,

Loves thee so well, that all the World for him
A gorgeous-coloured vestiture must wear,
And Sorrow take a purple diadem,
Or else be no more Sorrow, and Despair
Gild its own thorns, and Pain, like Adon, be
Even in anguish beautiful; - such is the empery

Which Painters hold, and such the heritage
This gentle solemn Spirit doth possess,
Being a better mirror of his age
In all his pity, love, and weariness,
Than those who can but copy common things,
And leave the Soul unpainted with its mighty questionings.

But they are few, and all romance has flown,
And men can prophesy about the sun,
And lecture on his arrows - how, alone,
Through a waste void the soulless atoms run,
How from each tree its weeping nymph has fled,
And that no more 'mid English reeds a Naiad shows her head.

Methinks these new Actaeons boast too soon
That they have spied on beauty; what if we
Have analysed the rainbow, robbed the moon
Of her most ancient, chastest mystery,
Shall I, the last Endymion, lose all hope
Because rude eyes peer at my mistress through a telescope!

What profit if this scientific age
Burst through our gates with all its retinue
Of modern miracles! Can it assuage
One lover's breaking heart? what can it do
To make one life more beautiful, one day
More godlike in its period? but now the Age of Clay

Returns in horrid cycle, and the earth
Hath borne again a noisy progeny
Of ignorant Titans, whose ungodly birth
Hurls them against the august hierarchy
Which sat upon Olympus; to the Dust
They have appealed, and to that barren arbiter they must

Repair for judgment; let them, if they can,
From Natural Warfare and insensate Chance,
Create the new Ideal rule for man!
Methinks that was not my inheritance;
For I was nurtured otherwise, my soul
Passes from higher heights of life to a more supreme goal.

Lo! while we spake the earth did turn away
Her visage from the God, and Hecate's boat
Rose silver-laden, till the jealous day
Blew all its torches out: I did not note
The waning hours, to young Endymions
Time's palsied fingers count in vain his rosary of suns!

Mark how the yellow iris wearily
Leans back its throat, as though it would be kissed
By its false chamberer, the dragon-fly,
Who, like a blue vein on a girl's white wrist,
Sleeps on that snowy primrose of the night,
Which 'gins to flush with crimson shame, and die beneath the light.

Come let us go, against the pallid shield
Of the wan sky the almond blossoms gleam,
The corncrake nested in the unmown field
Answers its mate, across the misty stream
On fitful wing the startled curlews fly,
And in his sedgy bed the lark, for joy that Day is nigh,

Scatters the pearled dew from off the grass,
In tremulous ecstasy to greet the sun,
Who soon in gilded panoply will pass
Forth from yon orange-curtained pavilion
Hung in the burning east: see, the red rim
O'ertops the expectant hills! it is the God! for love of him

Already the shrill lark is out of sight,
Flooding with waves of song this silent dell, -
Ah! there is something more in that bird's flight
Than could be tested in a crucible! -
But the air freshens, let us go, why soon
The woodmen will be here; how we have lived this night of June!","The lark of the woodmen is out of sight, and the lark of","'The Garden of Eros' by Oscar Wilde describes a metaphorical garden of England that plays host to varied flowers and the memories of some of the greatest English poets. The first section of the poem goes into great detail about the beauty of the garden of “Eros.” The speaker describes the flowers, animal life, and the way that the sun rises and sets. A change of season is fast approaching, and time seems limited. This garden has reminded the speaker of the losses of his age. He reflects on the death of John Keats, true devotion to the goddess Venus, and then on the downing of Percy Bysshe Shelley. This turn to mourning is a perfect contrast to the pristine image presented in the first stanzas. He states that Shelley, was an admirer of Greek thought and spirituality but after his death, only one true worshiper of Venus, the goddess of love and pleasure, remained. Algernon Charles Swinburne took up the mantel and crafted poetry that took him through the ages of antiquity. The final poet mentioned is Dante Gabriel Rossetti who is the last devotee to the ideals of Greece and especially the tenants of Venus. His prestige is increased though, due to the fact that he was both a painter and writer. In the final section, the speaker describes the progress being made by modern man. He does not care for the revelations of science or the way that men are breaking down the world into pieces. It is not his “inheritance.” He is living for a greater purpose. In the final stanzas, night has come to the garden while Wilde was not paying attention. All are turning into the night, and the sun is setting right above the hills. He tells his listener that it is time to leave, and they depart, remembering the time they spent there."
1838,1849,1849,"Dear native brook! wild streamlet of the West!
How many various-fated years have passed,
What happy and what mournful hours, since last
I skimmed the smooth thin stone along thy breast,
Numbering its light leaps! Yet so deep impressed
Sink the sweet scenes of childhood, that mine eyes
I never shut amid the sunny ray,
But straight with all their tints thy waters rise,
Thy crossing plank, thy marge with willows grey,
And bedded sand that, veined with various dyes,
Gleamed through thy bright transparence! On my way,
Visions of childhood! oft have ye beguiled
Lone manhood’s cares, yet waking fondest sighs:
Ah! that once more I were a careless child!",A native brook! wild streamlet of the West! How many various-fated years,"'Sonnet: To the River Otter' by Samuel Taylor Coleridge is a short, wistful poem in which the speaker expresses a longing to return to childhood. Throughout the lines of this piece, Coleridge's speaker, who is generally considered to be the poet himself, describes a river he knew in childhood. It's unclear whether or not he's there, standing beside the river, or just looking back on the memory. Either way, he depicts the river banks, the trees, and the river's shining surface. He remembers skipping stones along with its “breast” and the joy that filled his own when he walked there as a child. Despite his longing for this time, he can't recreate it, nor can he go back and live it again."

They get wrinkles where it is better
smooth, odd coughs, and smells.
It is grotesque how they go on

of having caused us. And of how.
Their lives: surely
we can do better than that.
This goes on for a long time. Everything

In the first part of the poem, the speaker suggests that when one is a child, it is impossible to comprehend what it is like to be a parent or to understand one's own parents. As the lines progress, the speaker describes the complicated relationship between a young child and then a teenager with their parents. At times, there is a great deal of love, while at other times, the child sees their parents as gross, embarrassing, or as enemies. The poem concludes with the speaker seeing their children and interpreting their own lack of understanding."

He sees what ‘the flowers convey’, and extrapolates the meaning of true friendship. The following lines of the poem then detail a slight concern that Timrod may be reading too much into the flowers, not certain of his friendship. However, by the end of the poem, Timrod has retracted his uncertainty, stating that friendship is ‘love, without love’s flame’. This poem is a tribute to friendship, more so than the gift itself."

Written after Graves' separation from his wife, at which point he was infatuated with the poet Laura Riding, the poem clearly expresses the anguish of its narrator through extended metaphors and dramatic imagery. Whilst initially resembling a lament, the poem becomes more consolatory in tone as the stanzas progress, eventually concluding that the pain of love is evidence of its strength. The poem conflates being in love with suffering throughout, thereby highlighting how the most precious things in life can also hurt us most."

1843,1854,1854,"And because love battles
not only in its burning agricultures
but also in the mouth of men and women,
I will finish off by taking the path away
to those who between my chest and your fragrance
want to interpose their obscure plant.

About me, nothing worse
they will tell you, my love,
than what I told you.

I lived in the prairies
before I got to know you
and I did not wait love but I was
laying in wait for and I jumped on the rose.

What more can they tell you?
I am neither good nor bad but a man,
and they will then associate the danger
of my life, which you know
and which with your passion you shared.

And good, this danger
is danger of love, of complete love
for all life,
for all lives,
and if this love brings us
the death and the prisons,
I am sure that your big eyes,
as when I kiss them,
will then close with pride,
into double pride, love,
with your pride and my pride.

But to my ears they will come before
to wear down the tour
of the sweet and hard love which binds us,
and they will say: “The one
you love,
is not a woman for you,
Why do you love her? I think
you could find one more beautiful,
more serious, more deep,
more other, you understand me, look how she’s light,
and what a head she has,
and look at how she dresses,
and etcetera and etcetera”.

And I in these lines say:
Like this I want you, love,
love, Like this I love you,
as you dress
and how your hair lifts up
and how your mouth smiles,
light as the water
of the spring upon the pure stones,
Like this I love you, beloved.

To bread I do not ask to teach me
but only not to lack during every day of life.
I don’t know anything about light, from where
it comes nor where it goes,
I only want the light to light up,
I do not ask to the night
explanations,
I wait for it and it envelops me,
And so you, bread and light
And shadow are.

You came to my life
with what you were bringing,
made
of light and bread and shadow I expected you,
and Like this I need you,
Like this I love you,
and to those who want to hear tomorrow
that which I will not tell them, let them read it here,
and let them back off today because it is early
for these arguments.

Tomorrow we will only give them
a leaf of the tree of our love, a leaf
which will fall on the earth
like if it had been made by our lips
like a kiss which falls
from our invincible heights
to show the fire and the tenderness
of a true love.",I will finish off by taking the path away to those who between my chest and your fragrance want,"'And Because Love Battles' by Pablo Neruda is about a lover who negates all that society tells him about his beloved and wants to be with her forever no matter whatever it takes. This long poem presents a speaker who is puzzled by the remarks of society regarding his decision. He loves a lady and has not told her about his feelings. In this critical juncture when he is already struggling with hesitation, others come up with their gall-like suggestions. They think he is making a wrong choice. Their remarks somehow create a situation of battle inside the mind of the speaker. Whatsoever, in the last few sections of the poem, he becomes courageous. After analyzing his decision for quite a long time, he understands that others are trying to put their failure in love on him. There is no need to worry. They were not successful as they had failed to be honest. In contrast, Neruda's speaker is honest and confident about his decision. Therefore, in the end, he can firmly say that with their unification he must prove the power of their mutual love."

The Tradition begins with the naming of flowers; each symbolizes a state or characterization of African Americans, people the speaker calls “brothers”. The first eight lines describe the oppression of blacks in society. Using symbolic flowers, these lines narrate how “philosophers” and other people in power manipulate blacks into believing they are inferior. Before subjecting them to all shades of suffering. Afterward, the speaker shows how these same people attempt to bury their wrongdoings with the mundane news. The last six lines tell of the efforts the black community put into ensuring their past isn't forgotten, and the actions people in power took to destroy such hard work. Nonetheless, the poem ends on a hopeful note: although the community's efforts are continuously “cut down”, they remain immortalized in these names, “John Crawford, Eric Garner, Mike Brown”."

Dove then compares this sight to the memory of a house, suggesting that because the space is small, one can remember the layout of the whole thing. This suggests that nature is too expansive, perhaps too beautiful to truly capture in memory. Dove flows through images of memory and nature, exploring the world in a dream-like, philosophical state. The final image suggests that no matter where you are in the world, 'pain knows a way into every crevice', nature not being large enough to hide you from human suffering."

But found celestial food instead:

For suddenly close at my ear,
Loud, loud and wild, with wintry glee,
The old unfailing chorister
Burst out in pride of poetry;
And through the broken roof I spied
Him by his singing glorified.

Scarcely an arm’s-length from the eye,
Myself unseen, I saw him there;
The throbbing throat that made the cry,
The breast dewed from the misty air,
The polished bill that opened wide
And showed the pointed tongue inside;

The large eye, ringed with many a ray
Of minion feathers, finely laid,
The feet that grasped the elder-spray;
How strongly used, how subtly made

Of silver, like a brindled flower.

She goes to investigate and sees the stormcock, or mistle thrush, alongside her dilapidated home. It does not notice her. She spends the next stanzas describing what the bird looks like in great detail. The speaker takes note of everything from the eyes, to the throat and tail feathers. In the last lines, she promotes a life of optimism. One should attempt to live as the mistle thrush does, singing out even in February."

Among the hoary mountains; from the shore

In cadence, and my little boat moved on
Just like a man who walks with stately step

And troubled pleasure. Not without the voice

Leaving behind her still on either side
Small circles glittering idly in the moon,
Until they melted all into one track
Of sparkling light. A rocky steep uprose
Above the cavern of the willow-tree,
And now, as suited one who proudly rowed
With his best skill, I fixed a steady view
Upon the top of that same craggy ridge,
The bound of the horizon—for behind
Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.
She was an elfin pinnace; twenty times
I dipped my oars into the silent lake,
And as I rose upon the stroke my boat
Went heaving through the water like a swan –
When from behind that rocky steep, till then
The bound of the horizon, a huge cliff,
As if voluntary power instinct,
Upreared its head. I struck, and struck again,
And, growing still in stature, the huge cliff
Rose up between me and the stars, and still,
With measured motion, like a living thing
Strode after me. With trembling hands I turned,
And through the silent water stole my way
Back to the cavern of the willow tree.
There in her mooring-place I left my bark,
And through the meadows homeward went with grave
And serious thoughts; and after I had seen
That spectacle, for many days my brain
Worked with a dim and undetermined sense
Of unknown modes of being. In my thoughts
There was a darkness – call it solitude,
Or blank desertion – no familiar shapes
Of hourly objects, images of trees,
Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields,
But huge and mighty forms that do not live

In the first part of this poem, the speaker begins by recalling how he came upon a boat tied to a tree along the water. He untied it, got in, and pushed it off into the lake. He knew that he shouldn't steal the boat, but it also brought him pleasure. Alongside the water, he noted natural wonders like mountains and the water itself. He focused on one specific mountain and rowed in its direction. It got bigger until it rose above him and blocked out the stars. Suddenly, he felt fear at the sight of it and the feeling that it was coming after him. He was occupied for days after by that mood and the thought that there was more to the world than he understood."

The poem begins with the speaker starting that if a film contains rain, then he loves it. It does not matter how the rain comes as long as it is a deluge. It needs to be the only thing in the opening shot. This way there is no dialogue or score to interrupt its steady falling. He continues on to say that it doesn't matter how bad the film gets from there on out, as long as there was rain at the beginning. In the final lines of the poem, it becomes clear that the references to film and rain also relate to life in general. The speaker is using rain as a way to remove the damage of previous experiences and return to a purer state of being. The “ink, the milk, — the blood,” it is all forgotten."

Both knights were looking for specific features in a woman. The first wanted blonde hair and a beautiful face, and the second wanted someone who is dove-like and pure. The knights do find wives, but they are the opposite of who they intended to marry. The first knight found someone with brown hair and the second, a “wanton wild” woman.

his face gleaming with satisfaction at being this very child.
In the half darkness we look at each other

In this poem, the speaker describes the moment after making love. Their kid probably sleeps in the room close to theirs. It seems their sound might have woke him up. The speaker's husband, Fergus, has already fallen asleep after having a good time. But, his child's distress call wakes him up, and he rushes to fetch him. After he takes him in, the child snuggles between his parents, and he falls asleep. With the kid sleeping beside, the speaker thinks about how the kid is drawn to the place of his creation."
1852,1863,1863,"Blessed be Thou for all the joy
My soul has felt today!
O let its memory stay with me
And never pass away!
I was alone, for those I loved
Were far away from me,
The sun shone on the withered grass,
The wind blew fresh and free.
Was it the smile of early spring
That made my bosom glow?
'Twas sweet, but neither sun nor wind
Could raise my spirit so.
Was it some feeling of delight,
All vague and undefined?
No, 'twas a rapture deep and strong,
Expanding in the mind!
Was it a sanguine view of life
And all its transient bliss–
A hope of bright prosperity?
O no, it was not this!
It was a glimpse of truth divine
Unto my spirit given
Illumined by a ray of light
That shone direct from heaven!
I felt there was a God on high
By whom all things were made.
I saw His wisdom and his power
In all his works displayed.
But most throughout the moral world
I saw his glory shine;
I saw His wisdom infinite,
His mercy all divine.
Deep secrets of his providence
In darkness long concealed
Unto the vision of my soul
Were graciously revealed.
But while I wondered and adored
His wisdom so divine,
I did not tremble at his power,
I felt that God was mine.
I knew that my Redeemer lived,
I did not fear to die;
Full sure that I should rise again
To immortality.
I longed to view that bliss divine
Which eye hath never seen,
Like Moses, I would see His face
Without the veil between.","O let its memory stay with me And never pass away! I was alone, for those I","In Memory of a Happy Day in February is a rather specific title. With it, it is impossible to miss what the poem is about — and yet, it also raises a number of questions. Or perhaps it is more accurate to say one main question: what exactly made this day in February so happy? Anne Brontë is a poet known for her sadly short and traumatic life, and so her authorship of a memory, of a happy day to recall, is a refreshing sense of calm and contentedness to stand out from the crowd."
1853,1864,1864,"When day comes, we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade?

The loss we carry. A sea we must wade.

We braved the belly of the beast.

We’ve learned that quiet isn’t always peace, and the norms and notions of what “just” is isn’t always justice.

And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it.

Somehow we do it.

Somehow we weathered and witnessed a nation that isn’t broken, but simply unfinished.

We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one.

And, yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but that doesn’t mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect.

We are striving to forge our union with purpose.

To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man.

And so we lift our gaze, not to what stands between us, but what stands before us.

We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside.

We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another.

We seek harm to none and harmony for all.

Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true.

That even as we grieved, we grew.

That even as we hurt, we hoped.

That even as we tired, we tried.

That we’ll forever be tied together, victorious.

Not because we will never again know defeat, but because we will never again sow division.

Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid.

If we’re to live up to our own time, then victory won’t lie in the blade, but in all the bridges we’ve made.

That is the promise to glade, the hill we climb, if only we dare.

It’s because being American is more than a pride we inherit.

It’s the past we step into and how we repair it.

We’ve seen a force that would shatter our nation, rather than share it.

Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy.

And this effort very nearly succeeded.

But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated.

In this truth, in this faith we trust, for while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us.

This is the era of just redemption.

We feared at its inception.

We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour.

But within it we found the power to author a new chapter, to offer hope and laughter to ourselves.

So, while once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe, now we assert, how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us?

We will not march back to what was, but move to what shall be: a country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free.

We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation, become the future.

Our blunders become their burdens.

But one thing is certain.

If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change our children’s birthright.

So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left.

Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one.

We will rise from the golden hills of the West.

We will rise from the windswept Northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution.

We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the Midwestern states.

We will rise from the sun-baked South.

We will rebuild, reconcile, and recover.

And every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country, our people diverse and beautiful, will emerge battered and beautiful.

When day comes, we step out of the shade of flame and unafraid.

The new dawn balloons as we free it.

For there is always light, if only we’re brave enough to see it.

If only we’re brave enough to be it.","We are the successors of a country that isn't broken, but simply un","'The Hill We Climb' by Amanda Gorman was written for President Joe Biden's inauguration and speaks about the future of America. From the beginning to the end of the poem, Gorman uses images of light and darkness, hope and fear, to describe the two opposing sides of America, those who want to divide and those who want to unify. Her image of the country is not one that's defeated or failed, but one that's still on its way to being what its rhetoric already suggests it is. She seeks to inspire hope in those listening that a better day is dawning and that better times are ahead. In the concluding sections, the poet asks that “we,” American citizens and anyone listening to her read, be brave enough to “see” and “be” the light/hope that's coming."

1855,1866,1866,"At the midnight in the silence of the sleep-time,

The poem begins with a direct address from a speaker to his loved ones. From the way the poem is written, it seems Browning himself is the speaker of the poem. He addresses his dear ones as well as his admirers who might feel sad and take pity on him after his death. In an optimistic manner, he reminds everyone that he is not the one who participated in the incoherent mutterings of the “slothful,” “mawkish,” and “unmanly” individuals. He rather fought every life's battle with a brave heart and headed forward without bowing his head to apprehensions. Finally, as he prepares to die, he wants his loved ones to support him in the battle that is not far."

This poem describes various aspects of indigenous Australians. After the colonizers set their foot on their land, their culture was gradually destroyed. One after another, the things once the people used to embellish as their identity, lost their significance. The instruments such as the boomerang, stone axe, fire sticks, message-stick, woomera, and waddy have become obsolete as the people revamped their lifestyle replicating the style of the colonizers. Apart from that, Noonuccal talks about the impact of capitalism, consumerism, and materialism on aboriginal Australians in this poem."
1857,1868,1868,"Grand-dad, they say you're old and frail,
Your stocked legs begin to fail:
Your knobbed stick (that was my horse)
Can scarce support your bended corse;
While back to wall you lean so sad,
I'm vexed to see you, dad.

You used to smile and stroke my head,
And tell me how good children did;
But now, I wot not how it be,
You take me seldom on your knee;
Yet ne'ertheless I am right glad
To sit beside you, dad.

How lank and thin your beard hangs down!
Scant are the white hairs on your crown;
How wan and hollow are your cheeks!
Your brow is rough with crossing breaks;
But yet, for all his strength is fled,
I love my own old dad.

And gossips come to ask for you:
And for your weal each neighbour cares,
And good men kneel, and say their pray'rs:
And ev'rybody looks so sad,
When you are ailing, dad.

You will not die, and leave us then?
Rouse up and be our dad again.
When you are quiet and laid in bed,
We'll doff our shoes and softly tread:
And when you wake we'll aye be near,
To fill old dad his cheer.

When through the house you shift your stand,
I'll lead you kindly by the hand;
When dinner's set, I'll with you bide,
And aye be serving by your side;
And when the weary fire burns blue,
I'll sit and talk with you.

I have a tale both long and good,
About a partlet and her brood;
And cunning greedy fox that stole,
By dead of midnight, through a hole,
Which slyly to the hen-roost led —
You love a story, dad?

And then I have a wond'rous tale
Of men all clad in coats of mail,
With glitt'ring swords — you nod, I think?

1858,1869,1869,"She rose among us where we lay.
She wept, we put our work away.
She chilled our laughter, stilled our play;
And spread a silence there.
And darkness shot across the sky,
And once, and twice, we heard her cry;
And saw her lift white hands on high
And toss her troubled hair.
What shape was this who came to us,
With basilisk eyes so ominous,
With mouth so sweet, so poisonous,
And tortured hands so pale?
We saw her wavering to and fro,
Through dark and wind we saw her go;
Yet what her name was did not know;
And felt our spirits fail.
We tried to turn away; but still
Above we heard her sorrow thrill;
And those that slept, they dreamed of ill
And dreadful things:
Of skies grown red with rending flames
And shuddering hills that cracked their frames;
Of twilights foul with wings;
And skeletons dancing to a tune;
And cries of children stifled soon;
And over all a blood-red moon
A dull and nightmare size.
They woke, and sought to go their ways,
Yet everywhere they met her gaze,
Her fixed and burning eyes.
Who are you now, —we cried to her—
Spirit so strange, so sinister?
We felt dead winds above us stir;
And in the darkness heard
A voice fall, singing, cloying sweet,
Heavily dropping, though that heat,
Heavy as honeyed pulses beat,
Slow word by anguished word.
And through the night strange music went
With voice and cry so darkly blent
We could not fathom what they meant;
Save only that they seemed
To thin the blood along our veins,
Foretelling vile, delirious pains,
And clouds divulging blood-red rains
Upon a hill undreamed.
And this we heard: ""Who dies for me,
He shall possess me secretly,
My terrible beauty he shall see,
And slake my body's flame.
But who denies me cursed shall be,
And slain, and buried loathsomely,
And slimed upon with shame.""
And darkness fell. And like a sea
Of stumbling deaths we followed, we
Who dared not stay behind.
There all night long beneath a cloud
We rose and fell, we struck and bowed,
We were the ploughman and the ploughed,
Our eyes were red and blind.
And some, they said, had touched her side,
Before she fled us there;
And some had taken her to bride;
And some lain down for her and died;
Who had not touched her hair,
Ran to and fro and cursed and cried
And sought her everywhere.
""Her eyes have feasted on the dead,
And small and shapely is her head,
And dark and small her mouth,"" they said,
""And beautiful to kiss;
Her mouth is sinister and red
As blood in moonlight is.""
Then poets forgot their jeweled words
And cut the sky with glittering swords;
And innocent souls turned carrion birds
To perch upon the dead.
Sweet daisy fields were drenched with death,
The air became a charnel breath,
Pale stones were splashed with red.
Green leaves were dappled bright with blood
And fruit trees murdered in the bud;
And when at length the dawn
Came green as twilight from the east,
And all that heaving horror ceased,
Silent was every bird and beast,
And that dark voice was gone.
No word was there, no song, no bell,
No furious tongue that dream to tell;
Only the dead, who rose and fell
Above the wounded men;
And whisperings and wails of pain
Blown slowly from the wounded grain,
Blown slowly from the smoking plain;
And silence fallen again.
Until at dusk, from God knows where,
Beneath dark birds that filled the air, Like one who did not hear or care,
Under a blood-red cloud,
An aged ploughman came alone And drove his share through flesh and bone,
And turned them under to mould and stone;
All night long he ploughed.","A woman whose eyes were red and blind, and her mouth so sinister and red,","“The Vampire” by Conrad Aiken describes the coming of great evil and the choices made by men in its wake. The poem begins with the speaker, and his fellow men, observing the arrival of a great being. A woman who has power over darkness. She comes, laughs at them, weeps, and “stills” them where they stand. The world is brought to a stop and the woman, a vampire, spreads darkness across the sky. The speaker is unable to fully comprehend what he is seeing as he looks at the vampire. She is strange in shape, and terrifyingly beautiful to behold. The vampire takes to the sky and casts sorrow over the world. Those who are sleeping as all this unfolds are subjected to the most terrible dreams. They foresee the end of all things, the coming of permanent darkness, skeletons dancing, and children dying. When they rise from their sleep she stays in their consciousness, haunting them throughout the day. The vampire speaks to all the men who can listen. Her voice is impossibly to understand, her words only sound. They do not need to hear them though to have their blood chilled and hearts stopped. They know she is bringing horror to the world. Finally, her words are made clear and she speaks of the wonders that await those who join her, and the unholy deaths that deniers will face. In the wake of this pronouncement, the world goes mad. Men scramble for an opportunity to be near her, and many are killed in the chaos. Some claim to have touched her hair or her face. Others describe her visage as beautiful, and red with blood. Eventually, the violence ends, the night recedes, and the aftermath is revealed. There are bodies strewn across the field and trees splattered with red blood. In the final lines a new character is introduced, a plowman, whose job it is to turn over the devastation, hide it from view, reincorporate it into the earth,"

Ramanujan is an untraditional, image-rich, love song dedicated to the poet's sleeping wife. The poem begins with the speaker describing a fight he had with his wife. It was so long that it felt like it lasted days. The argument brought to mind images from their different pasts. He looks back into his wife's past and sees her life as an adolescent in Aden, Yemen. The speaker also sees their present, in India, and all the colors and patterns of Kerala. In the second half of the poem, he wakes from a dream in which he saw his face merge with his wife's. They became the same person, an androgynous god. When he gets up, he is happy to have had this experience but sad that they are once again physically separate people.

you see the people came up with companies
to trade across all lands
but they swelled and got much bigger
than we ever could have planned
we'd always had our wants
but now it got so quick
you could have anything you dreamed of
in a day and with a click
we noticed families had stopped talking
that's not to say they never spoke
but the meaning must have melted
and the work-life balance broke
and the children's eyes grew squarer
and every toddler had a phone
they filtered out the imperfections
but amidst the noise they felt alone
and every day the skies grew thicker
until you couldn't see the stars
so we flew in planes to find them
while down below we filled our cars
we drive around all day in circles
we'd forgotten how to run
we swapped the grass for tarmac
shrunk the parks till there were none
we filled the sea with plastic
because our waste was never capped
until each day when you went fishing
you'd pull them out already wrapped 
and while we drank and smoked and gambled
our leaders taught us why
it's best to not upset the lobbies
more convenient to die
but then in 2020 a new virus came our way
the governments reacted and told us all to hide away
but while we all were hidden
amidst the fear and all the while
the people dusted off their instincts
they remembered how to smile
they started clapping to say thank you
and calling up their mums
and while the car keys gathered dust
they would look forward to their runs
and with the skies less full of voyages
the earth began to breathe
and the beaches bore new wildlife that
scuttled off into the seas
some people started dancing some were singing
some were baking
we'd grown so used to bad news
but some good news was in the making
and so when we found the cure
and were allowed to go outside
we all preferred the world we found
to the one we'd left behind
old habits became extinct
and they made way for the new
and every simple act of kindness
was now given its due
but why did it take a virus
to bring the people back together
well sometimes you've got to get sick my boy

now lie down and dream of tomorrow
and all the things that we can do
and who knows if you dream hard enough
maybe some of them will come true

The poem begins like a bedtime story. In this piece, the speaker seems to be the father or caregiver of a child who asks him to tell the story about the virus. Thereafter, the speaker goes on to tell the story. It is about the world before the outbreak of Coronavirus. The world, depicted here, presents several aspects of the modern world. Before the pandemic, everyone was busy with their tight schedule. Children fascinated with flashing screens made their lives gamified. While elders became extremely nuclear, only thinking about their work, and work only. After the outbreak, everything changed. The distance between human beings ceased and people became closer than ever. They started to do things that gave inner pleasure, not its monetary counterpart. In this way, the pandemic appeared in the modern world as a blessing in disguise. It not only helped people to reunite but also purified the ailing environment. At the end of the poem, the speaker is optimistic about the future. He tells the child to dream bigger and brighter. As tomorrow is going to be much better than it was.

And the pond lifts them in its manifold dark arms.

But death must come to them differently,
so close to the beginning.
As though they had always been
blind and weightless. Therefore
the rest is dreamed, the lamp,
the good white cloth that covered the table,
their bodies.

And yet they hear the names they used
like lures slipping over the pond:
What are you waiting for
come home, come home, lost
in the waters, blue and permanent.","The pond is a pond, and the pond is a pond.","'The Drowned Children' by Louise Glück talks about the tragic death of a few children in a pond. 'The Drowned Children' by Louise Glück starts the statement, “You see, they have no judgment.” It creates the mood of the poem. The poem is not going to lament the loss rather it would comment on the incident in a detached manner. In the first stanza of the poem, the poet says the children were ignorant of what they were doing. It led to their demise. Thereafter the poet says, death is always egalitarian in nature. That's why she accepted those children in her cold breast without thinking much about their age. In the end, the poet says, the pond is actually responsible for their death as she has urged them to jump into it."

The nature imagery is fairly straightforward. The poem's form is also simple. It consists of three rhymed quatrains. Although the lines vary in the number of feet, Mistral manages to create a musical rhythm to the poem, as befits a poem about dance. The end line of the first two stanzas in Spanish begins with a simile “como”- like a flower, like a blade of grass, and the third stanza's end line begins on a hill. Then, each end line concludes y nada más – “and nothing more.” Nothing more could mean very little, but it could also contain very, very much – life – like in a little seed."

The poem begins with a mourner asking Guy De Vere, the intended husband of the dead Lenore, why he isn't weeping. This person does not understand, asking if De Vere has seen Lenore's dead body and really understood she is not coming back. De Vere reacts violently to the assertion that he doesn't care. He calls the mourners “Wretches” who did not really care for Lenore. The mourner tries to soothe De Vere by explaining they have all sinned but that doesn't mean he should get so upset. It is time, the mourner states, for the songs to be sung and for Lenore's “dead eyes” to be recognized. The poem concludes with De Vere stating that he will not mourn for his lost bride because she has escaped from the “damnéd” earth to sit alongside God."
1865,1876,1876,"Bix to Buxtehude to Boulez.
The little white dog on the Victor label
Listens long and hard as he is able.
It’s all in a day’s work, whatever plays.
From judgment, it would seem, he has refrained. He even listens earnestly to Bloch,
Then builds a church upon our acid rock.
He’s man’s—no—he’s the Leiermann’s best friend, Or would be if hearing and listening were the same. Does he hear? I fancy he rather smells
Those lemon-gold arpeggios in Ravel’s
“Les jets d’eau du palais de ceux qui s’aiment.”
He ponders the Schumann Concerto’s tall willow hit By lightning, and stays put. When he surmises Through one of Bach’s eternal boxwood mazes The oboe pungent as a bitch in heat,
Or when the calypso decants its raw bay rum
Or the moon in Wozzeck reddens ripe for murder, He doesn’t sneeze or howl; just listens harder. Adamant needles bear down on him from
Whirling of outer space, too black, too near—
But he was taught as a puppy not to flinch, Much less to imitate his bête noire Blanche Who barked, fat foolish creature, at King Lear.
Still others fought in the road’s filth over Jezebel, Slavered on hearths of horned and pelted barons. His forebears lacked, to say the least, forbearance. Can nature change in him? Nothing’s impossible.
The last chord fades. The night is cold and fine.
His master’s voice rasps through the grooves’ bare groves. Obediently, in silence like the grave’s
He sleeps there on the still-warm gramophone
Only to dream he is at the première of a Handel Opera long thought lost—Il Cane Minore.
Its allegorical subject is his story!

Gives rise to harmonies beyond belief,
A cast of stars . . . Is there in Victor’s heart No honey for the vanquished? Art is art.

'The Victor Dog' opens by placing the Victor dog at the center of music as the unspecified speaker lists some of the musicians the dog listens to. The speaker makes it clear that the Victor dog, as if commanded by his master, listens to any and every style of music without ever feeling emotional about it. As the poem progresses, the speaker compares the Victor dog to other dogs from music and literature who are far less observant and obedient than the Victor dog. Suddenly, the record stops, and the Victor dog sleeps in place, dreaming that Handel has written an Opera about him. The speaker compares the Victor dog to canis minor, one of many stars in the sky. At the poem's end, the speaker states that art, regardless of where it comes from or how well one understands it, is art. However, to understand and appreciate it, one must either function like the Victor dog, being observant and obedient, or be like the dogs that came before the Victor dog, appealing to emotion, barking, and disobeying."

'26 January' by Sahir Ludhianvi is all about the questions that appeared in the hearts of the Indians after independence. The poet was troubled to see what was happening around the country. Poverty, disease, homelessness, and a lot more issues made people's lives miserable. Those who had fought with the leaders were either suffering or deceived. The promises were not kept. Leaders made several commitments for the country's development and improving the lives of the poor. After independence, they forgot that they had ever made a promise to the people. The people who brought them freedom was suffering from the passivity of the leaders. That's why, the poet ironically said to the leaders, “…you are no less sinner/ O leaders of the nation you are guilty too.”"

This poem is an allegory. Here, the poet captures the conversation between two characters. One is the “Poor child of vanity,” a butterfly. The other one is a “labouring bee.” At first, the butterfly tells the bee about its lustrous and colorful wings that resemble the hues of the sky. Hearing this statement, the bee teaches its counterpart a terse lesson regarding the real meaning of beauty. According to the bee, it toils hard without caring much about its outward appearance. Satisfaction is what it gets from its work. So it leaves the “vanity of dress” to the “tribes of gaudy sloth,” a metaphorical reference to the butterflies."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that death means nothing. It causes no real separation between the deceased and those who are left behind. It becomes clear that the speaker is in fact dead and that he is using this poem to tell one particular person who is missing him, that she/he should not be. The two of them are still the same to one another as they were before. Nothing has changed in their relationship or the memories they shared. The poem concludes with the speaker informing his listener that when the time comes he will be waiting to meet her/him on the other side and they will be together with Christ. Everyone will then be happier and at peace."

There fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed
Upon my soul between the kisses and the wine;
And I was desolate and sick of an old passion,
Yea, I was desolate and bowed my head:
I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.
All night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,
Night-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;
Surely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;
But I was desolate and sick of an old passion,
When I awoke and found the dawn was grey:
I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.

Flung roses, roses riotously with the throng,
Dancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind,

I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.
I cried for madder music and for stronger wine,
But when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,
Then falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;

I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.","Last night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips an","'Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae' by Ernest Dowson tells of a speaker's unending passion for a woman he can't have. The poem begins with the speaker describing a night he spent with a lover. Although this person was beautiful and filled with passion, his thoughts were with another. When their lips touched he could only think of Cynara, a woman he loved long ago. The following lines speak on how depressed the narrator became after these emotions returned to him. He was lost in his own life and everything was without light. Dowson's speaker repeats in each stanza a line directed at Cynara. He restates his loyalty to her throughout all the changing years of his life. She is the only thing that has remained the same."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that one needs to “Watch carefully” as there are many groups that seek to control “you.” These people, who are never named, will do whatever they can to get influence over the lives of others. In an effort to avoid this outcome, one should never “Sign” something or commit to a “Slogan.” This will help avoid losing control over life. Additionally, one should care for their own “responsibilities,” even if they are distressing. There are always going to be those who wish to take control and they should be passed over and ignored. No one's life is going to be perfect, and it shouldn't be. The speaker concludes by giving the imperfection of a star as an example."

She speaks of the way in which he looks “unflinchingly” at his own face, and reproduces it just as it is. He does not attempt to embellish or improve what he sees. Through this authentic way of creating art, he helps himself confront his own past and future. The speaker lavishes praise on Rembrandt's skill and technique, as well as the way in which painting allows one to confront “darknesses” and find all the elements of one's soul that must be “reckon[ed] with.”"

The poem begins with the speaker asking what role innocence and guilt have in the world. These emotions, and all the others associated with being human feel exposed and naked. The act of feeling, in the contemporary world, seems like an unsafe thing to do. The speaker pushes back against this feature of modern society by recognizing the courage and the way it is able to strengthen the person experiencing the emotion as well as those around that person. In the next lines, she expresses her support for a life lived-in full recognition of one's own mortality. She believes that this kind of life, in which nothing is hidden and all emotion is sung out, will be joyous. The poem concludes with the speaker celebrating the nature of humanity and its connection to the larger “eternity.”"

planets, that is—the tinted ones:
Venus going down, or Mars,

they flare and falter, wobble and toss;
but if it's still they steer between
the kite sticks of the Southern Cross,

receding, dwindling, solemnly
and steadily forsaking us,
or, in the downdraft from a peak,
suddenly turning dangerous.

It splattered like an egg of fire
against the cliff behind the house.
The flame ran down. We saw the pair

of owls who nest there flying up
and up, their whirling black-and-white
stained bright pink underneath, until
they shrieked up out of sight.

a glistening armadillo left the scene,
rose-flecked, head down, tail down,

The poem begins with the speaker describing the surroundings he has access to. The land is exceedingly grey and desolate. There is nothing much for him to see, expect the lack that comes to haunt him. He is not alone though, there are crows, rabbits and men who have become as withered as the land is. In the next lines, he addresses the listener and asks that this person bring water, mountains, a well and even singing birds with them to the speaker's new unhappy home. That is if they come. The speaker is dying for a lack of things to see, do, and care about. There is nothing to stimulate his mind in any way besides deeper into darkness. The poem concludes with his prediction that one day he will have to submit himself fully to the landscape, like a spider wrapped in its own web."

He explores this idea by placing his character within a house, the outside world seeming far away and foreign. Even the beauty of nature is not enough to entice the man from his house, indeed, he can see it from the window anyway. Far away from others, he does not have to put up with the loud noises that society makes, instead of enjoying the silence in his own company.

In the first lines of the poem, the speaker receives the socks and begins to describe them. They're the best he has ever seen and he is at first unwilling to even put them on. When he does, he sees his feet transforming into a variety of creatures and objects that help to depict his feelings about the experience. In the end, he decides he has to wear them to fully appreciate them and puts his shoes on."

The poem begins with the speaker telling the reader that someone has died. As they were cremated, something gold (later revealed as a wedding ring) did not melt. The following lines tell of the moment the speaker's father asked him to bring the wedding ring to the mortuary and make sure that it ended up back on her finger. He wants it to enter into the afterlife with her. The father sees this as a symbol of their eternal bond. In the second half of the poem, the speaker goes to retrieve his mother's personal items of clothing. Along with these, he is given back the gold ring. It did not melt in the furnace and has become something even more important to him. Before, it was a symbol of the connection between his father and mother, now though it is imbued with his mother's essence. As it sits in his hand, he feels her presence circling around within the band, just like the top of an egg timer swirls on its base."

The poem begins with the speaker addressing her people, crows. They represent human beings and in their actions, human society. Throughout the poem, the speaker uses the crows, and their wants and needs, to speak about the way human wants have been whittled down to the most primitive. Humanity is willing to follow anyone who speaks charismatically and promises food (meaning, prosperity) and the ability to gain more. 'Crow Song' ends on a distressing note as the speaker is also sucked into the realm she has been criticizing. She too is now in the bubble of wants, needs, and politics."

The poem starts out with the poet leaving early in the morning on one of his famous walks. His wife tries to tag along with him, and he spends a few lines trying to explain why he thinks she's done this. She knows well that he's going to come back and bring with him flowers for the both of them. The second stanza reemphasizes this and adds that he knows she'll love these flowers (or poems, depending on how one reads the text). She just needs to let him go and do what he needs to do. But he's not unsympathetic. He knows that even a short time away from someone can feel like forever."

underfoot as if about
to burst from their crusty shells;

marveled to hear so clear

from such a small machine.
What makes the engine go?
Desire, desire, desire.
The longing for the dance
stirs in the buried life.

and it's done.

the man you married? Touch me,

The poem begins with the speaker looking to the past and distinguishing it from the present. As an older man, he sees and experiences the world differently. He admires crickets in the grass, which continue to trill with only one season to live. He directs the final lines to his wife, who he hopes will remind him of the man he used to be when she touches him."

In the first part of this poem, the speaker remembers when he fell in love, how it was a “mistake,” but that it's also been long-lasting. As the poem progresses, it becomes clear that the speaker and this person he loves are no longer together. But, despite the things that have changed, he has remained the same. He still loves the person to whom he's been speaking."

It is important to mention here that in each stanza, four possible events might have happened with the girl. The last option alludes to the abduction story of Persephone. In the second stanza, the speaker talks about how the person made her go on a date with him. He offered her a ride and asked her whether she liked to have dinner or a movie with him. In the third stanza, the first three options describe how that the girl made a conscious decision out of her bodily desires. While the last option deals specifically with the story of Persephone. The last stanza contains direct references to mythology. This section implicitly throws light on how Persephone ate the seeds and could not wholly return to the mother earth."

Miniver Cheevy often thought about antiquity and it made him sad. The age was not for him as it didn't match with the classical age in any sense.

The speaker starts out this poem by describing how he went to the Detroit River with a girl he didn't know from his high school. Together they took off their clothes and jumped into the water where they were “baptized.” This suggests a major change in their lives. Perhaps they're aging out of high school/entering into the adult world. Either way, the moments in the river felt transformative to the speaker. He knew at the time that he wouldn't be back there again. He also makes sure to note throughout the poem the reality of the setting. The water and beach were dirty, and there were factories all around them. The poem ends with the speaker noting that they put their clothes back on and returned to the world they came from."

The poem begins with a shocking first line that forces the reader to continue on, if only to find out what context in which the narrator is speaking. He describes how Alaska was taken apart piece by piece and shipped south to the rest of the forty-eight states. There, the natural resources were utilized and taken advantage of. They enriched the population, allowing the richest to buy huge “Cadillacs” and “lear / jets.” These luxury items were their reward for the plundering of land and resources. The second half of the poem connects the “rape” of Alaska to the pillaging of Jamaica by the British. The British colonies in Jamaica were witness to the forced enslavement of African peoples on sugar plantations. This brought in massive amounts of wealth to country aristocrats who, like the characters of Jane Austen's, Mansfield Park, were then allowed to luxuriate in their mansions. The poem concludes with the speaker calling Jamaica and Alaska “sisters” who together were violated and then “abandoned.”"
1890,1901,1901,"You came out of the sea,
skin dappled scales of sunlight;
Riding crests, waves of fish in your fists.
Washed up, your gills snapped shut.
Water whipped the first breath of your lungs,
Your lips’ bud teased by morning mists.

You conquered the shore, its ivory coast.
Your legs still rocked with the memory of waves.
Sinews of sand ran across your back-
Rising runes of your oceanic origins.
Your heart thumped- an animal skin drum
heralding the coming of a prince.

In the jungle, amid rasping branches,
trees loosened their shadows to shroud you.
The prince beheld you then, a golden sheen.
Your eyes, two flickers; emerald blaze
You settled back on fluent haunches;
The squall of a beast. your roar, your call.

In crackling boats, seeds arrived, wind-blown,
You summoned their colours to the palm
of your hand, folded them snugly into loam,
watched saplings swaddled in green,
as they sunk roots, spawned shade,
and embraced the land that embraced them.

Centuries, by the sea’s pulmonary,
a vein throbbing humming bumboats –
your trees rise as skyscrapers.
Their ankles lost in swilling water,
as they heave themselves higher
above the mirrored surface.

Remember your self: your raw lion heart,
Each beat a stony echo that washes
through ribbed vaults of buildings.

Remember your keris, iron lightning
ripping through tentacles of waves,
double-edged, curved to a point-

flung high and caught unsheathed, scattering
five stars in the red tapestry of your sky.","You came out of the sea, skin dappled scales of sunlight; Riding","'Lion Heart' by Amanda Chong describes the nature of the country of Singapore and how it has risen up to become a true and courageous power.

It is able to make prosperous the land and gather to it many different kinds of people.

In the first lines of 'The River,' the narrator describes how it's headed hopefully and optimistically towards the ocean, certain that there in the gray waters it's going to find peace. It's leaving its sunny valley behind for good. When the river finally meets the ocean, it realizes very quickly that this “peace” is not all it was cut out to be. It's dark and dreary, and the ocean is powerfully consuming the river's freshwater. It begs to be returned to the valley, but there's no way to reverse what has already begun. The poem concludes with the narrator describing how it's now as “bitter” as the sea."

Full to the banks, close on the promised good.

Seem’d her light foot along the garden walk,

Upon a pastoral slope as fair,

And looking to the South, and fed
With honeyed rain and delicate air,
And haunted by the starry head
Of her whose gentle will has changed my fate,
And made my life a perfumed altar-frame;
And over whom thy darkness must have spread
With such delight as theirs of old, thy great
Forefathers of the thornless garden, there
Shadowing the snow-limbed Eve from whom she came.

Than nursed at ease and brought to understand

Cold fires, yet with power to burn and brand
His nothingness into man.

Who in this stormy gulf have found a pearl
The countercharm of space and hollow sky,

A purer sapphire melts into the sea.

Not die; but live a life of truest breath,
And teach true life to fight with mortal wrongs.
Oh, why should Love, like men in drinking-songs,
Spice his fair banquet with the dust of death?

Make answer, Maud my bliss,

Life of my life, wilt thou not answer this?

With dear Love’s tie, makes love himself more dear.”

Of the long waves that roll in yonder bay?
And hark the clock within, the silver knell
Of twelve sweet hours that past in bridal white,
And die to live, long as my pulses play;
But now by this my love has closed her sight
And given false death her hand, and stol’n away
To dreamful wastes where footless fancies dwell

Among the fragments of the golden day.

Beat to the noiseless music of the night!
Has our whole earth gone nearer to the glow
Of your soft splendour that you look so bright?
I have climbed nearer out of lonely Hell.

Beat with my heart more blest than heart can tell.

He believes now that his love is reciprocated and that everything is going to turn out beautifully for both of them. He speaks on his passion, her beauty, and grace, as well as the surrounding landscape. The speaker also spends time addressing his past and how he felt before this relationship took shape. In the last lines, there is a brief bit of foreshadowing that acknowledges that everything might not turn out as cheerily as he intends."

Here at the fountain’s sliding foot,
Or at some fruit tree’s mossy root,
Casting the body’s vest aside,

Then whets, and combs its silver wings;
And, till prepar’d for longer flight,
Waves in its plumes the various light.

'The Garden' by Andrew Marvell illustrates the calm and pleasant beauty of a garden. The poetic persona seems to be walking in a garden one day. As he walks, he finds heavenly beauty emanating from the trees, herbs, and flowers. In this world where all things are prone to decay, the beauty of nature remains constant. The eternal beauty of her gardens makes the poet thoughtful about the beauty of biblical paradise. It seems that the poet wants to say, “Heaven is here, in this world, not there in your imaginary heaven!” The poem progresses with its own pace like a man walking through a garden waiting and feeding himself with what he observes. The scenic magnificence of the garden is an added gift with the description that the poet illustrates."

I want to climb towards him, the one who is not in the ground. He is sat somewhere with his brother scooping jelly from the inside of a coconut. White afro comb, vaseline and blue ironed shirts, looking sharp as the grief that drapes my body. If he saw his shirts on my back and his afro comb in my hair, he would stroke his white beard and call me revivalist.

 

Away

 

It's the grief talking, asking the dead why they aren't here. That's all it wants to know. I have his shirt, I even kept the ones he never wore, the green one that shrunk and smells of mothballs in closed cupboards.

Born from a British mother and Jamaican father, Antrobus had the influences of both cultures while growing up. In this poem he explores this contrast, focusing on the push and pull between his identities during his own search for identity."
1896,1907,1907,"It started as a pilgrimage
Exalting minds and making all
The burdens light, The second stage
Explored but did not test the call.
The sun beat down to match our rage. 5
We stood it very well, I thought ,
Observed and put down copious notes
On things the peasants sold and bought
The way of serpents and of goats.
Three cities where a sage had taught 10
But when the differences arose
On how to cross a desert patch,
We lost a friend whose stylish prose
Was quite the best of all our batch.
A shadow falls on us and grows . 15
Another phase was reached when we
Were twice attacked, and lost our way.
A section claimed its liberty
To leave the group. I tried to pray .
Our leader said he smelt the sea 20
We noticed nothing as we went,
A straggling crowd of little hope,
Ignoring what the thunder meant ,
Deprived of common needs like soap.
Some were broken, some merely bent. 25

We hardly know why we were there.

In 'Enterprise' the poet, Nissim Ezekiel talks about going on a pilgrimage. He is not alone in the journey. There are other pilgrims too in that group. They have set out to reach a destination that is unknown to the readers. It is not disclosed even at the end of the poem. There is a hint in the poem that the place is somewhere near the sea. The poet divides their journey into some stages. In each stage, the path they have chosen is not that smooth. They have to face some difficulties in order to reach their goal. Some members leave the group for their difference of opinion. One such person is an intellectual and prose writer. The situation worsens when they are close to their destination. But the ending is paradoxical. Even after suffering from hardships to reach their coveted goal, they feel dejected after reaching there. At last, the poet paradoxically remarks, “Home is where we have to gather grace.”"

This piece begins directly with reference to the time. Her life's midnight makes her think about a childhood memory. She remembers how she went out at night in her sleepwalk and walked about two miles in the dark. After being exploited physically, she returned home with a scar that even time could not heal. However, as a mature woman, she thinks there are others who have faced much pain for their race. She wants to empathize with their pain as a gesture of solidarity."
1898,1909,1909,"We wear the mask that grins and lies,
It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,—
This debt we pay to human guile;
With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,
And mouth with myriad subtleties.
Why should the world be over-wise,
In counting all our tears and sighs?
Nay, let them only see us, while
We wear the mask.
We smile, but, O great Christ, our cries
To thee from tortured souls arise.
We sing, but oh the clay is vile
Beneath our feet, and long the mile;
But let the world dream otherwise,
We wear the mask!","We wear the mask that grins and lies, It hides our cheeks and shades","We Wear the Mask' by Paul Laurence Dunbar describes the way that “We” put on, and accept the presence of masks. The poem begins with the speaker stating that “We,” a reference to all of humankind, but specifically black Americans, put on masks. We wear them, and others use them to ignore the problems that exist in modern society. They have a deep impact on our understanding of ourselves and others. Hearts are changed through tearing, and mouths contain endless expressions. The poem continues on to sarcastically ask why humankind should put out the effort to see behind the masks. It is so clear that we should take the time, but the world does not seem willing to. In conclusion, the speaker describes the unsteady foundation on which “We” sing. Positivity and optimism can only last so long on a faulty foundation."

Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.
We ask ourselves,
“Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?”
Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God.
Your playing small does not serve the world.
There's nothing enlightened about shrinking

We are all meant to shine, as children do.
We were born to make manifest the glory of God

Our deepest fear is that we are,"Meaning of Our Deepest Fear 'Our Deepest Fear' by Marianne Williamson is an inspiring and popular poem that addresses universal human potential and the power of God. This poem taps into themes of spirituality, religion, self-perception, and self-confidence. The speaker addresses, “you,” the reader, telling you that it is not the darkness that humanity fears but light. Everyone who hides their light is shirking their potential the God imbued them with. It is her belief that by doing this we are only harming one another. It is up to us to change the way we see ourselves so that we might do justice to the lives God gave us and improve the lives of others."

In this poem, the speaker recounts three separate instances of oppression that he sees around him. Each instance has its own defining characteristic that reinforces this system of oppression: violent suppression, the human impact, and loss of livelihood. Despite all this, the speaker chooses to remain indifferent. He refuses to take any responsibility to stop what he can clearly see as injustice. Instead, he focuses on worldly pleasures and his own needs. # Finally, his selfishness catches up to him as the same oppressive forces that he helped to enable, arrive at his doorstep, to mistreat him in the same way. The speaker is truly shocked since he thought he was superior and that this suffering could never fall on his shoulders."

According to the speaker, if one is “Black”, especially in their case, the world sympathizes with how painful their childhood days were. Indeed, they had to live under trying circumstances. Whatever the case may be, nobody considers how happy the poet was as a child. She lived together with her sister and parents. They bathed in a barbecue tub, celebrated their birthdays, and held Christmases. A white person who would be writing her life's account can never understand how happy she really was. "
1902,1913,1913,"They did not expect this. Being neither wise nor brave And wearing only the beauty of youth's season They took the first turning quite unquestioningly And walked quickly without looking back even once. It was of course the wrong turning. First they were nagged By a small wind that tugged at their clothing like a dog; Then the rain began and there was no shelter anywhere, Only the street and the rows of houses stern as soldiers. Though the blood chilled, the endearing word burnt the tongue. There were no parks or gardens or public houses: Midnight settled and the rain paused leaving the city Enormous and still like a great sleeping seal.

Most likely a marriage that was embarked on too hastily. The poem begins with the couple as naive newlyweds, progresses through the various decisions they make, most of which seem to be the wrong ones. It concludes as the two have grown increasingly distant and now do not even make eye contact as they are absorbed in their own worlds, separate from one another. They transfer their passion for one another into other pursuits and finally realize that at the beginning of their lives together they had no idea what they were getting into, they did not expect their lives to turn out the way that they did."
1903,1914,1914,"Is this the road that climbs above and bends
Round what was one a chalk pit: now it is
By accident an amphitheatre.
Some ash trees standing ankle-deep in brier
And bramble act the parts, and neither speak
Nor stir.' 'But see: they have fallen, every one,
And briar and bramble have grown over them.'
'That is the place. As usual no one is here.
Hardly can I imagine the drop of the axe,
And the smack that is like an echo, sounding here.'
'I do not understand.' 'Why, what I mean is
That I have seen the place two or three times
At most, and that its emptiness and silence
And stillness haunt me, as if just before
It was not empty, silent, still, but full
Of life of some kind, perhaps tragical.
Has anything unusual happened here?'
'Not that I know of. It is called the Dell.
They have not dug chalk here for a century.
That was the ash trees' age. But I will ask.'
'No. Do not. I prefer to make a tale,
Or better leave it like the end of a play,
Actors and audience and lights all gone;
For so it looks now. In my memory
Again and again I see it, strangely dark,
And vacant of a life but just withdrawn.
We have not seen the woodman with the axe.
Some ghost has left it now as we two came.'
'And yet you doubted if this were the road?'
'Well, sometimes I have thought of it and failed
To place it. No. And I am not quite sure,
Even now, this is it. For another place,
Real or painted, may have combined with it.
Or I myself a long way back in time...'
'Why, as to that, I used to meet a man---
I had forgotten,---searching for birds' nests
Along the road and in the chalk pit too.
The wren's hole was an eye that looked at him
For recognition. Every nest he knew.
He got a stiff neck, by looking this side or that,
Spring after spring, he told me, with his laugh,---
A sort of laugh. He was a visitor,
A man of forty,---smoked and strolled about.
At orts and crosses Pleasure and Pain had played
On his brown features;---I think both had lost;---
Mild and yet wild too. You may know the kind.
And once or twice a woman shared his walks,
A girl of twenty with a brown boy's face,
And hair brown as a thrush or as a nut,
Thick eyebrows, glinting eyes---' 'You have said enough.
A pair,---free thought, free love,---I know the breed:
I shall not mix my fancies up with them.'
'You please yourself. I should prefer the truth
Or nothing. Here, in fact, is nothing at all
Except a silent place that once rang loud,
And trees and us---imperfect friends, we men
And trees since time began; and nevertheless
Between us still we breed a mystery.'",The road that climbs above and bends Round what was one a chalk pit: now,"The Chalk Pit' by Edward Thomas is a lyrical depiction of an abandoned chalk-pit and the “fullness” or life one speaker senses there. The poem takes the reader through a variety of vibrant images that paint a picture of the abandoned chalk-pit. It appears to the first speaker like an amphitheatreor stage. There is something very much alive about it even though, as the second speaker says, it has been abandoned for a century. The first can't get the feeling out of his mind though. He insists that he's sensing the presence of something that “just” ended, like a play or performance. The two try to fill in details, imagined and real, about the land but in the end, the second speaker declares the place to be silent. The only thing living there are themselves and the trees and between them, they've been able to create mystery."
1904,1915,1915,"Sometimes from sorrow, for no reason,
you sing. For no reason, you accept
the way of being lost, cutting loose
from all else and electing a world
where you go where you want to.

Arbitrary, a sound comes, a reminder
that a steady center is holding
all else. If you listen, that sound
will tell you where it is and you
can slide your way past trouble.

Certain twisted monsters
always bar the path -- but that's when
you get going best, glad to be lost,
learning how real it is
here on earth, again and again.","Sometimes from sorrow, for no reason, you sing. For no reason, you accept the way","Cutting Loose' by William Stafford begins by focusing on 'sorrow'. Sometimes you feel down, which something that is completely okay. Use that sad energy to 'sing', let the words flow from within and 'go where you want to go'. The poet then moves on to focus on how 'sound comes', how guidance can come out of seemingly nowhere. You must 'listen', be ready to accept advice, and willing to change your circumstances. The final stanza admits that there are 'twisted monsters' along the way, but nothing that you will not be able to overcome. On 'earth, again and again,' life is proved to be a magical experience. Stafford explores the positive side of life, hoping that the reader will join him in his devotion to liberation and joy."

In the poem, To the Moon, by P.B. Shelley, the poet says that the moon is pale. Why? Perhaps the moon is pale because of fatigue. She has to climb up the sky every night and she has to remain awake all night and to gaze all the time at the earth. All this exertion is too much for her. Again, the moon has to travel all along among the stars with which she has nothing in common. The origin and nature of the stars are quite different from those of the moon and, therefore, the moon feels lonely and solitary among them. The moon is constantly changing in shape and size. The moon is never the same even on two consecutive nights. This change is due to the fact that the moon cannot find anyone who she can love faithfully. Just as a man's eyes may be restless because he cannot find a beloved she cannot find anybody worthy of her devotion and love. The change of the moon is thus due to her restlessness."
1906,1917,1917,"In summer when the Christmas beetles
filled each day with thin brass shrilling,
heat would wake you, lapping at the sheet,
and drive you up and out into the glare
to find the mulberry’s sweet shade
or watch ants marching underneath the guava tree.
And in the house Mommy would start
the daily ritual, whipping curtains closed,
then shutters latched against the sun
and when you crept in, thirsty, from the garden,
the house would be a cool, dark cave,
an enclave barricaded against light
and carpeted with shadow, still
except the kitchen where the door was open
to nasturtiums flaming at the steps
while on the stove the pressure cooker chugged
in tandem with the steamy day.
And in the evenings when the sun had settled
and crickets started silvering the night,
just home from school, smelling of chalk and sweat,
Daddy would do his part of it, the checking,
on the front verandah, of the scientific facts.
Then if the temperature had dropped enough
the stays were loosened and the house undressed
for night. Even the front door wide now
for the slightest breeze, a welcoming
of all the season’s scents, the jasmine,
someone else’s supper, and a neighbour’s voice –
out walking labradors, the only time of day
for it, this time of year. How well the world
was ordered then. These chill machines
don’t do it half as true, the loving regulation
of the burning days. Somehow my judgment isn’t quite
as sure when faced with weather-signs. Let me come home
to where you watch the skies and keep things right.",The shivering heat of summer is a shivering shiver.,"'Weather Eye' by Isobel Dixon is a poem filled with nostalgia for the past and a time during which family routines were strong. In the first lines of 'Weather Eye,' the speaker begins by describing how summer mornings in their youth drove them outside to the shade of a guava tree. There, they could get away from the oppressive indoor heat for a time. Their mother would close the blinds and ensure that the home cooled down and became cave-like. As the lines progress, it becomes clear that although this time in their life was difficult, they miss it. They express a desire to return to it in the final lines."

or bleated when brought down
was silent when skinned

was pulled taut over wood

and the thump thump

said give us some more, said look
at the wild flowers our war plants
in a grove and grows
just for us.

with rope and shotgun

like there’s nothing outside
but rust-colored clay and fields

of wild flowers growing
farther than we can walk.

left us dumber than remote drones. Make
me a loyal soldier and I’ll make you a
lamenting so thick, metallic, so tank-tread-hard.

cannot say I won’t forget to return in fall and

On currents of air, seeds were carried
as the processional carried us

through the streets of a forgetting city,
between the cold iron of gates.

into account, and shouldn’t we always
take the flowers into account? Bring them to us.

scraped into canvas, as a violin bow, a shovel,

an easel, a brushstroke that covers
burial mounds in grass. And love, you say,

and uproots, and tomorrow
will be a tornado, you say. Then war,
a sick wind, will come to part the air,

and place fresh flowers
on all our muddy graves.",The war said let there be war and there was war. The war said let there be peace,"Jamaal May's 'A Brief History of Hostility' describes how the war had impacted the helpless people and the hostility towards blacks. The poem begins with a portrayal of a war-ridden landscape. It has impacted the environment in such a manner that everything has changed. There is nothing in which the speaker can find the sign of life. Wild beasts, flowers, and smoke have engaged nature bitterly. In between such an ambiance, the narrator somehow feels hopeless. He is one of the slaves chained there. The pain they are going through can be seen in the lines that start with the word “fire”. Their pessimism gets reflected in the last few lines. The message is that nothing is going to change. What will remain constant, is the suffering of humans, specifically blacks."

The poem begins with the speaker introducing the landscape he is walking into. His steps are talking him farther away from civilization and deeper into ever-growing darkness. Once he is truly distant from the boardwalk and hotels he is able to let his emotions loose and allow the sea to change him. He feels a great love for everything around him. It is undefined, spreading outwards and growing like the widening sky."

According to the speaker, she is “a riddle in nine syllables”. It provides the first clue to the readers regarding the main idea of the poem. In the following lines, she describes how she feels being pregnant. She uses the metaphors of an elephant, ponderous house, melon, loaf of bread, fat purse, and cow. The description of the images as well as her thoughts revolving around pregnancy make it clear that she is tensed up about her future."

With conquering limbs astride from land to land;

A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name

Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she
With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,

In the poem, Lazarus depicts the Statue of Liberty as a woman who is welcoming all of those who need a home, and she names her the Mother of Exiles. She holds her torch in order to light the way of all of those who are seeking shelter in a new land. Lady Liberty will not turn anyone away: she will accept the tired and poor and anyone else who needs to be free."

His emotional instability about his love and her interference inspired him to write this poem. 'Sonnet 227' is an expression of the poet's unrequited love for his chaste love Laura. Petrarch tries to seek comfort and company through nature. He starts the poem by speaking to the breeze blowing around his lover, for he believes that it is closer to his love than he is. It makes him sad. Besides, he begins to express the painful part of being in unrequited love. One moment she seems to be closer to him and reachable, but at the next moment, she seems so far. He is both comforted and in pain whenever he sees his love. Towards the concluding part, he starts to wish he had the life of a stream that would only keep flowing straight and not get deflected by any distractions. Read the Italian version and the translated version of 'Sonnet 227' here."
1915,1926,1926,"Constancy is an evolution of one’s living quarters into
a thought: a continuation of a parallelogram or a rectangle

with a lampshade, an armoire in the “Slavic
Glory” fashion, four studded chairs, a sofa,
a bed, a bedside table with
little medicine bottles left there standing like
a kremlin or, better yet, manhattan.

to change hemispheres, to let new ovals

spineless, soggy, pearl-shrouding contents.",Constancy is an evolution of one’s living quarters into a thought:,"Constancy' by Joseph Brodsky describes what it means to change over time, especially when moving from one's own home to another wholly unknown environment. The poem begins with the speaker describing the way one's thoughts can change but still remain in their constant “rectangle” or “parallelogram” form. Additions are added, such as an oval, that helps to transform who a person is. The speaker sees this as a type of evolution. One's brain takes in as much information about the new location as possible until the past becomes a memory. It is no longer one's “reality” but something that exists wrapped up like a pearl in a mussel."

Throughout this poem the speaker addresses his various natural elements around her, telling them to mourn along with her and create the appropriate rhythm for her tears. She can see in the flowers, springs, and various other natural elements the markers of her own mourning. She knows that the grief she's experiencing is going to run on for a long time. It will progress “drop” by “drop”."

The poem starts with observations like “those who always know better — fifty-two” and moves to more complex categories such as “cruel when forced by circumstances — better not to know even ballpark figures.” There is a hint of irony in the use of cold statistics to describe something as intricate as human nature. Some categories have precise counts, while others are deliberately vague."
1918,1929,1929,"Lyric night of the lingering Indian Summer,
Shadowy fields that are scentless but full of singing,
Never a bird, but the passionless chant of insects,
Ceaseless, insistent.

The grasshopper’s horn, and far-off, high in the maples,
The wheel of a locust leisurely grinding the silence
Under a moon waning and worn, broken,
Tired with summer.

Weeds in the moonlight, fields that are tangled with asters,
Let me remember, soon will the winter be on us,
Snow-hushed and heavy.

While I gaze, O fields that rest after harvest,
As those who part look long in the eyes they lean to,
Lest they forget them.","The lingering Indian Summer, Shadowy fields that are scentless but full of singing,","'September Midnight' by Sara Teasdale tells of a speaker's affection for the last days of summer and all the sights and sounds that go with it. The poem begins with the speaker stating that she is observing the late night of an “Indian Summer.” The heat of the season has lasted longer than is normal, but she knows that it will soon come to an end. The first two stanzas are filled with her description of the sights and sounds around her. She can hear singing, not from birds, but from insects. She mentions the far off grasshopper and locust that is “insistent” in their “chant[ing]” and “grinding.” In the second half of the poem, she begins to admit to herself that there are not many more nights left before winter comes and silences the world. With this in mind, she asks that she be allowed to remember every element of midnight in September and be blessed by the night itself. She will stare out at the darkness as if she is attempting to memorize the face of someone she loves before they depart and are forgotten."

In the first lines of 'Preference', the speaker begins by attempting to clearly define her boundaries with the male listener. She speaks directly to him but the reader only receives one side of the conversation. The speaker tells the listener that he is distasteful to her. She knows he's deceitful and untrustworthy. All it took was a single look at his face. Since, she's been cold and detached, unwilling to even pretend they're friends. As the poem goes on, the speaker gets more and more irritated as the listener suggests that she actually loves him. He goes on to imply that she's unable to love at all. In the concluding lines of 'Preference', the speaker points out the listener's rival. He's a man out in a glade, studying papers thoughtful and is the exact opposite of the listener. He's honest, trustworthy, and steadfast. The speaker expresses her intent to remain with this person as long as God's the ruler of Heaven and earth."

The poem begins with the speaker expressing her admiration for a rose growing out of a stone. It has a strength that she can only wonder at. It manages to persevere through the harshest of environments. The speaker is living in a similarly harsh environment that she can't change. It's incredibly hot, likely a symbol of repression, and she asks the wind to help her cut a path through the heat. This path will provide some relief."

It is a poem of loss, and how that loss impacts the poet."

In this future world, the speaker implies, there are no plants, dogs, pets, ice, coffee to waste, nor any extra resources. Rather than didactically stating these facts, the speaker takes the time to craft a multilayered denial of how “we” were in the past. But, through these denials, the truth about the “past” is only more obvious. Humankind did sit by and let the world fall apart. “We” did waste resources and value air conditioning more than air."

The sonnet begins by making a general statement of what ""we"" (the world, or people in general) want to see beautiful people do: reproduce. The speaker mentions propagation (""increase"") in the first line as a way to preserve ""beauty's rose,"" the rose being the quintessential symbol of youthful beauty. We want the most beautiful creatures to reproduce to perpetuate their beauty. Thus, as beautiful creatures age and die, their beauty may continue through their heirs. But the speaker notes that the subject, in refusing to have children, is limiting his beauty, burning up his substance like a candle's flame, leaving a lack of future beauty, and thereby acting as his own enemy. The speaker says that the subject, who is one of the most beautiful objects in the world and a rival to the beauty of spring, buries his potential beauty within himself, and because he is being so miserly with his beauty, he is creating great waste. The speaker then urges the subject to show some pity for the world. If he refuses to have children, he will simply consume, like a glutton, the beauty the world deserves."

This system is not giving him what he needs, it does not provide him with the answer he called for. Nevertheless, to his frustration, he knows he will have to pay for this time he was on the phone.

The two stanzas of the poem are quite similar in form. Yeats repeats parts of the same lines twice in order to maintain the song-like qualities of the first three lines that he could remember. The speaker's relationship failed because, despite his love's urgings, he did not take life or love easy. Perhaps he rushed into things too quickly or made decisions that she didn't approve of. Either way, it ended in tears."
1928,1939,1939,"There was a roaring in the wind all night;
The rain came heavily and fell in floods;
But now the sun is rising calm and bright;
The birds are singing in the distant woods;
Over his own sweet voice the Stock-dove broods;
The Jay makes answer as the Magpie chatters;
And all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters.

All things that love the sun are out of doors;
The sky rejoices in the morning's birth;
The grass is bright with rain-drops;—on the moors
The hare is running races in her mirth;
And with her feet she from the plashy earth
Raises a mist, that, glittering in the sun,
Runs with her all the way, wherever she doth run.

I was a Traveller then upon the moor;
I saw the hare that raced about with joy;
I heard the woods and distant waters roar;
Or heard them not, as happy as a boy:
The pleasant season did my heart employ:
My old remembrances went from me wholly;
And all the ways of men, so vain and melancholy.

But, as it sometimes chanceth, from the might
Of joys in minds that can no further go,
As high as we have mounted in delight
In our dejection do we sink as low;
To me that morning did it happen so;
And fears and fancies thick upon me came;
Dim sadness—and blind thoughts, I knew not, nor could name.

I heard the sky-lark warbling in the sky;
And I bethought me of the playful hare:
Even such a happy Child of earth am I;
Even as these blissful creatures do I fare;
Far from the world I walk, and from all care;
But there may come another day to me—
Solitude, pain of heart, distress, and poverty.

My whole life I have lived in pleasant thought,
As if life's business were a summer mood;
As if all needful things would come unsought
To genial faith, still rich in genial good;
But how can He expect that others should
Build for him, sow for him, and at his call
Love him, who for himself will take no heed at all?

I thought of Chatterton, the marvellous Boy,
The sleepless Soul that perished in his pride;
Of Him who walked in glory and in joy
Following his plough, along the mountain-side:
By our own spirits are we deified:
We Poets in our youth begin in gladness;
But thereof come in the end despondency and madness.

Now, whether it were by peculiar grace,
A leading from above, a something given,
Yet it befell that, in this lonely place,
When I with these untoward thoughts had striven,
Beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven
I saw a Man before me unawares:
The oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs.

As a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie
Couched on the bald top of an eminence;
Wonder to all who do the same espy,
By what means it could thither come, and whence;
So that it seems a thing endued with sense:
Like a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf
Of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself;

Such seemed this Man, not all alive nor dead,
Nor all asleep—in his extreme old age:
His body was bent double, feet and head
Coming together in life's pilgrimage;
As if some dire constraint of pain, or rage
Of sickness felt by him in times long past,
A more than human weight upon his frame had cast.

Himself he propped, limbs, body, and pale face,
Upon a long grey staff of shaven wood:
And, still as I drew near with gentle pace,
Upon the margin of that moorish flood
Motionless as a cloud the old Man stood,
That heareth not the loud winds when they call,
And moveth all together, if it move at all.

At length, himself unsettling, he the pond
Stirred with his staff, and fixedly did look
Upon the muddy water, which he conned,
As if he had been reading in a book:
And now a stranger's privilege I took;
And, drawing to his side, to him did say,
""This morning gives us promise of a glorious day.""

A gentle answer did the old Man make,
In courteous speech which forth he slowly drew:
And him with further words I thus bespake,
""What occupation do you there pursue?
This is a lonesome place for one like you.""
Ere he replied, a flash of mild surprise
Broke from the sable orbs of his yet-vivid eyes.

His words came feebly, from a feeble chest,
But each in solemn order followed each,
With something of a lofty utterance drest—
Choice word and measured phrase, above the reach
Of ordinary men; a stately speech;
Such as grave Livers do in Scotland use,
Religious men, who give to God and man their dues.

He told, that to these waters he had come
To gather leeches, being old and poor:
Employment hazardous and wearisome!
And he had many hardships to endure:
From pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor;
Housing, with God's good help, by choice or chance;
And in this way he gained an honest maintenance.

The old Man still stood talking by my side;
But now his voice to me was like a stream
Scarce heard; nor word from word could I divide;
And the whole body of the Man did seem
Like one whom I had met with in a dream;
Or like a man from some far region sent,
To give me human strength, by apt admonishment.

My former thoughts returned: the fear that kills;
And hope that is unwilling to be fed;
Cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills;
And mighty Poets in their misery dead.
—Perplexed, and longing to be comforted,
My question eagerly did I renew,
""How is it that you live, and what is it you do?""

He with a smile did then his words repeat;
And said that, gathering leeches, far and wide
He travelled; stirring thus about his feet
The waters of the pools where they abide.
""Once I could meet with them on every side;
But they have dwindled long by slow decay;
Yet still I persevere, and find them where I may.""

While he was talking thus, the lonely place,
The old Man's shape, and speech—all troubled me:
In my mind's eye I seemed to see him pace
About the weary moors continually,
Wandering about alone and silently.
While I these thoughts within myself pursued,
He, having made a pause, the same discourse renewed.

And soon with this he other matter blended,
Cheerfully uttered, with demeanour kind,
But stately in the main; and, when he ended,
I could have laughed myself to scorn to find
In that decrepit Man so firm a mind.
""God,"" said I, ""be my help and stay secure;
I'll think of the Leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!""","The old man was a lonesome man, a lonesome man","'Resolution and Independence' is a deeply moving poem of Wordsworth that teaches the value of faith, resolution, and independence through the life of an old leech gatherer the narrator meets in the poem. In 'Resolution and Independence', Wordsworth deals with a leech gatherer who he met during his walks through the countryside after a night of rain. The poem begins with the positivity of nature. But soon the poet's mood reflects upon the balance of life between happiness and sorrow. Despite the happiness around him he worries thinking about life ending in despondency and madness. Soon this thought of him takes an opposite turn when the poet meets with the old man who is weak yet works with resolution and lives an honest life. The poet resolves not to give in to misery, but to live independently with a firm mind similar to that of the leech gatherer."

There was a naughty boy,
A naughty boy was he,
He would not stop at home,
He could not quiet be-
He took
In his knapsack
A book
Full of vowels
And a shirt
With some towels,
A slight cap
For night cap,
A hair brush,
Comb ditto,
New stockings
For old ones
Would split O!
This knapsack
Tight at's back
He rivetted close
And followed his nose
To the north,

And follow'd his nose

There was a naughty boy
And a naughty boy was he,
For nothing would he do
But scribble poetry-
He took
An ink stand
In his hand
And a pen
Big as ten
In the other,
And away
In a pother
He ran
To the mountains
And fountains
And ghostes
And postes
And witches
And ditches
And wrote
In his coat
When the weather
Was cool,
Fear of gout,
And without

To follow one's nose

In washing tubs three

Get up early
And go
By hook or crook
To the brook
And bring home
Miller's thumb,
Tittlebat
Not over fat,
Minnows small
As the stall
Of a glove,
Not above
The size
Of a nice

Little fingers-

Of fish a pretty kettle

Was as merry,
That a cherry
Was as red,
That lead
Was as weighty,
That fourscore
Was as eighty,
That a door
Was as wooden

In the first stanza of 'A Song About Myself,' the speaker begins by describing a naughty young boy who decided to pack up his bag and travel to the north, to Scotland. He packed a lot into his small bag and set out exactly when and where he chose. Keats uses the humorous description of the boy following his “nose” there. In the second stanza, he spends time talking about the boy's love for poetry, another clear reference to the poet's own interests, and how he wanted to disappear into the mountains and write. There, he's seen “witches” and “ditches” and more. The following stanza is about the child's love of fishing and how he'd keep the fish in a washing tub. In the last stanza, the poet returns to the image of the child walking north to Scotland. When he got there, he realized that everything was very similar to the country he'd just left. Weights, distances, and people were exactly alike. This is something that surprised and left him somewhat in shock. The poem ends on this note, creating a nice moral for a young reader to consider."

Each stanza of this piece begins with the speaker telling his listener, presumably his lover, to stop asking a specific question. These are generally all associated with the changing of the season from summer to winter. He tells her that the beauty of the world never vanishes, even though it may disappear from its original location. The sun relocates to her eyes, the flowers to her general beauty and the nightingale to her voice. She becomes the embodiment of all things good, pure, and lovely that exist in the summer."

The poet then explores how his perspective of his partner has changed now he has left the relationship. Whereas before Gay would have done anything for them, he now realizes their true nature. The poem continues through examples of his changing attitude to his partner. The final line creates a sense of ending, the strong 'We're through' signifying the end of their relationship. Gay will not be going back anytime soon."

The Speaker breaks too from the usually elevated style of writing often associated with love poetry. Armitage employs 'plain English' and straightforward language in his poem and makes must use of internal and half-rhyme. It is these half-lines which give the poem its distinctive rhythm. Particularly when read aloud, the reader knows instinctively where to pause and place the emphasis."
1933,1944,1944,"Only the feathers floating around the hat
Showed that anything more spectacular had occurred

The confusing aspects of the case,
And the witnesses ran off to a gang war.
So the report filed and forgotten in the archives read simply
“Drowned,” but it was wrong: Icarus
Had swum away, coming at last to the city
Where he rented a house and tended the garden.

“That nice Mr. Hicks” the neighbors called,
Never dreaming that the gray, respectable suit
Concealed arms that had controlled huge wings
Nor that those sad, defeated eyes had once
Compelled the sun. And had he told them
They would have answered with a shocked,
uncomprehending stare.
No, he could not disturb their neat front yards;
Yet all his books insisted that this was a horrible mistake:
What was he doing aging in a suburb?
Can the genius of the hero fall
To the middling stature of the merely talented?



And nightly Icarus probes his wound
And daily in his workshop, curtains carefully drawn,
Constructs small wings and tries to fly
To the lighting fixture on the ceiling:
Fails every time and hates himself for trying.
He had thought himself a hero, had acted heroically,
And dreamt of his fall, the tragic fall of the hero;
But now rides commuter trains,

Serves on various committees,
And wishes he had drowned.","Icarus had swum away, coming at last to the city where he","'Icarus' by Edward Field places the mythological Icarus in a modern context. Forced to live a normal existence, the hero is out of place and alienated from society. In 'Icarus', Field uses the mythological story of Icarus and Daedalus as a frame for his poem. The Icarus in Greek mythology flies too close to the sun, causing his artificial wings to melt. He falls, plunges into the sea, and drowns. Fields takes up the story here and adapts it to a modern context. In his poem, Icarus does not drown but swims away and rents a house in the city. Normal life, however, does not suit Icarus. He is displaced and becomes alienated from society."

'Long Finish' begins with the speaker reminiscing on his marriage. It happened underneath pine boughs, an image that will come back up in the poem a number of times. They've been together for ten years, through ups and downs. He still feels a great deal of desire for his wife and makes this clear though suggestions of her shedding her clothes mention of her waist and neckline. As the poem continues on, he jumps to a short narrative describing the deaths of two different people in Northern Ireland. 'Long Finish' moves on to a shoreline which is the setting for the Noh poem, Matsukaze. There are constant references to an unending future continuation and a place between “longing and loss.” Different characters inhabit this place, and at the end of the poem the speaker describes how he and his wife pass through it on their way to forever “and then some”.

1935,1946,1946,"This is the beginning.
Almost anything can happen.
This is where you find
the creation of light, a fish wriggling onto land,
the first word of Paradise Lost on an empty page.
Think of an egg, the letter A,
a woman ironing on a bare stage
as the heavy curtain rises.
This is the very beginning.
The first-person narrator introduces himself,
tells us about his lineage.
The mezzo-soprano stands in the wings.
Here the climbers are studying a map
or pulling on their long woolen socks.
This is early on, years before the Ark, dawn.
The profile of an animal is being smeared
on the wall of a cave,
and you have not yet learned to crawl.
This is the opening, the gambit,
a pawn moving forward an inch.
This is your first night with her,
your first night without her.
This is the first part
where the wheels begin to turn,
where the elevator begins its ascent,
before the doors lurch apart.

This is the middle.
Things have had time to get complicated,
messy, really. Nothing is simple anymore.
Cities have sprouted up along the rivers
teeming with people at cross-purposes—
a million schemes, a million wild looks.
Disappointment unshoulders his knapsack
here and pitches his ragged tent.
This is the sticky part where the plot congeals,
where the action suddenly reverses
or swerves off in an outrageous direction.
Here the narrator devotes a long paragraph
to why Miriam does not want Edward's child.
Someone hides a letter under a pillow.
Here the aria rises to a pitch,
a song of betrayal, salted with revenge.
And the climbing party is stuck on a ledge
halfway up the mountain.
This is the bridge, the painful modulation.
This is the thick of things.
So much is crowded into the middle—
the guitars of Spain, piles of ripe avocados,
Russian uniforms, noisy parties,
lakeside kisses, arguments heard through a wall—
too much to name, too much to think about.

And this is the end,
the car running out of road,
the river losing its name in an ocean,
the long nose of the photographed horse
touching the white electronic line.
This is the colophon, the last elephant in the parade,
the empty wheelchair,
and pigeons floating down in the evening.
Here the stage is littered with bodies,
the narrator leads the characters to their cells,
and the climbers are in their graves.
It is me hitting the period
and you closing the book.
It is Sylvia Plath in the kitchen
and St. Clement with an anchor around his neck.
This is the final bit
thinning away to nothing.

what everything comes down to,

a hat on a peg, and outside the cabin, falling leaves.", The beginning of Paradise Lost is the beginning of the story.</s,"Aristotle' by Billy Collins is a powerful and intricate poem that depicts the beginning, middle and end of all things. He speaks on the beginnings of a written work in the first stanza, like the one the reader is engaged within that moment as well as the beginnings of life. There are images associated with creationism and evolution, as well as life dramas and disasters. The second section is about the middle of all things. It is the “thick” of the action. This section is where the climbers climb to their deaths, people fight, have revelations, and experience change. In the last lines, he alludes to the fates of Pope Clement I and Sylvia Plath. He also speaks of Aristotle. The “end” is the place we have all been waiting to end up. It is there that everything converges."

The poem begins with an initial question that is answered by the ending of the poem, “What is it to grow old?” This question is expanded on and described in the following stanzas. The first describes the loss of physical beauty and the second about the loss of physical strength and feeling in limbs. The third stanza of the poem begins to speak on the expectations one had about age during youth and how these expectations are not fulfilled. Old age is not a warm sunset, it is not to look back on one's life with fondness. In fact, trapped in one's body as a prison, one feels as if they were never young. The poem concludes by describing how by the end of life one will come to hate their own body, blaming their aging prison for their loss of spirit, strength, and emotion. "

She doesn't want them to mourn for her, cry, or get lost in their grief. She'd like them to celebrate their time together, remember her for a time, and then happily forget and move on. She notes that she's going to do the same. She had a wonderful life, but now she's on her way home, to heaven, and to the next one.

1940,1951,1951,"The animal I really dig,
Above all others is the pig.
Pigs are noble. Pigs are clever,
Pigs are courteous. However,
Now and then, to break this rule,
One meets a pig who is a fool.
What, for example, would you say,
If strolling through the woods one day,
Right there in front of you you saw
A pig who'd built his house of STRAW?
The Wolf who saw it licked his lips,
And said, ""That pig has had his chips.""
""Little pig, little pig, let me come in!""
""No, no, by the hairs on my chinny-chin-chin!""
""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!""
The little pig began to pray,
But Wolfie blew his house away.
He shouted, ""Bacon, pork and ham!
Oh, what a lucky Wolf I am!""
And though he ate the pig quite fast,
He carefully kept the tail till last.
Wolf wandered on, a trifle bloated.
Surprise, surprise, for soon he noted
Another little house for pigs,
And this one had been built of TWIGS!
""Little pig, little pig, let me come in!""
""No, no, by the hairs on my chinny-chin-chin!""
""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!""
The Wolf said, ""Okay, here we go!""
He then began to blow and blow.
The little pig began to squeal.
He cried, ""Oh Wolf, you've had one meal!
Why can't we talk and make a deal?
The Wolf replied, ""Not on your nelly!""
And soon the pig was in his belly.
""Two juicy little pigs!"" Wolf cried,
""But still I'm not quite satisfied!
I know how full my tummy's bulging,
But oh, how I adore indulging.""
So creeping quietly as a mouse,
The Wolf approached another house,
A house which also had inside
A little piggy trying to hide.
""You'll not get me!"" the Piggy cried.
""I'll blow you down!"" the Wolf replied.
""You'll need,"" Pig said, ""a lot of puff,
And I don't think you've got enough.""
Wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew.
The house stayed up as good as new.
""If I can't blow it down,"" Wolf said,
I'll have to blow it up instead.
I'll come back in the dead of night
And blow it up with dynamite!""
Pig cried, ""You brute! I might have known!""
Then, picking up the telephone,
He dialed as quickly as he could
The number of red Riding Hood.
""Hello,"" she said. ""Who's speaking? Who?
Oh, hello, Piggy, how d'you do?""
Pig cried, ""I need your help, Miss Hood!
Oh help me, please! D'you think you could?""
""I'll try of course,"" Miss Hood replied.
""What's on your mind...?"" ""A Wolf!"" Pig cried.
""I know you've dealt with wolves before,
And now I've got one at my door!""
""My darling Pig,"" she said, ""my sweet,
That's something really up my street.
I've just begun to wash my hair.
But when it's dry, I'll be right there.""
A short while later, through the wood,
Came striding brave Miss Riding Hood.
The Wolf stood there, his eyes ablaze,
And yellowish, like mayonnaise.
His teeth were sharp, his gums were raw,
And spit was dripping from his jaw.
Once more the maiden's eyelid flickers.
She draws the pistol from her knickers.
Once more she hits the vital spot,
And kills him with a single shot.
Pig, peeping through the window, stood
And yelled, ""Well done, Miss Riding Hood!""
Ah, Piglet, you must never trust
Young ladies from the upper crust.
For now, Miss Riding Hood, one notes,
Not only has two wolfskin coats,
But when she goes from place to place,
She has a PIGSKIN TRAVELING CASE.","The animal I really dig, Above all others is the pig. Pigs are noble.","'The Three Little Pigs' by Roald Dahl retells the story of Little Red Riding Hood and the Three Little Pigs with a surprisingly dark conclusion. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he really likes pigs. This likely makes the story all the difficult for him to tell as it does not end well. There are some pigs, he says, that are not as clever as others. They are lesser. The first lives in a straw house that is incapable of protecting him. The perspective switches to the wolf. He blows down the house and devours the first pig. The pig does not put up much resistance, simply praying the situation would go away. Things go a bit better for the second pig as he is able to argue briefly for his life. It doesn't help him though and soon he too is in the belly of the wolf. The wolf is well aware that he is bloated and in theory, doesn't need any more food. That doesn't stop him from going to the third house. Once he arrives at the final house he soon discovers this pig is not going to be as easily taken. The house will not blow down, no matter how hard he tries. While inside, cowering for his life, the pig calls “Miss Red.” She saves him from the wolf but in a twist ending decides to kill him and make him into a carrying case."

From the rude stream into the bay;

The poem begins with the speaker starting a long conceit, or complex metaphor comparing things usually seen as quite different from one another. In this case, it is lovers and bodies of water. The eddy, a swirling part of the stream, separates “herself” from the rest of the water. With her new freedom, she travels away from the larger system she was a part of. This symbolizes a woman's walking out on her husband/lover. She soon takes up with another man, a river. She brushes against his banks, willing him to allow her to make a deeper connection. At first, he isn't sure but after she threatens to leave, they join together. In the second part of the poem the narration changes to the first person and the speaker addresses one particular listener. He wants their relationship to be like the river and the eddies. He will keep her safe from the “rude” stream. Discover more of Thomas Carew's poems."

The poem begins with a simple, three-line description of a contusion or bruise. Plath describes a body that may or may not be deceased that is completely devoid of color except for a pale purple patch on the skin. She describes the sea sucking at a pit of rock, the fly-like nature of the contusion, and concludes with a series of images that suggest the end of one's life."
1943,1954,1954,"Swallows travel to and fro,
And the great winds come and go,
And the steady breezes blow,
Bearing perfume, bearing love.
Breezes hasten, swallows fly,
Towered clouds forever ply,
And at noonday, you and I
See the same sunshine above.
Dew and rain fall everywhere,
Harvests ripen, flowers are fair,
And the whole round earth is bare
To the moonshine and the sun;
And the live air, fanned with wings,
Bright with breeze and sunshine, brings
Into contact distant things,
And makes all the countries one.
Let us wander where we will,
Something kindred greets us still;
Something seen on vale or hill
Falls familiar on the heart;
So, at scent or sound or sight,
Severed souls by day and night
Tremble with the same delight -
Tremble, half the world apart.","The great winds come and go, And the steady breezes blow, Bearing perfume, bearing love","Stevenson crafted this poem with the idea of human interconnectedness in mind. He wanted to demonstrate through his speaker how everyone, no matter where they live can relish their relation through nature. Stevenson uses the image of the “swallows traveling to and fro” to demonstrate the freedom of the world and one's connection to everyone else. This piece begins with the swaying motion of the wind and breeze, created through his word and rhyme choice. The breeze bears love on its back and transports it wherever it travels. The first stanza concludes by saying that at noon, no matter where “you and I” are, we see the “same sunshine above.” The poem continues on, demonstrating how when summer comes, the world is awash with creatures, and burgeoning harvest, and the breeze “brings / into contact distant things.” The conclusion of the poem emphasizes our connection through our senses, and our closeness through our mutual experience of the world. This connection, Stevenson's speaker says, should make one “tremble” with “delight.”"

I cultivate myself where the,"'The Truth the Dead Know' by Anne Sexton describes the poet's own emotions in reaction to the death of her parents and the actions she chose to take afterward. The poem begins with the speaker stating that she is departing a funeral. She has no desire to participate in the tradition any longer and is ready to flee to a better part of the world. Sexton, and someone she refers to as “My darling” is going to take a trip to the Cape in Massachusetts. It is there that she will heal from her losses and they will spend their time “touching.” The poem concludes with Sexton dismissing any need to consider the dead as they are like stone. They are inanimate and impossible to “bless.”"

What begins as a tale of a “shrunk” world and a “mouse” in peril becomes the story of a woman at the “ends” of life. There are elements that go unanswered in this poem, and these concepts only add to the overall impression of life’s “winter,” or death, since it is a confusing and chaotic concept in itself. There is no clear rhyme scheme or pattern to the lines, and this reinforces the confusion and chaos of death. From start to finish—from changing perspectives to mismatched words—Hughes depicts the grief, fear, confusion, and loneliness of death in a striking way within this poem."

Merwin is about the personified “air” that talks about its surroundings and its purpose while blowing at night. This piece begins with the night scene when the natural force is dominant. The speaker of this piece is none other than air. It describes the night as an “overturned lute.” While blowing through the night, it unsettles the dust around it and the leaves that fearfully wait for the winter. The air is also aware of the rain and how it goes nowhere. But, it has a purpose. It goes through the deserts of the past and future, singing the beautiful song of nature."

In 'Letters From Yorkshire,' the speaker imagines the man's way of life in the lap of nature and appreciates it by valuing his proximity to nature. Just as the poet has presented these two characters, it seems as if they both have been very close to each other. The man might be continuously writing letters to her and talks even about the little development in his life, such as returning of the 'first lapwings,' which is an indication of spring season coming. However, from start to end, there hasn't been anything that could reveal how they both know each other and how they both relate to each other. It is only our guesses we make seeing the letters sharing between both of them that make us believe that they have some relation with each other. In conclusion, the poet wishes to have a life-like letter-writing man in the poem, and therefore she regards it as romantic and fulfilling."

All,"'Story of a Hotel Room' by Rosemary Tonks tells of a ruinous sexual encounter between the speaker and her lover in a hotel room. The poem begins with the speaker exclaiming over events of the past. It very quickly becomes clear that she is reminiscing on an experience she had with the intended listener of this piece in which they had sex in a hotel. They were not in a committed relationship, as becomes clear towards the end of the poem, but she refers to their encounter as “love making.” It had all the qualities of a passionate romance, so much so that it was “ruinous.” By the end of Story of a Hotel Room the speaker expresses some regret that she didn't know of the consequences of this rendezvous before it happened. She wishes that someone had told her, that “without permanent intentions” that there is “no protection.”"
1949,1960,1960,"The line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift, The road is forlorn all day, Where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift, And the hoof-prints vanish away. The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,
Expend their bloom in vain. Come over the hills and far with me, And be my love in the rain. The birds have less to say for themselves In the wood-world’s torn despair
Than now these numberless years the elves, Although they are no less there: All song of the woods is crushed like some Wild, easily shattered rose. Come, be my love in the wet woods; come,
Where the boughs rain when it blows. There is the gale to urge behind And bruit our singing down, And the shallow waters aflutter with wind From which to gather your gown. What matter if we go clear to the west, And come not through dry-shod? For wilding brooch shall wet your breast The rain-fresh goldenrod. Oh, never this whelming east wind swells But it seems like the sea’s return To the ancient lands where it left the shells Before the age of the fern; And it seems like the time when after doubt Our love came back amain. Oh, come forth into the storm and rout And be my love in the rain.","The line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift, The road is forlorn","'A Line-storm Song' by Robert Frost is a thoughtful poem about the difficulties inherent to love and relationships. In the first lines of the poem, the poet uses his characteristic imagery to depict a storm and its effects. He then asks the listener, someone he loves, to embrace the storm and be his “love in the rain.” The same pattern emerges throughout the next stanzas as the speaker describes elements of nature and then addresses his love. No matter what's going on in the world, there is a sense of perseverance in the lines. The speaker wants to continue seeking and bettering his love no matter the difficulties. Love is at once beautiful and destructive, the speaker suggests."

The poet takes the reader through a series of destructive images. At first, the flood is overwhelming a city on a very general level, but also, even more dramatically on a smaller one. Everything this speaker knows is being consumed but rather than climb on board the ship like the “sword bearer” and “tax collector” he decides to say. He's going to fight for his homeland and do what he can to stem the flow of water. It is a fruitless fight but one that he's willing to lose his life for."

1952,1963,1963,"All of us came in Doctor Kerlin's bag.
He'd arrive with it, disappear to the room
And by the time he'd reappear to wash

Those nosy, rosy, big, soft hands of his
In the scullery basin, its lined insides
(The colour of a spaniel's inside lug)

Were empty for all to see, the trap-sprung mouth
Unsnibbed and gaping wide. Then like a hypnotist
Unwinding us, he'd wind the instruments
Back into their lining, tie the cloth
Like an apron round itself,
Darken the door and leave

With the bag in his hand, a plump ark by the keel ...
Until the next time came and in he'd come
In his fur-lined collar that was also spaniel-coloured

And go stooping up to the room again, a whiff
Of disinfectant, a Dutch interior gleam
Of waistcoat satin and highlights on the forceps.

Getting the water ready, that was next—
Not plumping hot, and not lukewarm, but soft,
Sud-luscious, saved for him from the rain-butt

And savoured by him afterwards, all thanks
Denied as he towelled hard and fast,
Then held his arms out suddenly behind him

To be squired and silk-lined into the camel coat.
At which point he once turned his eyes upon me,
Hyperborean, beyond-the-north-wind blue,

Two peepholes to the locked room I saw into
Every time his name was mentioned, skimmed
Milk and ice, swabbed porcelain, the white
And chill of tiles, steel hooks, chrome surgery tools
And blood dreeps in the sawdust where it thickened
At the foot of each cold wall. And overhead

The little, pendent, teat-hued infant parts
Strung neatly from a line up near the ceiling—
A toe, a foot and shin, an arm, a cock

A bit like the rosebud in his buttonhole.


Poeta doctus Peter Levi says
Sanctuaries of Asclepius (called asclepions)
Were the equivalent of hospitals

In ancient Greece. Or of shrines like Lourdes,
Says poeta doctus Graves. Or of the cure
By poetry that cannot be coerced,

That the whole place was a sanatorium
With theatre and gymnasium and baths,
A site of incubation, where ""incubation""
Was technical and ritual, meaning sleep
When epiphany occurred and you met the god ...

As the thurifer I was in an open air procession
In Lourdes in '56

Again I nearly fainted as I bent

Of our scullery window, starting in to draw
With his large pink index finger dot-faced men

With button-spots in a straight line down their fronts
And women with dot breasts, giving them all

That soon began to run. And then as he dipped and laved
In the generous suds again, miraculum:
The baby bits all came together swimming

Into his soapy big hygienic hands
And I myself came to, blinded with sweat,
Blinking and shaky in the windless light.


Bits of the grass I pulled I posted off
To one going into chemotherapy
And one who had come through. I didn't want

To leave the place or link up with the others.
It was mid-day, mid-May, pre-tourist sunlight
In the precincts of the god,

The very site of the temple of Asclepius.
I wanted nothing more than to lie down
Under hogweed, under seeded grass

And to be visited in the very eye of the day
By Hygeia, his daughter, her name still clarifying
The haven of light she was, the undarkening door.


The room I came from and the rest of us all came from
Stays pure reality where I stand alone,
Standing the passage of time, and she's asleep

In sheets put on for the doctor, wedding presents
That showed up again and again, bridal
And usual and useful at births and deaths.

Me at the bedside, incubating for real,
Peering, appearing to her as she closes
And opens her eyes, then lapses back

Into a faraway smile whose precinct of vision
I would enter every time, to assist and be asked
In that hoarsened whisper of triumph,

You can read the full poem here and more Seamus Heaney poetry here. Part I In the first part of 'Out of the Bag' the speaker, who is likely Heaney at a very young age, depicts childbirth. Or, at least what he thinks childbirth is. Through a few compelling and lighthearted stanzas the young speaker describes the doctor, Doctor Kerlin, and his bag. It is from this bag that he and all his siblings emerged. There is true magic around the doctor and his bag that the young speaker is entranced by. He can't quite understand it but has come to a charming conclusion about the origins of life. No doubt helped on by his parents. There are a few moments of darkness in amongst the joyful and humorous descriptions provided by this young speaker. He sees the doctor's tools and imagines the horrors that could go on. The last line of this section sees the speaker imagine a child's tiny “cock” as the flower in the doctor's buttonhole. Parts II, III, and IV Part II of 'Out of the Bag' is quite different than part I. The same themes are addressed but from a much older, wiser, and learned speaker. He uses ancient and contemporary histories to depict what medicine is and can be and how one goes about finding healing powers. Particularly he is interested in the world of Asclepius, the Greek god of healing. The third section takes the reader into the 1950s and depicts, through vague and otherworldly language, a scene in which Heaney almost fainted and one in which he had a hallucination of the realm of Asclepius. 'Out of the Bag' concludes with the speaker as a child again at his mother's bedside talking to her after the birth of one of his siblings."

Wastes beyond wastes below;

From this moment, the readers are trapped with the speaker. The various interpretations as to what spell the speaker is under.

1954,1965,1965,"Behold the gloomy tyrant’s awful form
Binding the captive earth in icy chains;
His chilling breath sweeps o’er the watery plains,
Howls in the blast, and swells the rising storm.

Threat’ning the lowly vale with frowning pride,
O’er the scared flocks that seek its sheltering side,
A fearful ruin o’er their heads to pour.
While to the cheerful hearth and social board

The speaker begins by describing “Winter” as a “being,” or tyrant, of unlimited power. He can decimate the world with his “chilling breath” and raise a storm effortlessly. It is with this power that he freezes the world every year, casting countless people into deeper misery. In the second stanza, the poet crafts a metaphor in an attempt to show the desperation of the poor. When winter is on its way, and a storm is beginning to form, many will do anything to find some form of shelter. In this piece, the “scared flocks” try to hunker within a “lowly vale” as some form of protection. As they are doing this, they are unaware that a weak and fragile tower is on the verge of falling on top of them. No matter where they go, death is waiting for them. In the final six-line stanza, the speaker describes how those with financial means can find warmth and even cozy happiness in their homes by their fires. This is a life that many more do not have access to. For these “sons of want,” winter brings death and fear. Fate has sent them nothing but poverty, and even poverty in all her resilience is shaking with the chill of the winter months."

Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass.
And the eyes of those two Indian ponies
Darken with kindness.

To welcome my friend and me.
We step over the barbed wire into the pasture
Where they have been grazing all day, alone.
They ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness That we have come.
They bow shyly as wet swans. They love each other.
There is no loneliness like theirs. At home once more,
They begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness. I would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,
For she has walked over to me And nuzzled my left hand. She is black and white,
Her mane falls wild on her forehead,

That if I stepped out of my body I would break

The speaker takes the reader through details of a meeting between two friends and two ponies along the side of the road. There, the friends stepped into the horses' pasture and were greeted warmly. The speaker has a deeply moving experience where he's urged on by the breeze to touch the pony's ear and recall the sensation of touching a woman's wrist. This allows him to open his mind and come to the realization that he could step out o his body and “blossom”. Meaning, he could become more than he is and come to better understand the mysteries of the universe."

Nothing's changed.","A shivering boy shivers down the glass, a shiver","'Nothing's Changed' is a poem that portrays and picturizes the problems rampant in South Africa between the whites and blacks. The title of the poem depicts what the poet wants to convey through the text of the poem. He says, “Nothing has changed” ever since he left this place. Even now the discrimination is quite visible not only among the whites but even the things that belong to the whites and the blacks. The poem depicts the apartheid system in District Six near Cape Town in South Africa while exploring the broader history of racism. The ironic title brings to light how the apartheid has changed nothing but the physical appearance of District Six. 'Nothing's Changed' expresses the poet's anger toward the racists, especially the whites. It reveals the experience of turning back to South Africa after the system of racial separation, called Apartheid, had been upturned."

The poem begins with the speaker stating that her life is charged, and driven, by her love for her daughter. This love is to her as important as her own soul; her own spark of being that makes her “mortal clay” sentient. All is not well in her world, though. The speaker and her daughter have been separated for an extended period of time and it is only the thought of possibly seeing her daughter again in the future that sustains the speaker. It is this fact alone that makes her smile when she thinks of “the future day,” and allows her to get through “the present pain” of life. In the second stanza, the speaker describes what she hopes it will be like when the two of them are reunited. She wants their familiar love for one another to be rejuvenated and become just as strong as it once was. Additionally, the speaker admits to some doubt over whether she will ever see her daughter again. This doubt comes into the narrative in the last two lines of the stanza as if she is just now admitting it to herself. It passes as quickly as it came, as she finishes the poem. In the final six lines, the speaker addresses the main subject of the piece, her daughter's marriage. She truly hopes that the man her daughter married is as good as her daughter is and that he deserves her. The speaker knows that if this is the case, then her daughter has been “fairly won.” The last two lines profess, once more, the speaker's desire to see her daughter again and her enduring hope that this will happen."

1960,1971,1971,"In Worcester, Massachusetts,
I went with Aunt Consuelo
to keep her dentist's appointment
and sat and waited for her
in the dentist's waiting room.
It was winter. It got dark
early. The waiting room
was full of grown-up people,
arctics and overcoats,
lamps and magazines.
My aunt was inside
what seemed like a long time
and while I waited I read
the National Geographic
(I could read) and carefully
studied the photographs:
the inside of a volcano,
black, and full of ashes;
then it was spilling over
in rivulets of fire.

laced boots, and pith helmets.
A dead man slung on a pole

Babies with pointed heads
wound round and round with string;
black, naked women with necks
wound round and round with wire
like the necks of light bulbs.
Their breasts were horrifying.
I read it right straight through.
I was too shy to stop.
And then I looked at the cover:
the yellow margins, the date.
Suddenly, from inside,
came an oh! of pain
--Aunt Consuelo's voice--
not very loud or long.
I wasn't at all surprised;
even then I knew she was
a foolish, timid woman.
I might have been embarrassed,
but wasn't. What took me
completely by surprise
was that it was me:
my voice, in my mouth.
Without thinking at all
I was my foolish aunt,
I--we--were falling, falling,
our eyes glued to the cover
of the National Geographic,
February, 1918.

I said to myself: three days
and you'll be seven years old.
I was saying it to stop
the sensation of falling off
the round, turning world.
into cold, blue-black space.
But I felt: you are an I,
you are an Elizabeth,
you are one of them.
Why should you be one, too?
I scarcely dared to look
to see what it was I was.
I gave a sidelong glance
--I couldn't look any higher--
at shadowy gray knees,
trousers and skirts and boots
and different pairs of hands
lying under the lamps.
I knew that nothing stranger
had ever happened, that nothing
stranger could ever happen.

Why should I be my aunt,
or me, or anyone?
What similarities--
boots, hands, the family voice
I felt in my throat, or even
the National Geographic
and those awful hanging breasts--
held us all together
or made us all just one?
How--I didn't know any
word for it--how ""unlikely"". . .
How had I come to be here,
like them, and overhear
a cry of pain that could have
got loud and worse but hadn't?

and too hot. It was sliding
beneath a big black wave,
another, and another.

The poem takes the reader through a narrative series of events that describe a child, likely the poet herself. From her perspective, the child explains how she accompanied her aunt to the dentist's office. While there, she found herself bored by the wait time and the waiting room. She looked around, took note of the adults in the room, picked up a magazine, and began reading and looking at the pictures. It is revealed that this is a copy of National Geographic. It might seem innocent enough, but there are several images in the magazine, accompanied by words like “Long Pig” that greatly distress the girl. She sees herself as brave and strong but the images test her. Those of the women with their breasts revealed are especially troubling to her. She finds herself truly confronted with the adult world for the first time. At this moment she becomes one with all the adults around her, as well as her aunt in the next room. She experiences an overwhelming sensation of being pulled underwater and consumed by dark waves. They represent her dread of the future as well as her inability to escape it."

There would no need for vain wants or desires, all people would find eternal life.

The poem is directed at Sappho and dedicated to an admiration of the Greek poet's work and an analysis of how the author feels connected to her throughout time. The poet wants to create verse that's similarly powerful to what Sappho wrote but never wants to usurp her position. She feels a connection across time and space with this person (and perhaps with writers in general) and this is something that gives her comfort in times of war.

On whose last steps I climb, Trembling at that where I had stood before; When will return the glory of your prime? No more—Oh, never more! 'A Lament' is a deeply pessimistic poem, like many others by Shelley. There is not the least touch of hope in the poem. It is a poem of unadulterated sadness which has a depressing effect upon the reader also. While optimistic readers will revolt against the sentiment of this poem, those who are naturally pessimistic will certainly respond to its mood and will even derive consolation from the fact that they are reading the sentiments of a kindred spirit. 'A Lament' may be regarded as a brief specimen of Shelley's lyrical gift. It is simple in language and sentiment, and has a musical appeal. It also comes with the quality of spontaneity. It is an expression of Shelley's habitual mood of gloom and sadness, although in many other poems Shelley, while lamenting the existence of misfortune and evil in the world, strikes a hopeful note about the future, which is not the case here. It is a bitter poem of real despair. When the poet says: “When will return the glory of your prime?” he asks if the world, life, and time will ever again get back the beauty and joy which once belonged to them. Thus, the poet, by implication, refers to the ancient past glorious period. The present of mankind is, according to him, a period of sadness and evil. The ancient glory of the world will never return. Elsewhere in his poetry, of course, Shelley utters bright prophecies about the future of mankind. Here he sees no ray of hope. Stanza Two Out of the day and night A joy has taken flight; Fresh spring, and summer, and winter hoar, Move my faint heart with grief, but with delight No more—Oh, never more! In the second stanza of 'A Lament', when the poet says “Out of the day and night, A joy has taken flight,” he talks about the joy which used to brighten the night as well as the day, but now seems to have departed. Neither the day nor the night brings with it any joy for the poet. Through the last three lines, when the poet says: Fresh spring, and summer, and winter hoar, Move my faint heart with grief, but with delight, No more—Oh, never more!”, he means that the changing seasons have lost their charm for the poet. Spring, with its beautiful fresh flowers, summer, and winter with its snowfalls merely arouse feelings of sorrow in his heart. They do not give rise to the feelings of delight, which he once used to experience. Nevermore will those feelings of delight visit his heart which now throbs only faintly. The poet feels utterly dispirited, dejected and disappointed with life. A great change seems to him to have taken place in the world. And it seems he does not want to go with that great change. This is the reason why he grieves over the past time he spent, and wishes that the gone moments come again. But he might know that time and tide never comes again. Change is the rule of nature. Everything on this earth is subject to change. The born thing is destined to decay."
1967,1978,1978,"WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD is true. I was in his house. His wife carried
a tray of coffee and sugar. His daughter filed her nails, his son went out for the night. There were daily papers, pet dogs, a pistol on the
cushion beside him. The moon swung bare on its black cord over
the house. On the television was a cop show. It was in English.
Broken bottles were embedded in the walls around the house to
scoop the kneecaps from a man's legs or cut his hands to lace. On
the windows there were gratings like those in liquor stores. We had
dinner, rack of lamb, good wine, a gold bell was on the table for
calling the maid. The maid brought green mangoes, salt, a type of
bread. I was asked how I enjoyed the country. There was a brief
commercial in Spanish. His wife took everything away. There was
some talk then of how difficult it had become to govern. The parrot
said hello on the terrace. The colonel told it to shut up, and pushed
himself from the table. My friend said to me with his eyes: say
nothing. The colonel returned with a sack used to bring groceries
home. He spilled many human ears on the table. They were like
dried peach halves. There is no other way to say this. He took one
of them in his hands, shook it in our faces, dropped it into a water
glass. It came alive there. I am tired of fooling around he said. As
for the rights of anyone, tell your people they can go fuck them-
selves. He swept the ears to the floor with his arm and held the last
of his wine in the air. Something for your poetry, no? he said. Some
of the ears on the floor caught this scrap of his voice. Some of the
ears on the floor were pressed to the ground.

Throughout this poem, the speaker details meeting and dinner she had, along with a friend, at the house of “the colonel.” There, life seems to progress normally, as it would in any other home. The colonel's wife is there, along with his son and daughter. Together, they eat an expensive meal. One that seems unlikely to be gracing any other household in the country. There are also other mundane elements that make the colonel's role in society all the more shocking. There's a cop show on tv and a parrot speaking on the porch. The latter seems to send the colonel into a rage, and things take a turn for the worse. The colonel pulls out his bag of severed ears and dumps them on the table. This horrific turn of events reveals to the reader the truth of this man's nature. It also alludes to the broader horrors occurring within the country. He screams at his guests, taking out his anger on them for any foreign interference with his plans for El Salvador."

C. in a Prospect of Flowers' by Andrew Marvell provides a picture of a girl named “T.C.” who is in search of flowers. The poet seems mesmerized at the purity and beauty of that little soul. How delicate she is! It makes the poet thoughtful about her origin. Her presence makes the flowers rejoice and her innocent talking with the flora around sparkles the poetic imagination of Andrew Marvell. The poet goes into a state of extreme bliss at the same time his mind clouds with the thoughts of the future. What will happen to the little child when she matures? That's the question the poet has left at the end for readers. However, with the vivid imagery of the girl wandering at the bosom of mother nature is a symbol of chastity. This chastity is what the poet calls, “virtuous enemy of man!” In near future, the girl may face sensuous challenges from the arena of “Love”. Still, the poet thinks the innocence of her childish spirit will win the amorous battle, for sure!"

As the poem develops it is made clear that the speaker believes by doing this one will reach a heightened spiritual plane. They will touch the eternal and live in a way that others are unable."
1973,1984,1984,"You are running away from everyone
who loves you,
from your family,
from old lovers, from friends.
They run after you with accumulations
of a former life, copper earrings,
plates of noodles, banners
of many lost revolutions.
You love to say the trees are naked now
because it never happens
in your country. This is a mystery
from which you will never
recover. And yes, the trees are naked now,
everything that still breathes in them
lies silent and stark
and waiting. You love October most
of all, how there is no word
for so much splendor.
This, too, is a source
of consolation. Between you and memory
everything is water. Names of the dead,
or saints, or history.
There is a realm in which
—no, forget it,
it’s still too early to make anyone understand.
A man drives a stake
through his own heart
and afterwards the opposite of nostalgia
begins to make sense: he stops raking the leaves
and the leaves take over
and again he has learned
to let go.","You are running away from everyone who loves you, from your family, from old lovers, from","The Opposite of Nostalgia' by Eric Gamalinda tells the story of a man who escapes from his home country, running away to establish himself in a foreign place. Although it takes time, with things being overwhelming and different, the man settles in to his new life, allowing himself to forget his past in order to be happy with his present. Although we do not know why he left, we know that he leaves friends and family in search of this new life. The end of the poem is inconclusive, we never really know if he finds happiness in this new life."
1974,1985,1985,"A ball will bounce; but less and less. It's not

Falling is what it loves, and the earth falls
So in our hearts from brilliance,
Settles and is forgot.
It takes a sky-blue juggler with five red balls

To shake our gravity up. Whee, in the air

Learning the ways of lightness, alter to spheres
Grazing his finger ends,
Cling to their courses there,
Swinging a small heaven about his ears.

Landing it ball by ball,
And trades it all for a broom, a plate, a table.

Oh, on his toe the table is turning, the broom's
Balancing up on his nose, and the plate whirls
On the tip of the broom! Damn, what a show, we cry:
The boys stamp, and the girls
Shriek, and the drum booms
And all come down, and he bows and says good-bye.

If the juggler is tired now, if the broom stands
In the dust again, if the table starts to drop

Lies flat on the table top,

It's not a light-hearte,"The Juggler' by Richard Wilbur is a beautiful and original poem that uses a juggler as a metaphor for the kind of change one needs in life. The poem suggests that throughout life, human beings become complacent, tired, and bored with life. They take life for granted. It takes moments like the one described in the poem to wake one up and remind them that things can change. The juggler accomplishes this by keeping the red balls in the air and then the table, broom, and plate. "
1975,1986,1986,"It is not the moon, I tell you.
It is these flowers

'Mock Orange' may look like a simple poem filled with images that invite sight, smell, and sound. But, in reality, it is a call for a woman to find her personal identity that is not established by gender. Glück's matter-of-fact style in the poem is added with striking imagery and emotion, to exemplify the theme."
1976,1987,1987,"These times strike monied worldlings with dismay:
Even rich men, brave by nature, taint the air
With words of apprehension and despair:

Sound, healthy, children of the God of heaven,
Are cheerful as the rising sun in May.
What do we gather hence but firmer faith
That every gift of noble origin

That virtue and the faculties within
Are vital,—and that riches are akin
To fear, to change, to cowardice, and death?","These times strike monied worldlings with dismay: Even rich men, brave by nature","'October, 1803′ by William Wordsworth describes England's fear over an expected French invasion and how the speaker sees the world being transformed in the wake of this fear. The speaker begins the sonnet by utilizing the first grouping of four lines to describe the way the rich and noble lords of England are reacting to an impending battle with France. They are not mentally or physically prepared for a fight in their own homeland. They are filled with “apprehension and despair” so much so that they poison the world with it when they breathe. In contrast, there are the men who have much less. These people, who've been given only what is “sufficient” for their own survival, are unreservedly happy. They know what is coming and do not have nearly as much to lose as their counterparts. In the final set of lines, a concluding sestet, the speaker declares his own hopes and those of his followers. He is of the mind that if the French does come, riches will be no defense. The nobles will have nothing but fear, while the working men and women have the value of their interior virtue to fall back upon."
1977,1988,1988,"Oh who is that young sinner with the handcuffs on his wrists?
And what has he been after that they groan and shake their fists?
And wherefore is he wearing such a conscience-stricken air?
Oh they're taking him to prison for the colour of his hair.

In the good old time 'twas hanging for the colour that it is;

Houseman depicts discrimination through the extended metaphor of a young man's hair. In this poem, the speaker depicts the arrest and imprisonment, and later torture, of a young man because, supposedly, of the color of his hair. The hair is used by Houseman in order to represent something else, the man's sexuality. He is, in reality, being arrested for being gay and condemned to hard labor for it. The poem expresses the attitudes of the time, and the tone condemns those who thought and acted that way."
1978,1989,1989,"It was like watching a wave approach

The poet spends the first lines comparing an approaching wave to something. That “something” has to be interpreted. With the title, readers can assume that she's thinking about the climate crisis and the changes that human-made climate change is going to bring to the Earth. By embodying that change as a wave on the horizon, she alludes to one of the primary features of climate change (changing ocean levels) while also defining climate change in an appropriately foreboding way. The people on the beach who are in the most danger are unwilling to understand what they see on the horizon. Instead, they turn back to the sand and their decadent lives. These same people express concern over a child who is caught up in the undertow but are still incapable of seeing the larger picture. When the poem concludes, the wave has arrived, creating a new “sky” over their heads and casting a long shadow."
1979,1990,1990,"I can imagine, in some otherworld

In that most awful stillness, that gasped and hummed,
Humming-birds raced down the avenues.

And went whizzing through the slow, vast, succulent stems.

As mosses, and little lizards, they say, were once big.

Lawrence contains the musings of a speaker enchanted by a hummingbird's fantastical past. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is able to “imagine” a world that is “other” to earth. It is not a different planet, but just far in the past. These days were darker than those he lives in now. The animals were slow and soulless. All except for the hummingbird. This creature was far above the others. It flew wildly down the “avenues” and sucked from the veins of vegetables. He concludes the poem by stating that humanity has gotten the history of this tiny bird wrong, and perhaps that is for the best. Their presence, even in the historical past, would've been too much for modern life to handle."

And made it into smiles.

And lined it deep with pain.
They set the lips, and sagged the cheeks,
And drooped the eyes with sorrow.

'Fletcher McGee' by Edgar Lee Masters revolves around the titular character and his confessions. The poem is an epitaph written on the grave of Fletcher McGee. In the epitaph, the speaker expresses how his wife has brought misery to his life. According to him, they both made each other deplorable. The wife created havoc in his mental state and the husband in response distorted her physical appearance. In consequence, he became agitated with her wife's face and closed himself in his room. At last, his wife died but her spirit hunted the speaker until his death."

Blue lipped and dressed in water’s long green silk
she lay for dead.

Then kneeling on the earth,

her wartime cotton frock soaked,

drawn by the dread of it.

The speaker spends the poem looking back on this very poignant memory from her childhood. She remembers being on the beach and seeing the events of the poem play out. To her eyes, her mother was a “heroine,” breathing her breath into the child's lungs. When the girl was revived, she cried out like a wounded or lost animal. Later, they found out that the girl was beaten by her father for endangering her life. The speaker wonders if this is something she observed or something she heard about later. She isn't sure. The poem ends with an allusion to deeply buried memories, ones that are lost, just like the “poor man's daughter.”"

The stanzas conform to a loose rhyming pattern of abab. There are instances though in which the ‘a’ lines do not always rhyme perfectly. Often they are slant or half-rhymes rather than full, or perfect rhymes. One such instance is in the second stanza with the end sounds, “east” and “vast.”

A reader should also take note of the moment of repetition at the beginning of the verses. A great number of the lines begin with the same word, often in the same stanza. Such as in stanza one with “And” beginning the first and second line. Or, in stanza three in which “The” begins lines three and four."

where the family sheltered in place.
How he cared for his armored friend.

The boy struggles with this knowledge, wanting to take the turtle with him. He does this out of compassion, wanting to build the turtle a home and 'care for his armoured friend'. The parent understands where he is coming from, having 'picked flowers, knowing they'd die'. Levine reveals the truth that everything in nature has its rightful place, removing the beautiful or exotic will cause them to die. Nature, and beauty, are transient, with Sheltered in Place focusing on the impermanence of life, a child learning what death is."

'The Suicide's Soliloquy' by Abraham Lincoln sounds like a suicide note of a depressed person who has lost hope in this mundane. There is a note at the beginning of the poem. It says the lines of the poem were said to have been found near the bones of a man who possibly committed suicide, in a deep forest, on the flat branch of the Sangamon, some times ago. However, in this poem, the speaker is resolved to kill himself with a dagger. Before killing himself, he is thinking about why he is going to do so. It seems he might be reassuring himself about the deed he is going to commit. To sum up, he has lost hope in his worldly life and he has nobody to share his pain with. Hence, there is no other way available to him except for suicide."

She felt like a prodigal daughter, while Africa received her with the unconditional love of a mother. In 'The Mothering Blackness' a young girl is confronted with the problem of returning home. She is running home in the dark crying because she knew she did something that her mother wouldn't agree with. In her journey back home, she worries that her mother will not accept her. She is “creeping” back home because she feels ashamed of what she did. But the lines intended, show otherwise for despite knowing what the daughter has done, her mother, wanting her to come back. The intended lines portray their mother and daughter relationship's complexity and allow both their points of view to be seen."

On the Pot,"'July in Washington,' written in 1964 by Robert Lowell, is about the United States of America, especially the capital city Washington, D.C., and its pros and cons. The poem begins with the comparison of America to a “wheel,” which indicates its significance, as it is said to touch every part of the earth. The first line itself indicates the influence the USA had on the world. No one was unaware of its greatness and courage. As the poem continues, readers find that though the speaker is proud of his nation, there are many flaws to its fame. America is beautiful, no doubt, but the political status of America is not appropriate. According to Lowell, “they come here bright as dimes,/ and die dishevelled and soft.” The poem mirrors the poet's state of mind. He is a proud citizen of America and, at the same time, disapproves of its political strategies. Lowell had been to jail for his protest against the military rule. This shows that he disagreed with ideologies related to politics. In this poem, he describes the natural beauty of America, with its mountains, rivers, and otters, and then he silently wishes for another shore. He, like the other Americans, wants a different ending. The poem was written after World War II, and thus it states the terror that still dominated the time. As Lowell ends by saying that nothing seems to be in control, his helplessness and desperate need for a new and better world are voiced through this poem."

She knows that this ability to create doesn't come from the spirit, instead, it comes from ignorant “habit.” No emotional passion could be responsible, she suggests."

It isn't particularly clever but it does use a lot of metaphors with the narrator claiming they want to be like various inanimate objects in order to signify their feelings for the person that they are in love with. Perhaps unsurprisingly the poem has a strong sense of rhythm. This is very much a trademark of John Cooper Clarke being as most of his poetry is set to music. It is presented in 8 stanzas. There is a mostly consistent rhyming pattern (ABABCCC) with the final line not rhyming, but acting as a refrain. These changes in the last stanza probably to draw attention to the line, to emphasize it."
